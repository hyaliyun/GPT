This drama about a massacre in Yemen takes on unexpected interest because the main character, a fiery-eyed Marine combat hero played by Samuel L. Jackson, is presented as a believably flawed man.","completion":"The movie being reviewed is \\"Rules of Engagement\\" directed by William Friedkin and released in 2000. The film stars Samuel L. Jackson as Marine Colonel Terry Childers, who is a combat hero with fiery eyes and a believably flawed persona. The drama centers around a massacre in Yemen, which adds unexpected interest to the film's plot. \\"Rules of Engagement\\" tells the story of Colonel Terry Childers, who leads a team to rescue the U.S. ambassador and his family in Yemen. As they face major obstacles and retaliate against hostile forces, Childers becomes embroiled in controversy after several innocent Yemeni civilians are killed during the mission. He is returned to the United States, where he faces a court-martial for his actions. The film explores the ethical dilemmas faced by military personnel during times of conflict and raises questions about the rules of engagement in such situations. The narrative is driven by the relationship between Childers and his friend, a lawyer named Colonel Hays Hodges, played by Tommy Lee Jones. Hodges comes out of retirement to defend Childers in court, as they have a history of serving together in combat. Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of the believably flawed character Colonel Terry Childers is one of the key aspects that make \\"Rules of Engagement\\" intriguing. His fiery-eyed demeanor as a Marine combat hero adds depth to the character, making viewers question the morality of his choices and actions during the mission in Yemen. This drama provides an engaging exploration of the complex nature of war and the individuals involved, touching on themes of loyalty, honor, and sacrifice. As the audience follows the gripping courtroom drama and the moral predicaments faced by the main character, \\"Rules of Engagement\\" proves to be thought-provoking. The intense performances by both Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones are noteworthy, and the film sheds light on the realities of military life. Despite receiving mixed reviews, it remains an engaging and thought-provoking film that raises important questions about the rules of engagement and the ethical dilemmas faced by those who serve in the military."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

How is \\"Capuchin\\" said in Russian?","completion":"\\"Capuchin\\" can be translated into Russian as \\"Капуцин\\" (Kaputsin). Capuchin typically refers to one of two different things: a capuchin monkey or a capuchin friar. In the context of capuchin monkeys, the term \\"Капуцин\\" directly applies. Capuchin monkeys (also known as sapajou) belong to the genus Cebus and are known for their intelligence and unique behaviors. They are found in Central and South America and are often recognized for their distinctive tuft of hair on top of their head. Capuchin monkeys are named after the Capuchin friars because the monkeys' fur coloring resembles the friars' cowls. In the context of capuchin friars, however, the translation would be \\"Капуцинский монах\\" (Kaputsinskiy monakh), which directly translates to \\"Capuchin monk.\\" Capuchin friars are members of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, a Roman Catholic religious order founded in the 16th century. They follow the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi and adhere to a simple, humble lifestyle. The name \\"Capuchin\\" is derived from the Italian word \\"cappuccio,\\" which means \\"hood\\" – a reference to the particular hooded robe worn by the members of this order. In summary, \\"Capuchin\\" can be translated into Russian as \\"Капуцин\\" (Kaputsin) when referring to capuchin monkeys, and as \\"Капуцинский монах\\" (Kaputsinskiy monakh) when referring to capuchin friars. It is crucial to consider the context when using these translations to convey the correct meaning in Russian."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years.

Bain’s jobs data: Under lock and key It turns out there is a way to determine how many jobs Mitt Romney helped to create or destroy while running Bain Capital. Unfortunately, we aren’t allowed to do it. A handful of academics – including Harvard’s Josh Lerner and the University of Chicago’s Steve Davis – last year published a working paper titled Private Equity and Employment. It basically defied conventional wisdom on both sides, arguing that private equity investment only has “a modest net impact on employment.” To arrive at that conclusion, the researchers constructed a dataset that relied on U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database (which is derived from IRS records). It then used Capital IQ and other financial sources to match up the LBD employment records with thousands of private equity transactions. In other words, while Bain Capital and other PE firms didn’t keep track of their portfolio payroll data, the government did. And some academics connected the dots. Unfortunately, it seems that access to the LBD is highly conditional. Lerner and Davis were required to use the data only in the aggregate, promising not to report any identifying information about any specific organization – even if that organization was not specifically included in the LBD (i.e., financial sponsors). In fact, Census and the IRS screen all such working papers before they can be released, in order to make sure no identifying data is disclosed.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the person who asked Wolfgang to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel? ? The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea.

Sentence from a movie review: dull plots Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the phrase \\"dull plots\\" from the movie review, it can be inferred that the reviewer likely had a negative perception of the movie. A movie with dull plots implies that its storylines were not engaging or lacked originality and excitement, which are usually essential elements to maintain a viewer's interest. However, it is important to recognize that this is just one aspect of the movie being critiqued, and a single sentence from the review may not be enough to determine the overall evaluation of the film. Even a movie with dull plots may have positive attributes such as exceptional acting, beautiful cinematography, or an outstanding musical score that could contribute to the viewer's experience. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the reviewer's perception of the movie, it would be helpful to read the entire review or look at other phrases or sentences that comment on different aspects like the direction, special effects, or the performances of the actors. In conclusion, although the given phrase \\"dull plots\\" suggests that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer in terms of its storyline, it is necessary to consider the totality of the movie review to gauge the overall evaluation of the film, as other elements might provide a more positive outlook or a mixed opinion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We'll subtract 17*h from both sides of the equation to do that. 40*h - 17*h = 17*h - 17*h + 736 This becomes: 23*h = 736 Now, we need to find the value of \\"h\\".

The shooter was lying nearby in an open area, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman said. For The Record Los Angeles Times Tuesday, December 20, 2011 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 News Desk 1 inches; 53 words Type of Material: Correction Irwindale shooting: An item in the Page 1 index in the Dec. 17 Section A erred in saying a man with a rifle had opened fire at Southern California Edison offices in Irwindale. As reported in the full article, in the LATExtra section, the weapon recovered at the scene was a semiautomatic handgun. A third man was pronounced dead at a hospital. The other two employees, a man and a woman, remained hospitalized in critical condition Friday evening, Sheriff's Lt. Holly Francisco said. Sheriff's homicide detectives recovered a semiautomatic handgun at the scene. Francisco said it appeared the gunman and the victims had all worked together. The shooter was at work in the morning, she added. \\"We don't know if he left and came back,\\" she said. \\"Witnesses are being interviewed now.\\" Theodore F. Craver Jr., chief executive of Edison International, confirmed that the gunman and three of the shooting victims were employees of the information technology unit. The fourth victim, one of those critically wounded, was a contract worker. Neither the shooter nor the victims were identified because relatives are still being notified. \\"It is a very sad day for us,\\" Craver said outside the gates of the Edison complex. \\"Our hearts and prayers go out to families of the employees.\\" About 1,100 people, mostly information technology staff, work in the offices, Craver said. Employees need a key card to get into the facility, he said. The gated complex at 4910 Rivergrade Road, just off the 605 Freeway, consists of two, two-story buildings and the three-story building where the shooting took place. When the shooting started, employees hunkered down in their offices or break rooms, piling equipment in front of the doors, one worker said. Baldwin Park Police Capt. Michael Taylor said SWAT officers feared there might be a second gunman and searched the building room by room, rescuing barricaded employees along the way. Some of the workers were seen in TV news reports walking out of the building with their hands up to show they had no weapons. Employees said Edison, in an email, instructed them not to speak to the media. Hours after the shooting, several workers huddled outside the gates, crying and hugging a manager. Nearby schools were locked down for a brief period until authorities were sure that the gunman was dead. Times staff writer Gale Holland contributed to this report. Summary:","completion":"A man who worked at an office went to his workplace and used a gun to hurt people. He shot and killed two other workers and also hurt two more people very badly before he stopped himself from living using the gun. The police came and found the gun the man used, and helped the other people in the office. It was a very sad day for the people who worked there, and our thoughts go to the families of those who were hurt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In a video recorded this month, Roald Van Stijn captured thousands of flocking starlings flying in stunning formation. Although the 36-year-old had been visiting different sites known for starling spotting for three years, every other time he'd attempted to record the beautiful sight, something had got in the way. In a video recorded this month, Roald Van Stijn captured thousands of starlings flying above Utrecht. The flocks of birds created stunning formations as they 'danced' high above the city skyline. '[Before] it was too dark already or there were too many buildings or trees in the frame,' Van Stijn told MailOnline. 'Many times the starlings just flew as a flock and didn't show the dancing. 'This time I finally got everything right - and even better, it was just five minutes from my home.' The nature-lover had been visiting the site for three years in hopes of recording a good video of the birds. 'This time, I got everything right,' he says. 'And even better, it was just five minutes from my home.' 'Every year the birds flock somewhere else,' he explains. 'This suburb has a flock every year, but normally smaller flocks. 'This flock is really amazing: huge and not that common.' While it is common to see starlings in the Netherlands, it's rare to see this many all in one place. Roald Van Stijn says that filming starlings in these optimal conditions was high on his bucket list. 'I love the wonders of nature,' Van Stijn says of his passion for amateur outdoor film making. 'Last summer, I finally filmed a lightning strike in super slow motion and last month, I made a timelapse of the Northern Lights. 'Filming starlings in these conditions was high on my bucket list.' Highlights:","completion":"1. A remarkable sight was captured by nature enthusiast Roald Van Stijn this month in Utrecht, the Netherlands, where thousands of starlings were filmed in an extraordinary flight formation. 2. Van Stijn, 36, had been frequenting known locations for starling sightings in hope of recording the spectacle. This time, however, he accomplished the task just five minutes away from his home. 3. In previous attempts, multiple obstacles like excessive darkness, too many buildings or trees in the shot, or the starlings' uncoordinated flight hampered Van Stijn's filming efforts. 4. The video showcases the starlings flying as a sizable flock against the city skyline backdrop, whimsically transforming their formations - an occurrence described as 'dancing' by the capturer. 5. Although starlings are a common sight in the Netherlands, witnessing a flock of this magnitude in one location is reportedly unusual. Van Stijn noted that while the suburb he filmed in sees a flock annually, normally they are of a smaller size. 6. The achievement of capturing the birds under such ideal conditions was a significant check off Van Stijn's bucket list. He had already managed to film a lightning strike in slow motion and produce a timelapse of the Northern Lights. 7. This accomplishment reaffirms Van Stijn's passion for outdoor film making, driven by his fascination for the wonders of nature. His persistence over three years to capture this natural spectacle under perfect conditions underlines his enduring dedication."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. To say Funky Forest: The First Contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions. I can really get into a good art house film, even a surreal and twisted romp like El Topo, Naked Lunch, and Survive Style 5+, because those movies actually have something worth discussing when the credits roll. FFFC attempts at every avenue to be this deep and intellectual, essentially there is no substance in this movie. This movie is badly done, the visuals in this movie are not inspiring, the dialog is worse, the musical numbers destroy this movie.. I chuckled for GUITAR BROTHERS, but that was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary, and irrelevant. It attempted to be deep and meaningful I think, but its just pretentious disoriented nonsense. Freshman film students without a camera could craft something more interesting. Guitar Brothers and the stand up routines in between skits get 1 point each, everything else is just badly paced, pseudo-creative, heavy handed attempts at being AS good as films by other REAL directors like, Sogo Ishii, David Lynch, and Jodoworsky. Give me a break. I am convinced that people that rave about FFFC are doing so because they have no idea of what they saw, because it was nothing but mild pertinent statements here and there mixed with stupidity and blended until you puke on your own shoes. This movie was an extreme disappointment, coming off the high that was Survive Style 5+, a film that actually has meaning, combined with excellent use of scenery, cinematography, catchy dialog, funny moments, good soundtrack, excellent performances, fantastic pacing and flow. FFFC features the exact opposite in every way, boring scenery (20 minutes staring at a bland beach at night? a completely white stage? Alien balls floating in white space? a dinky school hallway and then a... school hallway?), terrible cinematography, forgettable dialog, nothing funny or humorous, save the fact you just wasted your life for two hours, soundtrack?, amateurish performances, uneven, disjointed, and often flat out dragging pacing, zero flow whatsoever. There are those that claim this is what makes FFFC a great movie, that it is so unconventional at every turn that its pure genius. This is simply a way to stroke your own ego it seems, because \\"unpredictable\\" could be a good quality for a film if it wasn't coupled with \\"boring\\", \\"innane\\", and \\"terrible\\". Personally I have spoken with two people who admitted to me that FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but overwhelming rave by art-house elitist made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with a... \\"Hey it was pretty good I liked it\\". I'm going to put my foot down, this movie is slop, I don't care if Roger Ebert says this film is the best thing he's ever watched since he lost his own virginity. \\"The Emperor's new cloak\\" I say... this movie is no way indicative of the other psychedelic/trippy films to come from Japan in the last 10 years. Taste of Tea, Party 7, and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies (even with a low budget), and none can honestly compare with Survive Style 5+. Watch FFFC only if your interested in making a pretentious pile of nothing on a shoestring budget. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is very negative. The person really did not like the movie Funky Forest: The First Contact and thinks it is a badly made film. They think it is boring, not funny, and has no real meaning. They also believe that people who say it's good might just be trying to sound smart, instead of really enjoying the film.

Available options: --yes; --it is not possible to tell; --no;","completion":"Yes, it follows that \\"I work as a contract person, and we get random drug tests.\\" Your statement clearly indicates that as a contract person, you are subject to random drug testing as part of the requirements for your contracted position. It is not uncommon for contract employees to undergo random drug testing, as many employers want to ensure a safe and productive work environment. The purpose of random drug testing is to deter the use of prohibited substances and identify individuals who may be using drugs. This testing method helps protect both the company and the employees by promoting safety, reducing absenteeism, and increasing productivity. Random drug testing can be performed without prior notice and usually involves a selection of employees from a designated pool, ensuring that every employee has an equal chance of being selected. These tests can currently detect the presence of various substances, including marijuana, cocaine, opioids, amphetamines, and other drugs. It is essential for contract employees to familiarize themselves with their employer's drug policy, as well as any potential consequences for a positive drug test, such as disciplinary actions, removal from the contracted position, or even termination of the contract. Understanding and adhering to these policies is crucial to maintaining a professional relationship with the contracting company and ensuring a safe and efficient work environment for all involved. In conclusion, given that you work as a contract person and mentioned that your position entails random drug testing, it does follow that \\"I work as a contract person, and we get random drug tests.\\" It is crucial for you to be aware of your employer's drug policy and stay compliant with it, as failing a drug test could lead to unfavorable consequences."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Are the particles in Emily's pizza moving faster or slower than in Lauren's pizza? Matt is reheating some leftover pizza in the microwave for his stepchildren, Lauren and Emily. Lauren likes her pizza at a high temperature when reheated so Matt cooks it for a long time. Emily likes her pizza at a lower temperature so Matt only puts hers in the microwave for a couple seconds. Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Answer:","completion":"The particles in Emily's pizza are moving slower than in Lauren's pizza."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Solution:","completion":"The other name for the world's largest dōjinshi fair held twice a year in Tokyo, Japan is \\"Comiket\\" or \\"Comic Market\\". Here's how I used the definition to come up with the answer: 1. The question states that it is a dōjinshi fair, which means it is an event where self-published, fan-created works called dōjinshi are showcased and sold. 2. The question also mentions that it takes place twice a year in Tokyo, Japan, so we are looking for a recurring event in that location. 3. The question provides additional information about the event being the location of the first release of a Japanese adult dōjin visual novel created by Type-Moon in 2000, which also hints at the importance and popularity of this event in the dōjin community. 4.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: People often complain they face too many problems. Every day and everywhere there are problems. Many times we find it hard to stay happy. When one problem is solved, another one comes up. People have money problems, work problems, family problems, health problems..... the list goes on. And we usually think that people who are happy and successful are having fewer problems than us. Look at the successful people we often mention. They have money they need, they have jobs they love, they have good friends, they have obedient kids, they have the successful business, they have loving families etc. Everything goes well with them. That is why they are happy and successful. But in fact, the more successful you are, the more problems you have to face. More success means more challenges they have to face, and more success means more risks they have to take. Young and old, rich and poor, successful and unsuccessful, educated and uneducated, all have problems. The difference is that their problems are different from each other. Rich and successful have big problems. Poor and unsuccessful have small problems. Still they all have problems which they can face. Successful people are successful just because they are ready to face challenges larger than ordinary people. Winning the US elections makes Obama very happy. As a new US president, he has to face bigger challenges. He has to be more careful about his work he does, or he will lose his position . Looking at him, we may say he is lucky, happy and successful.

Summarize this article: Almost any sport requires you to coordinate between your eyes and your hands. Pick up a sport that's interesting to you, and make it part of your regular weekly routine. Set a goal of play for an hour 3-4 times a week. Look into intramural teams or classes in your area to help keep your practice consistent and make the process more fun. Sports that involve bats or sticks such as baseball, softball, hockey, and lacrosse are all common recommendations for those looking to improve their coordination. You could also consider getting a badminton net, volleyball net, basketball hoop, or ping pong table for your home if you want to practice on your own time. Boxing and many forms of martial arts are also great to help improve eye-hand coordination. Look into classes in your area for boxing, mixed martial arts (MMA), taekwondo, karate, krav maga, or any other form of martial arts that interests you. Video games require both motor skills and visual perception to execute gameplay. Play a game that requires precision timing, a sensitive touch, and/or great attention to detail, and you may find it helps improve your overall eye-hand coordination. Action games like Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed can be particularly useful for this purpose. Try different types of games, if you have the systems available. Console games, PC games, and VR games will all challenge you in different ways. Learning to juggle is a common activity recommended for people trying to improve their coordination. Start by learning to juggle with 2 balls, then move your way up to three. Consult online tutorials and videos to help get you started, since juggling is often better understood visually. Don't get disheartened if you're not a great juggler when you first start. This is an activity that takes a lot of time to master. Keep practicing and you will slowly start to see benefits with your overall hand-eye coordination. This requires picking up specific pieces to analyze which ones fit together, using and improving both hand-eye coordination and reasoning skills. Challenge yourself even more with a 3D jigsaw puzzle, a Lego sculpture, or another building toy that allows you to think in 3D. This creative activity helps you learn to visually control your hands and fingers by working in the lines on the page. Look for a coloring book that will challenge you with fine lines and details throughout the page. Adult coloring books are gaining popularity, and are readily available at many craft stores and bookstores.

Angela was better at training the new puppy than Lindsey, because","completion":"Angela had always been the patient one in the family. Growing up on a small farm with a menagerie of animals, she had developed a keen sense for understanding and communicating with them. Whether it was a rebellious piglet, a mischievous goat, or an independent-minded tomcat, Angela had worked her magic with them all. So, when the new puppy arrived at their home a few weeks ago, her family naturally assumed that Angela would take charge of the little one's upbringing. Lindsey, on the other hand, had always been the extrovert and the family's social butterfly. While she enjoyed the company of their animal friends as much as her sister, Lindsey found it difficult to stay still for long periods of time and give them the attention they required. Her passions were more aligned with human interactions, shopping, and spending her free time with her numerous friends. When Lindsey tried to handle the puppy, her restless energy often made the small animal anxious and confused. This led to the puppy becoming less responsive to her commands or instructions, and in turn, frustrated Lindsey. Hence, Angela was better at training the new puppy than Lindsey. As the days went by, Angela spent hours slowly building the trust and bond with the little puppy, whom they had named Willow. She poured her love, patience, and understanding into her training sessions, and the results were impressive. Willow had already mastered \\"sit\\", \\"stay\\", and \\"heel,\\" and was on her way to learning more complex commands. Angela's gentle, firm tone and consistent routine helped the shy puppy find comfort in her presence and develop a close attachment. Lindsey couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy - she loved Willow and wanted the puppy to listen and follow her commands just like she did with Angela. Seeing her sister's struggle, Angela offered to teach Lindsey the techniques she used for training Willow. Lindsey, swallowing her pride, agreed to work alongside Angela and learn from her expertise. Over the next few weeks, Angela shared her knowledge with Lindsey, guiding her through the nuances of animal behavior, understanding their body language as well as their responses to different cues. Although it was a slow and laborious process, Lindsey was eventually able to calm herself down and approach the puppy training with greater patience and focus. Under the tutelage of Angela and the gentle encouragement of Willow, Lindsey gradually began to find her footing in animal training. She discovered that, despite her outgoing nature and high energy, she had a natural ability to form deep connections with animals when she gave them her undivided attention. The puppy started responding positively to Lindsey's commands and grew more comfortable in her presence, creating an environment where both Lindsey and Willow could learn from each other. As the siblings worked together, not only did Willow blossom into an obedient, well-socialized, and happy dog, but Angela and Lindsey forged a stronger bond with one another. They admired each other's strengths and supported each other's weaknesses. The once seemingly insurmountable obstacle had been turned into an opportunity for personal growth and understanding for the sisters. In time, Angela and Lindsey realized that, together, they could achieve more than they ever could alone. They decided to use their combined abilities to help other families train and understand their pets, establishing a successful dog training and obedience school in their community. Brought together by a puppy named Willow, the sisters found happiness, purpose, and unity through their shared love for animals and each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: How do I promote my business blog in social media? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Yes, the answers to these two questions would be quite similar since they both involve promoting a blog on social media. However, the second question specifies promoting a \\"business blog,\\" which may require a slightly different approach. Here is a detailed and long answer that covers both questions. Question 1: What is the best way to promote a blog on social media? To effectively promote a blog on social media, follow these steps: 1. Identify your target audience: Before you start promoting your blog, it is crucial to determine who your target audience is. Knowing your audience helps you tailor your content and promotional efforts to attract and engage them better. 2. Choose the appropriate platforms: Focus on social media platforms that are popular among your target audience and best suited for your content. For instance, if your blog content is highly visual, platforms like Instagram and Pinterest can be effective, while Twitter is better for short, concise updates and Facebook for longer, more engaging conversations. 3. Share high-quality, valuable content: Make sure your blog contains high-quality content that provides genuine value to your audience. Sharing valuable content increases the likelihood of your followers sharing it, resulting in increased visibility and traffic. 4. Consistency: Post content regularly to keep your audience engaged and maintain their interest. Consistency is vital in driving traffic to your blog and generating a loyal following. 5. Use eye-catching visuals: Eye-catching visuals, such as images, videos, or infographics, can significantly improve your social media posts' performance by attracting your audience's attention and encouraging them to visit your blog. 6. Utilize hashtags: Use relevant hashtags strategically to reach a larger audience. Research trending hashtags within your niche and incorporate them into your posts. 7. Engage with your audience: Respond to comments, answer questions, and participate in discussions. Building relationships with your audience is essential for increasing brand loyalty and blog visits. 8. Collaborate with influencers: Partner with influencers in your niche to reach new audiences and gain credibility. 9. Promote your blog in your social media profiles: Include the blog link in your social media profiles and bios, and create a social media policy that encourages your team members to share the blog on their profiles as well. 10. Analyze and optimize: Use analytics tools to track your social media efforts' performance, and make improvements accordingly to maximize the results. Question 2: How do I promote my business blog in social media? While the general steps for promoting any blog on social media would still apply, here are some additional tips specific to promoting a business blog: 1. Align your blog with your business goals: Your business blog should provide value to your audience while supporting your business objectives (e.g., increasing brand awareness, generating leads, or establishing your company as an industry leader). Create content that aligns with these goals for maximum impact. 2. Cross-promote with other departments or teams: Encourage different departments within your business to collaborate on content topics and combine their expertise. This collaboration will not only create diverse and valuable content but also bring new audiences from participating teams' networks. 3. LinkedIn: LinkedIn is an excellent platform for promoting a business blog, especially B2B businesses. Post your blog content on LinkedIn and engage in relevant industry discussion groups to increase your blog's visibility among professionals. 4. Use paid advertising: Consider using sponsored posts, ads, or promoted tweets to expand your blog's reach, target a specific audience, or promote high-priority content. Paid advertising can be effective in giving your content a boost when organic growth is insufficient. 5. Share customer case studies and testimonials: Highlighting success stories about how customers benefited from your business or product can bolster credibility and create interest in your blog. 6. Leverage industry events: Attend and promote your blog at industry events, conferences, and workshops to network with others in your niche and attract new readers. By following these specific strategies for both general blog promotion and business blog promotion, you should be able to effectively promote your blog on social media and generate interest in your content."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Darwin's frog and its cousin the Chile Darwin's frog are both named after. naturalist and evolutionist Charles Darwin. As its name suggests, the Chile Darwin's frog is endemic to Chile, while its cousin was also found in Argentina. Darwin first discovered the Rhinodermatidae darwinii species in 1834 in south Chile. during his voyage around the globe. The species have a distinct appearance, having evolved to look like a leaf, with a pointy nose. Darwin's frogs are small, reaching a size of only 3cm in length. Professor Andrew Cunningham from ZSL's Institute of Zoology said: ‘Only a few examples of the 'extinction by infection' phenomenon exist. ‘Although not entirely conclusive, the possibility of chytridiomycosis being associated with the extinction of the northern Darwin's frog gains further support with this study.’ The scientists claim the plummeting numbers and the disappearance of the creatures from most of their territory across Chile and Argentina cannot be explained by habitat loss alone. Hundreds of specimens of Darwin's frogs and other amphibians from similar habitats were collected between 1835 and 1989. Each were tested in order to find DNA pieces of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungus that causes the disease chytridiomycosis. Scientists claim the plummeting numbers of the Darwin's frog, pictured, and the disappearance of the creatures from most of their territory across Chile and Argentina cannot be explained by habitat loss alone. The disease is called chytridiomycosis and comes from a fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) In addition, 26 populations of Darwin's frogs were surveyed in Chile and Argentina between 2008 and 2012 for the presence of Bd. Research leader Dr. Claudio. Soto-Azat, from UNAB and former ZSL PhD student said: ‘Amphibians have. inhabited the earth for 365 million years, far longer than mammals. ‘We may have already lost one species, the northern Darwin's frog, but we cannot risk losing the other one. There is still time to protect this incredible species. ‘Amphibians provide an important ecosystem service by maintaining balance in the environment. Without them insect plagues and their subsequent effect on agriculture and public health would be more frequent. ‘ZSL scientists are working to further understand the reasons behind the extinction of Darwin's frogs, and ensure the long-term survival of the species.’ Darwin's frog and its cousin the Chile Darwin's frog are both named after naturalist and evolutionist Charles Darwin. The species, pictured, has a distinct appearance, having evolved to look like a leaf, with a pointy nose. Darwin's frogs are small, reaching a size of only 3cm in length. Highlights:","completion":"1. The Darwin's frog and its cousin, the Chile Darwin's frog, are believed to be extinct, having not been seen for several months. The conclusion comes from scientists from the Zoological Society of London and Universidad Andris Bello. 2. The cause of extinction is thought to be chytridiomycosis, a deadly amphibian disease originating from a fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. 3. Named after evolutionist Charles Darwin, these small, distinct frogs evolved to look like a leaf and were endemic to Chile and Argentina, found by Darwin in 1834 during his voyage around the globe. 4. The extinction cannot be explained by habitat loss alone. Hundreds of specimens were collected between 1835 and 1989, all of which were tested for DNA pieces of the fungus. 5. Despite the potential loss of the species, researchers believe there's still time to protect the remaining members of this family. These frogs balance the ecosystem, preventing insect plagues that could impact agriculture and public health. 6. Ongoing work by the ZSL aims to understand more about the reasons leading to Darwin's frog's extinction and ensure the long-term survival of such species. In the process of writing these highlights, I read through the provided article and pulled out the key details. This includes the presumed extinction of the Darwin's frog, the cause of the extinction, historical facts about the species, and measures being taken to protect other similar species. By restructuring these details into standalone points, I have created a digestible summary of the article."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Information: - Henry Norris Russell (October 25, 1877 February 18, 1957) was an American astronomer who, along with Ejnar Hertzsprung, developed the HertzsprungRussell diagram (1910). In 1923, working with Frederick Saunders, he developed RussellSaunders coupling which is also known as LS coupling. - The radial velocity of an object with respect to a given point is the rate of change of the distance between the object and the point. That is, the radial velocity is the component of the object's velocity that points in the direction of the radius connecting the object and the point. In astronomy, the point is usually taken to be the observer on Earth, so the radial velocity then denotes the speed with which the object moves away from or approaches the Earth. - Variable Star is a 2006 novel written by Spider Robinson based on the surviving seven pages of an eight-page 1955 novel outline by the late Robert A. Heinlein. The book is set in a divergent offshoot of Heinlein's Future History and contains many references to works by Heinlein and other authors. It describes the coming of age of a young musician who signs on to the crew of a starship as a way of escaping from a failed romance. Robinson posted a note on his website in 2009 noting that his agent had sold a trilogy of sequels based on the novel and its characters. - The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time. Velocity is equivalent to a specification of its speed and direction of motion (e.g. to the north). Velocity is an important concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies. - In astronomy, the main sequence is a continuous and distinctive band of stars that appears on plots of stellar color versus brightness. These color-magnitude plots are known as HertzsprungRussell diagrams after their co-developers, Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell. Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or \\"dwarf\\" stars. - Rapidly oscillating Ap stars ( roAp stars ) are a subtype of the Ap star class that exhibit short - timescale rapid photometric or radial velocity variations . The known periods range between 5 and 23 min. They lie in the delta Scuti instability strip on the main sequence . - A Delta Scuti variable (sometimes termed dwarf cepheid) is a variable star which exhibits variations in its luminosity due to both radial and non-radial pulsations of the star's surface. The variables are important standard candles and have been used to establish the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, globular clusters, open clusters, and the Galactic center. The variables follow a period-luminosity relation in certain passbands like other standard candles such as Cepheids. SX Phoenicis variables are generally considered to be a subclass of Delta Scuti variables that contain old stars, and can be found in globular clusters. SX Phe variables also follow a period-luminosity relation. The recently discovered Rapidly oscillating Ap stars are also a subclass of Delta Scuti variables, found on the main sequence. One last sub-class are the pre-main sequence (PMS) Delta Scuti variables. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Ejnar Hertzsprung (8 October 1873 21 October 1967) was a Danish chemist and astronomer, born in Copenhagen, Denmark. In the period 19111913, together with Henry Norris Russell, he developed the HertzsprungRussell diagram. - The horizontal branch (HB) is a stage of stellar evolution that immediately follows the red giant branch in stars whose masses are similar to the Sun's. Horizontal-branch stars are powered by helium fusion in the core (via the triple-alpha process) and by hydrogen fusion (via the CNO cycle) in a shell surrounding the core. The onset of core helium fusion at the tip of the red giant branch causes substantial changes in stellar structure, resulting in an overall reduction in luminosity, some contraction of the stellar envelope, and the surface reaching higher temperatures. - The HertzsprungRussell diagram, abbreviated HR diagram or HRD, is a scatter graph of stars showing the relationship between the stars' absolute magnitudes or luminosities versus their stellar classifications or effective temperatures. More simply, it plots each star on a graph measuring the star's brightness against its temperature (color). It does not map any locations of stars. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - A Cepheid variable (or ) is a type of star that pulsates radially, varying in both diameter and temperature and producing changes in brightness with a well-defined stable period and amplitude. - The unqualified term instability strip usually refers to a region of the HertzsprungRussell diagram largely occupied by several related classes of pulsating variable stars: Delta Scuti variables, SX Phoenicis variables, and rapidly oscillating Ap stars (roAps) near the main sequence; RR Lyrae variables where it intersects the horizontal branch; and the Cepheid variables where it crosses the supergiants.

A:","completion":"A 'rapidly oscillating Ap star' (or roAp star) has the relation 'subclass of' with Delta Scuti variables.

Cimino was born in New York City on February 3, 1939. A third-generation Italian-American, Cimino and his brothers grew up with their parents in Old Westbury, Long Island. He was regarded as a prodigy at the private schools his parents sent him to, but rebelled as an adolescent by consorting with delinquents, getting into fights, and coming home drunk. Of this time, Cimino described himself as \\"always hanging around with kids my parents didn't approve of. Cimino graduated from Westbury High School in 1956. He entered Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. At Michigan State, Cimino majored in graphic arts, was a member of a weight-lifting club, and participated in a group to welcome incoming students. He graduated in 1959 with honors and won the Harry Suffrin Advertising Award. He was described in the 1959 Red Cedar Log yearbook as having tastes that included blondes, Thelonious Monk, Chico Hamilton, Mort Sahl, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, and \\"drinking, preferably vodka.\\" In Cimino's final year at Michigan State, he became art director, and later managing editor, of the school's humor magazine Spartan. Steven Bach wrote of Cimino's early magazine work: \\"It is here that one can see what are perhaps the first public manifestations of the Cimino visual sensibility, and they are impressive. He thoroughly restyled the Spartan's derivative Punch look, designing a number of its strikingly handsome covers himself. The Cimino-designed covers are bold and strong, with a sure sense of space and design. They compare favorably to professional work honored in, say, any of the Modern Publicity annuals of the late fifties and are far better than the routine work turned out on Madison Avenue. The impact and quality of his work no doubt contributed to his winning the Harry Suffrin Advertising Award at MSU and perhaps to his acceptance at Yale.\\" At Yale, Cimino continued to study painting as well as architecture and art history and became involved in school dramatics. In 1962, while still at Yale, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve. He trained for five months at Fort Dix, New Jersey and had a month of medical training in Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Cimino graduated from Yale University, receiving his BFA in 1961 and his MFA in 1963, both in painting. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Sure kiddo, that sounds like a lot of information, doesn't it? Let's break it down. This story is about a man named Cimino who was born in New York, on February 3, 1939. His family is Italian-American, which means his grandparents or great-grandparents came from Italy. As a young kid, he was very smart, but as he got a tad older, he started getting into a bit of trouble too. After finishing high school, he went to a place called Michigan State University, where he studied graphic arts - that's like drawing, but on a computer mostly. He was also in a weight-lifting club. He did really well in college and even got an award for his work in advertising - that's like making cool pictures and words to help sell things. He also liked a lot of different things like different types of music, architecture, and he liked to have a drink every now and then. In his last year in Michigan, he became the art director and later the managing editor- that's like a boss of the writers- of his school's humor magazine. His work was so good, it was compared to professional work. Then, he went to another school, Yale, to study more about painting and learn about buildings and art history. While still at Yale, he joined the U.S. Army Reserve - that's like being in the army, but you're not full time. He trained at different forts and learned a lot.

Frame construction predominates in the New England area due to the abundance of","completion":"timber resources, traditional building techniques, regional architectural aesthetic, climatic considerations, and relative affordability. These factors have contributed to making frame construction the most preferred and widespread building method in New England. 1. Abundance of Timber Resources: New England has been blessed with ample timber resources due to its vast forests, which contain various species of trees such as oak, maple, pine, and cherry. This profuse availability of wood facilitates the construction of wooden framed homes, as it provides a readily available and local source of building materials. Moreover, the transportation and procurement costs of these wood materials are minimized, contributing to an overall reduction in construction costs. 2. Traditional Building Techniques: Framing construction has historical significance in New England, as it was the initial building method that European settlers introduced in the seventeenth century. Settlers from England had to adapt their traditional timber-framing techniques to accommodate the new and unfamiliar environment, which eventually led to the development of the balloon frame construction. This method uses standardized dimensional lumber and simple tooled connections for ease of construction. Over time, these building techniques have been refined and passed down through generations, creating a strong cultural link between New England's architectural identity and its framing construction heritage. 3. Regional Architectural Aesthetic: New England architecture is characterized by a distinct regional aesthetic that emphasizes simple, functional, and practical structures. Many classic New England homes, such as the Cape Cod, the Colonial, the Saltbox, and the Shingle-style homes, are built using wooden frame construction to provide this traditional and iconic look. Residents of New England often prefer the charm and atmosphere that these wooden structures offer, and this preference continues to drive the demand for frame construction in the region. 4. Climatic Considerations: New England experiences diverse climatic conditions, including hot and humid summers, frigid winters, and heavy snowfalls. Frame construction proves to be advantageous in these weather conditions, as wood is a natural insulator, keeping homes warm during winters and cool during summers. Additionally, wooden structures can easily adapt to the region's local temperature fluctuations by expanding and contracting without causing major structural issues. The resilience of frame construction homes in the face of extreme weather also contributes to their popularity in the region. 5. Relative Affordability: Compared to other construction methods, such as masonry, frame construction tends to be more cost-effective due to the use of standardized materials and established techniques. As mentioned earlier, the local availability of timber resources in New England reduces both material and transportation costs. Furthermore, frame construction's comparatively simple assembly process allows for a shorter construction timeline, which can result in lower labor costs. These financial advantages make framing an attractive choice for many New England homeowners seeking an economical option for their construction projects. In conclusion, frame construction's popularity in New England can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the region's abundant timber resources, traditional building techniques, distinct architectural aesthetic, appropriate climatic considerations, and relative affordability. As a result, frame construction will likely continue to dominate the construction landscape in New England, providing resilient, functional, and charming homes that reflect and sustain the region's unique architectural identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Silver City's producer is Maggie Renzi."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I can use this background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Now, I have a new situation: Two identical chemical compounds are both in beakers on top of burners in a laboratory. Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature.

They feel really good about the parent support, but they realize it's impossible for them to solve this problem. The 22,000-student district discovered the shortage last month. \\" It's extraordinary. Nobody would have imagined something happening like this at this level,\\" said State Treasurer Mike Coffman. Coffman and district officials last week agreed on a state emergency plan freeing up a 9.8 million loan that enabled the payroll to be met for 2,700 teachers and staff in time for the holidays. District officials also took 1.7 million from student -activity accounts of its 38 schools. At Coffman's request, the District Attorney has begun investigating the district's finances. Coffman says he wants to know whether district officials hid the budget shortage until after the November election, when voters approved a 212 million bond issue for schools. In Frederick, students' parents are buying classroom supplies and offering to pay for groceries and utilities to keep first-year teachers and principals in their jobs.

Step 1: Selecting a word for \\"girl\\" First, let's address the term \\"girl.\\" It may seem like an easy task to choose a word, but it's essential to consider the context and tone you want to convey. Many synonyms can work to describe a female, but some may carry age implications, cultural nuances, or simply be more informal. Here are a few options: - Maiden: This word evokes a sense of innocence and youth. - Damsel: Implies a young lady in a somewhat romantic or chivalrous context. - Lady: Conveys a sense of maturity and elegance. - Lass: An informal term for a young girl with a playful and spirited attitude. For the purpose of our phrase, let's choose \\"maiden\\" as our girl synonym, as it captures both youthfulness and innocence. Step 2: Selecting a word for \\"beautiful\\" Next, it's time to pick a word that encapsulates the concept of beauty. Just like selecting the word for girl, there are numerous choices available. We should consider the overall message we want our final phrase to portray.

For our phrase, we'll select \\"enchanting\\" as it adds a touch of mystique and allure to the description of the girl. Step 3: Creating the phrase With our chosen words for \\"girl\\" and \\"beautiful\\" settled, now it's time to form our phrase. Consider the flow and balance of the expression by connecting the two words using adjectives, adverbs, or even poetic devices such as similes or metaphors. Here are some ideas with our selected words \\"maiden\\" and \\"enchanting:\\" - The enchantingly fair maiden - A maiden of enchanting grace - Enchanting beauty in a maiden's guise For our final phrase, let's go with \\"A maiden of enchanting grace.\\" Conclusion Selecting the right words can have a significant impact on the emotion and depth of a phrase or statement. In this article, we carefully picked the words \\"maiden\\" and \\"enchanting\\" and combined them to create \\"A maiden of enchanting grace.\\" This phrase paints a vivid picture, encapsulating the essence of a youthful and beautiful girl while adding a touch of captivating mystique.

Second question: What are some of the biggest mistakes or inconsistencies of all time in well-known movies? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Options are: a). no. b). yes.","completion":"First question: Are tickling and whipping scenes in movies for real? Tickling and whipping scenes in movies are typically staged and choreographed, just like other scenes involving physical contact or violence. They are generally not \\"real\\" in the sense that the actors are not being hurt or made to feel genuinely uncomfortable during the filming. Actors participating in these scenes usually have safety measures and precautions in place to ensure they are not harmed or injured during the process. The intensity of tickling or whipping may be simulated by employing various camera angles, special effects, or post-production editing techniques. Props, such as fake whips, can also be used to avoid causing real pain to the actors involved. Additionally, actors receive training on how to properly and safely execute these scenes, which can involve working with the film's director, stunt coordinators, and other performers. The actors are often required to rehearse extensively to ensure the scene appears realistic while keeping the performers safe. In some cases, a body double or stunt performer may be used for more intense or risky scenes to protect the primary actors from potential harm. In all instances, the primary goal for film production crews is to create believable scenes without causing physical or emotional distress to those involved. Second question: What are some of the biggest mistakes or inconsistencies of all time in well-known movies? Many well-known movies have had their fair share of mistakes or inconsistencies that viewers have noticed over the years. These mistakes can range from simple continuity errors to glaring plot holes. Here are some examples: 1. \\"Jurassic Park\\" (1993) - In one scene, a T-Rex suddenly appears on a flat landscape that later turns into a massive drop, which has raised questions about the geography of the park. 2. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy (2001-2003) - Frodo's sword, Sting, does not glow blue when orcs are nearby in some scenes, which contradicts the sword's established properties and abilities. 3. \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (1994) - A continuity error occurs when bullet holes are visible in a wall behind John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, before a shootout scene takes place. 4. \\"Braveheart\\" (1995) - Historical inaccuracies include the use of kilts, which were not worn until much later, and the portrayal of the Battle of Stirling Bridge without an actual bridge. 5. \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" (1939) - The Scarecrow briefly holds a revolver during the \\"Haunted Forest\\" scene, which is a significant inconsistency in the film as the character suddenly acquires a weapon that never reappears or is mentioned again.

How do I go about creating a database for an e-commerce website using erds? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? OPT: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"(1). No These two questions are inquiring about different information. The first question is about the comfort of underfloor heating systems in a home, while the second question is related to creating a database for an e-commerce website using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs). First Question: Is Underfloor Heating system makes home comfortable? Underfloor heating systems can indeed make a home more comfortable for a variety of reasons. They provide a consistent and uniform heat throughout the living space, making the environment more thermally balanced and eliminating cold spots. Here are some benefits of underfloor heating systems that contribute to this comfort: 1. Even distribution of heat: Unlike traditional radiators, which tend to warm only the area immediately surrounding them, underfloor heating covers the entire floor area. This means that the heat is more evenly distributed, resulting in a more comfortable temperature throughout the room. 2. Improved air quality: Underfloor heating systems radiate heat, which reduces the need for forced air systems that can circulate dust and allergens. Additionally, since the floor itself is warm, it discourages the growth of mold and mildew, which require cool and damp conditions. 3. Silent operation: Unlike traditional heating systems, underfloor heating operates silently, creating a more peaceful and calming atmosphere in the home. 4. Energy efficiency: Since the entire floor area is heated, underfloor heating systems can attain desired temperatures with relatively low water temperatures, making them more energy-efficient compared to traditional radiators. 5. Space-saving: Underfloor heating systems eliminate the need for wall-mounted radiators, providing more space in the room for furniture and other arrangements. Second Question: How do I go about creating a database for an e-commerce website using erds? Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) are a useful tool for designing a database schema based on the relationships between different entities in an e-commerce website. Here's a step-by-step approach to creating a database using ERDs: 1. Identify the entities: Consider all the main components or objects within the e-commerce website, such as customers, products, orders, payment methods, shipping information, and user reviews. These will become your primary entities in the ERD. 2. Determine the attributes: For each entity, identify the relevant attributes or properties. For example, the customer entity may have attributes like customer_id, name, email, phone, and address, whereas the product entity might have product_id, name, description, price, and stock. 3. Establish relationships between entities: Define how the entities are related to one another. For example, a customer may place multiple orders, and each order may have one or more products in it. These relationships allow the database to store and manage complex data. 4. Define keys and constraints: Establish primary keys for each entity to uniquely identify each record. Foreign keys should also be established to enforce referential integrity between related entities. Applying constraints, such as unique constraints, null/not-null, or check constraints, will help ensure data integrity. 5. Construct the ERD: Use software or free online tools to create an ERD, visualizing the entities, attributes, and relationships you have identified. Include any cardinality or ordinality information to specify the nature of the relationships between entities. 6. Refine and review: Double-check your ERD for any errors, inconsistencies, or omissions. Seek input from stakeholders, such as project managers or other developers, to ensure the database meets the requirements of the e-commerce website. 7. Implement the database: Once the ERD is finalized, use it as a blueprint to create the actual database schema, either by using a Database Management System (DBMS) or by manually writing SQL scripts. Considering both questions, it is clear that they inquire about different information.

Does it follow that \\"Bartolomé was not surprised at the turn of events. \\"? Select from the following. (i). yes; (ii). it is not possible to tell; (iii). no;","completion":"(iii). No The statement \\"Bartolomé was not surprised at the turn of events\\" does not follow from the phrase \\"What madness! Now Bartolomé's face expressed shock.\\" The term \\"madness\\" indicates a scenario or event that is extremely chaotic, confusing, or illogical, while the phrase \\"Bartolomé's face expressed shock\\" implies a strong, sudden, and unexpected emotional response. The expression of shock on Bartolomé's face demonstrates that he was indeed taken aback by the events unfolding before him, underscoring that these events were not anticipated or expected by him. In essence, if he was not surprised by the turn of events, his face would most likely display a response other than shock; he might have seemed unbothered, aloof, or even pleased, dependent on his foreknowledge and feelings towards the occurrence. Hence, it does not follow that \\"Bartolomé was not surprised at the turn of events,\\" as the surprise is evident in his shock. The shock expressed on his face contradicts the assertion that he was not surprised, leading us to conclude that the correct answer is (iii) no. Furthermore, such emotional expressions are often associated with a person's innate or spontaneous reaction to an event, especially when it is unexpected or startling. This, combined with the exclamation \\"What madness,\\" further affirms the conclusion that Bartolomé was indeed surprised by the turn of events. This situation presents a clear contradiction to the claim that Bartolomé was not surprised. So, evaluating the information given, the statement that Bartolomé was not surprised at the event doesn't align with the description provided in the narrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography. The Life photo became an \\"era-defining picture\\" and was compared to the photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima.

Carrie had to bring their pet to the vet more often than Erin had to bring theirs because the pet of","completion":"Carrie was a rare, exotic creature that was much more susceptible to health issues and required special care. Despite Erin having a robust Labrador Retriever named Thunder, known for both its intelligence and loyalty, the challenges of Carrie's rare species were far more complicated. Carrie had acquired her pet, Zephyr, a mystifying Capybara-Toucan hybrid, during one of her thrilling expeditions to the Amazon rainforest. Zephyr was a peculiar creature, the size and build of a large house cat but with the distinctive beak and bright plumage of a Toucan, and the temperament and social instincts of a Capybara. The moment she laid eyes on Zephyr, Carrie knew that this enchanting animal with its whimsical demeanor was destined to become her lifelong companion. Erin, on the other hand, had adopted the young Thunder from a local breeder and spent countless hours training and caring for him. As much as he loved spending time with his owner, Thunder preferred to showcase his skills and play with other dogs at the park. While both friends were delighted with their pets, the constant trips to the vet for Zephyr were beginning to wear on Carrie, both emotionally and financially. She knew that finding a qualified vet that could cater to such a unique creature was a rare occurrence, and the medical bills were starting to pile up. Still, Carrie refused to give up on her beloved pet, determined to ensure that Zephyr could lead the most fulfilling life possible. Erin, ever the supportive friend, took notice of Carrie's struggles and decided to help her research potential solutions to Zephyr's health issues. The two scoured the internet and consulted an extensive network of exotic pet groups, hoping to gain insight into the fascinating creature's needs. They soon discovered that Zephyr required a highly specific diet given its two distinctive species characteristics - a mix of fruits, vegetables, and insects to cater to its Toucan side, and a wide variety of aquatic plants and natural materials to satisfy its Capybara instincts. Realizing that her own knowledge was insufficient, Carrie decided to enroll in an online course on exotic pet care, specifically tailored to Capybara-Toucan hybrids like Zephyr. Over time, she amassed an impressive wealth of knowledge, determined to provide Zephyr with the utmost care. Meanwhile, Erin too faced her own set of challenges with Thunder; his boundless energy required hours of daily exercise, plenty of mental stimulation, and a strict grooming routine. Their days became a delicate balance between Erin's work and ensuring Thunder's needs were properly catered to. As months rolled by, Carrie's dedication to Zephyr's care began to pay off. The frequency of their visits to the vet decreased, and Zephyr's health and vigor improved significantly. Erin took pride in her friend's achievements and noticed the positive changes in Thunder’s life as well. The once-intimidating balancing act of pet care now came as second nature to the duo. As Carrie and Erin strolled through the park with Zephyr and Thunder in tow, they couldn't help but feel a deep, unwavering bond with their pets. Amid the rigors of daily life and all the challenges that accompanied their unique companions, they knew that every effort they put into caring for their pets had been worth it. The unconditional love that welled within their hearts was a testament to the resilience and strength of the human-animal connection, and the beautiful, ever-changing journey that unfolded when choosing to love and protect the creatures that shared their world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: How can a molecule containing just 4 different nucleotides specify the sequence of the 20 amino acids that occur in proteins? If each nucleotide coded for 1 amino acid, then obviously the nucleic acids could code for only 4 amino acids. What if amino acids were coded for by groups of 2 nucleotides? There are 42, or 16, different combinations of 2 nucleotides (AA, AU, AC, AG, UU, and so on). Such a code is more extensive but still not adequate to code for 20 amino acids. However, if the nucleotides are arranged in groups of 3, the number of different possible combinations is 43, or 64. Here we have a code that is extensive enough to direct the synthesis of the primary structure of a protein molecule. The genetic code can therefore be described as the identification of each group of three nucleotides and its particular amino acid. The sequence of these triplet groups in the mRNA dictates the sequence of the amino acids in the protein. Each individual three-nucleotide coding unit, as we have seen, is called a codon. Protein synthesis is accomplished by orderly interactions between mRNA and the other ribonucleic acids (transfer RNA [tRNA] and ribosomal RNA [rRNA]), the ribosome, and more than 100 enzymes. The mRNA formed in the nucleus during transcription is transported across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm to the ribosomes—carrying with it the genetic instructions. The process in which the information encoded in the mRNA is used to direct the sequencing of amino acids and thus ultimately to synthesize a protein is referred to as translation. Before an amino acid can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain, it must be attached to its unique tRNA. This crucial process requires an enzyme known as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (Figure 19.12 \\"Binding of an Amino Acid to Its tRNA\\"). There is a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for each amino acid. This high degree of specificity is vital to the incorporation of the correct amino acid into a protein. After the amino acid molecule has been bound to its tRNA... Q: After the amino acid molecule has been bound to its what, protein synthesis can take place?

Choices: *yes. *it is not possible to tell. *no.","completion":"If Sentence 1 is true, then it is not possible to tell if Sentence 2 is also true. Here's why: Sentence 1 asserts that people may be too shortsighted in their saving decisions to consider the potential impact of current government debt on future generations. This statement implies that not enough focus may be given to the consequences of accumulating government debt. It is important to note the use of the word \\"may\\" in this sentence; it indicates a possibility rather than certainty. Sentence 2 claims that future generations will face the worst economic situations ever due to a lack of foresight today. This statement is much stronger and more absolute than the first one, as it predicts a definite outcome for future generations. While both sentences express concerns about the potential negative effects of shortsighted saving decisions and government debt on future generations, they differ in the level of certainty they convey. Sentence 1 presents a possibility, while Sentence 2 asserts a prediction. To determine if both statements are true, we would need additional information and evidence to support the claim made in Sentence 2. It is possible that the level of government debt may lead to worse economic situations in the future, but it is also conceivable that other factors, such as advances in technology, policy changes, or economic growth, could mitigate the negative impacts of the debt.

The course is one of the most popular in the prison. Prisoners have to earn the right to attend the course and they work hard to get in. One reason why the course is so popular is that many prisoners find it easier to connect with animals than with people, because animals don't judge them. They trust animals in ways they don't with humans. Yet, they hold a misunderstanding of how animals treat one another. Many admit that their own \\"animal behavior\\" is what got them into trouble in the first place. I teach that though there is competition and aggression in the animal kingdom, there is also a lot of cooperation and sympathy. Many of the students want to build healthy relationships, and they find that the class helps them. I use examples of the social behavior of group-living animals such as wolves as a model for developing and maintaining friendships among people who must work together for their own good and also for the good of the group. It's clear that science inspires the students here and it also gives them hope. I know some students have gone back into education after their being set free while others have gone to work for humane societies or contributed time and money to conservation organizations. One went on to receive a master's degree in nature writing. Science and humane education help the prisoners connect with values that they otherwise would not have done. It opens the door to understanding, trust, cooperation and hope. There's a large population of people to whom science could mean a lot, if only they could have access to it. The class helps me, too. I get as much out of it as the students and it has made me a better teacher.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What group's television debut came on the news show People and Places? Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, \\"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ...\\" Lennon said: \\"We used to dress how we...

Andy Prowting died on Wednesday, eight months after noticing a mole on his back. A man who developed skin cancer after getting sunburnt in Turkey has died - just 18 months after returning from his holiday. Andy Prowting noticed a large, brown mole appear on his back six months after the trip to Turkey last July. Tests found it was cancerous and the 24-year-old from Havant, Hampshire, had the mole removed in April this year. But in August, he learned the cancer had spread to his bones and liver - leaving him with only around nine months to live. With no treatment available in the UK, Mr Prowting's family and friends rallied together to create a fundraising group. They hoped to raise £60,000 to fund potentially life-saving treatment at a clinic in Houston, Texas, and collected £45,000 over a five-week period from August. But before he could travel to the U.S., Mr Prowting lost his battle, passing away on Wednesday night - just four months after receiving his terminal diagnosis. Last night, writing on Andy's Army Facebook page, his mother Julie Williams said: 'This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do. 'I am devastated to inform you all of Andy's passing. 'He is free from pain now. I am so heartbroken, he was my life. I will love you forever Andy.' Friends and family have since paid tribute. Nicola Dolphin wrote: 'RIP Andy. You always had a smile on your face even through the toughest times.' Karen Fuller added: 'Andy was so strong all throughout his illness and always showed his lovely smile. Heaven has gained one in a million. 'Andy will be missed by many. I will hold all my lovely memories of Andy close too my heart. 'Still hard to believe he's flying high with those angels.' In September, Andy spoke about his diagnosis. He said: 'I was in Turkey last July and even though I was applying sunscreen every hour, I got burnt,' he said. 'In January I felt something on my back and got my mum to check. July 2013: Mr Prowting goes on holiday to Turkey, where he suffers bad sunburn, despite using sunscreen.

December 10, 2014: Mr Prowting dies. 'There was a mole and we kept checking it and noticed it was growing a lot and I went to see my doctor.' After being referred to a dermatology centre, the security guard was diagnosed with malignant melanoma. Surgeons removed the mass as well as lymph nodes under his right arm and tissue from his back at Portsmouth's Queen Alexandra Hospital in April as part of an aggressive course of treatment. After three months off work to recover, he was referred to Southampton General Hospital, to take part in a chemotherapy trial in August. But when doctors ran tests, they found the cancer had spread to Mr Prowting's bones and liver. As his was a rare secondary form, neither hospital could treat it. It was then the 24-year-old and his family learned about a clinic in Houston, Texas, which offers treatment to stop the growth and spread of cancer. It accepted the chance to treat him after reviewing his medical notes. But the family needed to raise £60,000 for the treatment. Friends, family and strangers organised fundraising events and took part in sponsored activities to raise more than £45,000. The money raised will now go to the teenager and young adult cancer unit at Southampton General Hospital in Southampton. Scroll down for video.

After having it surgically removed, he learned he had just months to live as the cancer had spread through his body. Mr Prowting with his fiance Sarah Barclay. The couple got engaged after re-kindling their relationship, just a month before Mr Prowting passed away. Last night, Andy's devastated mother broke the tragic news of his death on Facebook. Skin cancer is among the most common forms of the disease in the world, affecting hundreds of thousands of people in the UK every year. There are different types of skin cancer - non-melanoma and melanoma diseases. Melanoma - which Mr Prowting has been afflicted by - is a serious and fast spreading disease. Beginning in the skin, it spreads through the body and contaminates inner organs. The most common symptom of this form of cancer is a new mole, most frequently appearing on the back, arms and legs, or changes to an existing mole. These types of moles are often itchy and bleeding and may larger than the norm. NHS Choices has devised an ABCDE checklist to distinguish between melanoma moles and ordinary blemishes:. Applying sunscreen and wearing sensible clothing in the sun is recommended to avoid skin cancer. The more moles a person has on their body, the higher your risk of melanoma. It doesn't guarantee a person will definitely get melanoma, but it means a person should take greater care in the sun. The larger a mole, the higher the risk of melanoma. A large mole is one greater than 5mm in diameter. People with just one unusually shaped or very large mole, have a 60 per cent increased risk of melanoma. Non-melanoma cancers refer to a group of cancers which slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin. While not all forms are preventable, it is possible to lower the chance of non-melanoma cancers in a number of ways. Applying sun screen and dressing sensibly while in the sun is advisable as is avoiding sunbeds or sunlamps which emit UV rays. Exposure to UV rays is thought to be one of the biggest triggers for skin cancer, though family history, fair complexion and having lots of moles or freckles also increase a person's chance of developing it.

As the credits continue, voices and clanking sounds are heard. One says \\"Camera - rolling!\\" and another follows with \\"Group 36 Training Film.\\" After some more fumbling sounds, the training film begins. A crude map of Berlin in 1987 appears, filmed by an unsteady camera. A narrator, one of the previously heard voices, explains that Allied occupation forces rule the city, and almost every squat has been evacuated. Only one block remains: Machnow Street, zip code SO36, in the American sector. The film then gives way to footage of a crowd of jeering people in a run-down neighborhood. They begin to throw objects at a line of police holding riot shields. For a moment, the camera freezes, and the film's title, \\"Was Tun, Wenn's Brennt?\\" (What to Do in Case of Fire?) appears on the screen. Then the rioters rush the line of policemen, jumping on cars, screaming, and generally causing mayhem. The camera focuses on some of the rioters, whose names appear onscreen, introducing Tim (Til Schweiger) and Flo (Doris Schretzmayer). A water cannon, a huge, tank-like vehicle equipped with a high-pressure water hose, begins to rumble down the street. Its spray knocks down several rioters, and they begin to flee. Rioters with signs continue to mock the policemen. Two more new characters appear in the same way as the others, Maik (Sebastian Blomberg) and Nele (Nadja Uhl). Another, Terror (Matthias Matschke) urinates on the policemen from an upper-story window. Yet another, Hotte (Martin Feifel), leads a mob down a street, waving a flag bearing the symbol for anarchy. All the while, the rioters are heard shouting in the streets. The narrator begins to speak again, informing viewers that Machnow street residents live in terrible conditions. A female voice adds that they are always inebriated or on drugs. More voices chime in that these people commit vandalism, resist arrest, and are misguided and sexually... Answer:","completion":"Given the movie plot predominantly revolves around squatters living in Berlin during the late 1980s, dealing with the police and the rough city life, a potential title could be \\"Squatters of SO36: Anatomy of Anarchy.\\" This title reflects not only the geographical location, but also the pervasive themes of social strife, rebellion, and anarchism which appear to be key elements in the plot. Moreover, the use of the term 'Anatomy' suggests a deep exploration or dissection of these themes. The title thus provides potential viewers with an insight into the subject matter of the movie, indicating it's likely to be a social drama or a treatise on anarchy being played out in a specific time and place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some of the film is very haunting, like Annabelle's \\"You can never come come back\\", which kind of scares me still. Unfortunately, there were some bits I didn't like so much. The story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem. Also there were some dark scenes, that young children would find upsetting, but the ending is very poignant. However the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung. None of them in particular stick out, with exception of \\"Let's Make Music Together\\" and \\"Love Survives\\", and Burt Reynolds can't sing and Dom DeLuise has done much better singing. All in all, a watchable movie, that could have been more, but is definitely memorable, and I would definitely watch it again. 7/10.

Bono's wealth soared today as Facebook floated on the stock exchange - boosting his stunning portfolio which includes properties, shares and even a Broadway show. The Irish rocker's investment company Elevation Partners holds a 2.3 per cent stake in the social networking site which is now worth in excess of 1.5billion. The company paid 90million for the shares in 2009 but they have rocketed in value. Elevation: The IPO will make Bono the richest pop star in the world. But the move to place Facebook on the stock market has has evoked almost as many shivers of fear in the business world as it has gasps of excitement. Today, as Facebook launched on the Nasdaq stock exchange with a valuation of 104billion, it made more than 1,000 new millionaires - and investors such as Bono even richer. It is a staggering market value - bigger than US manufacturing giants Ford and Boeing combined, and all the more incredible given that the site currently earns a fraction of what those ‘old world’ companies do. There are nine other directors of Elevation Partners and it is thought that Bono owns a little over 10 per cent of the 1.5billion stake. His band U2 are already worth 813million according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Although today will be a beautiful day for Bono, it is unclear exactly how much he is personally worth. Wealth: Bono's house in Killiney, Ireland, which had its roof removed to add a second floor and new roof terraces. He owns a number of other properties around the world. His investment company Elevation Partners, named after a U2 song, was set up in 2004 with five former senior figures from the world of business, including the former chief financial officer of Apple Computers. On top of his pot of social networking gold, Bono holds a portfolio of properties, cars and other investments. Although his investment company has seen their Facebook shares soar in value, the luck of the Irish deserted Bono when the group injected cash into smartphone manufacturer Palm in 2007. Elevation invested 480m in the firm, only to see Apple’s iPhone take the market by storm and bring Palm to its knees. They did get their money back, however, when Hewlett-Packard snapped up Palm on the cheap, as Elevation had ring-fenced their investment with a clause that guaranteed reimbursement if it was sold. French bolthole: A coastal property Bono owns in Eze-sur-Mer, France, along with other homes in Ireland and New York. Bono’s investments then got tangled in the sticky web of the Broadway Spider-Man musical, which was panned by the critics and plagued by a series of accidents. It is understood U2 invested 65million in it, which some might say was sheer folly. Though in the long run, now that the show is up and running smoothly, it could well be a money spinner. It’s not likely that Bono lost an awful lot of sleep over his investments anyway, since the money he’s made from performing is vast. Beyond his complex financial interests, the rocker has a property portfolio that includes a villa in the Southof France and a lavish Italian-style palazzo overlooking the seanear Dublin, not to mention the £15million penthouse onManhattan's Upper West side he bought from Apple founder SteveJobs. Facebook launch: Mark Zuckerberg (centre) remotely rings the Nasdaq bell as Facebook is launched on the Nasdaq stock exchange creating 1,000 new millionaires - and making Bono even richer. Lack of respect: Zuckerberg is known to turn up to meetings with investors wearing a hoody and jeans. The apartment, which takes up two floors of the 27-storey northtower of the ultra-exclusive San Remo building, is listed as one ofNew York's top 40 properties and boasts 12ft nickel and bronzedoors and floor-to-ceiling windows costing £40,000 each. The building, which is also home to Steven Spielberg, is soselect that its management committee once blackballed Madonna'sattempts to move in. Having said that, those who have visited describe Bono'sapartment, with its avant-garde stone walls and floors, as'charmless and stark'. Despite its huge sun terrace with stunning views of CentralPark, one visitor commented: 'It has absolutely no warmth.' Meanwhile, on top of his own lavish property in the upmarketKilliney district of Dublin - which he shares with his wife Ali and four children. When he decided it wasn't big enough, the star paid £3million eight years ago to buy a neighbour's house and linked the two with a corridor. Bono, whose real name is Paul Hewson, also counts a family-sizedMaserati among his fleet of luxury cars and is known for his tastefor fine food. He is also a noted wine connoisseur, who willregularly spend thousands on a single bottle at his favourite NewYork restaurants. He and the three other members of U2, Adam Clayton, Larry Mullenand guitarist David 'The Edge' Evans, also invested in Vertigo3, an Airbus A320, to fly them around in style. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article is primarily focused on the U2 frontman, Bono, and his diverse investment portfolio, majorly highlighted by his stake in the social network site Facebook. In 2012, Facebook's decision to go public notably increased Bono's wealth due to his 2.3 per cent stake in the company through his investment firm Elevation Partners. At that time, this stake was valued over 1.5 billion. Elevation Partners had initially purchased Facebook shares in 2009 for a payment of 90 million. This substantial increase in value has led to Bono becoming the wealthiest pop star in the world at the time. This staggering spike in wealth is further compounded by the band U2's net worth of 813 million. But Bono's individual wealth was not clear at the time of the news publication. Despite Elevation Partners' noteworthy success with Facebook's shares, not all of Bono's investments fetched him windfall profits. The group lost considerably when they invested 480 million in smartphone manufacturer Palm in 2007, which tumbled due to the iPhone's market dominance. However, they managed to recover their investment when Hewlett-Packard acquired Palm. Another investment that met initial criticism was U2's 65 million stake in the troubled Broadway production of Spider-Man, yet the perspectives were optimistic as the musical's operational troubles started to smooth out. Besides his investments, Bono's wealth also comes from a diverse property portfolio including a villa in the South of France, a lavish Italian-style palazzo in Dublin, and a £15 million penthouse on Manhattan's Upper West side, previously owned by Apple's founder, Steve Jobs. His place in Dublin, which he shares with his wife Ali and four children, was expanded by acquiring a neighbour's house. Furthermore, Bono has a taste for luxury, owning a family-sized Maserati and enjoying fine dining and wine. Bono along with U2 peers—Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen and guitarist David 'The Edge' Evans—also invested in Vertigo3, an Airbus A320, for their transportation needs. So, in essence, this article underscores Bono's financial success primarily through a smart investment in Facebook, his diversified property portfolio, and his lifestyle characteristics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. RICK PERRY, R - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is a powerful moment in America's history and you are on the front lines. NEWT GINGRICH, R - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to do well enough to clearly be in the competition, and I think that it's very possible that the top four are going to be very, very close by this evening. MITT ROMNEY, R - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's all tied up, so you know, so we'll see what happens, but at this stage, you know, I think I'll be one of the three. RON PAUL, R - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The change is not complicated. The change is just restoring what was, those principles that made America great. MICHELE BACHMANN, R - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've bought our tickets already for South Carolina. We're going, we're moving forward. RICK SANTORUM, R - PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've got a good team we're going to expand it in Florida we're adding staff in Florida and other places. BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Alright, some of the sights and sounds from candidates making their final pitches. Some counties are particularly interesting tonight because of the past history. Six of them individually will be watching the results to see if we can tell where it goes, Dallas County, Dubuque County -- Dubuque is actually heavily catholic, pro-life, Senator Santorum expected to do well there and that race against Romney in that county, it'll be interesting, Johnson County, home of University of Iowa, this is a big county for Ron Paul, if he's to win, Polk County, Sioux County and Woodbury County. And in Woodbury, a lot of people comparing what happened four years ago with Mitt Romney and his votes in those. You see how it's spread across the state. Jeff, when you look at all of these different places you see the comparison to what Romney got vote-wise back in 2008. A lot of people will be looking at just that, to see how he's doing stacking up. JEFF ZELENY, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK TIMES: Exactly, and the one big ditches between now a Polk County in Des Moines and all of central Iowa. He did very poorly four years ago, largely because of a conservative radio host who no longer works on the biggest radio station in the state who relentlessly attacked Mitt Romney's conservative credentials four years ago. That has not happened. So, he believes that Polk County is a strength for him this time. So I would say for Governor Romney that's the biggest difference. And he still, he wrapped up his campaign in the eastern part of the state yesterday where there's a lot of Republicans along the Mississippi River, so his campaign is pretty confident of a strong showing in that part of the state. BAIER: Steve, what about the tickets out? We hear the three tickets out, the governor said it today, others have said it, but, boy, those other campaigns are really making a case that South Carolina is the be all end all. STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I think it's hard to say that there will be three tickets out. You have Newt Gingrich who clearly wants to continue even if he comes in fourth or fifth in part because he's so angry about what Mitt Romney has done to him and Ron Paul to a lesser extent. And it sounds like he wants to carry out what could be a campaign of vengeance even if he doesn't do well here. Rick Perry, I think there are real questions about how much of the money that he raised, that eye popping last quarter, how much of that is still remaining and available to him. He's done a lot of ads, he's done a lot of production here and purchased some ads in South Carolina, and that indicates that he's clearly going to South Carolina. I'm told he has a good ground game there. So I think he's likely to end up going to South Carolina. But what was interesting, I talked to a senior South Carolina Republican Party official today and asked, you know, what does the ground game look like for the people coming out of here. And he said that the candidate that has been to South Carolina more than any other candidate is Rick Santorum. Which was surprising, somewhere between 26 and 28 appearances. So he may actually have, his argument has been, he made it on \\"Center Seat\\" with us, he's trying to set up a campaign that if he catches fire the days before the Iowa caucuses allows him to continue to go, and he may be able to take advantage of that. BAIER: Ya know and Kirsten, a lot of people say, well he just doesn't have the money, even if the money was coming in, it wouldn't come fast enough. But with the advent of super PACs, big money supporters could help a Santorum campaign continue on if he's the chosen conservative alternative? KIRSTEN POWERS, COLUMNIST, NEW YORK POST: Yeah, I mean, look, if he won in Iowa that would be a huge boon. And, yes, people could decide that he is -- if he wins it will mean probably that he got the evangelicals and social conservatives to rally around him, which makes him the anti-Romney. And there are a lot of people who want to support an anti-Romney. If they decide that he can actually go the distance, a lot of people would step up. But that's the issue. I think that most people if they look at the polls, they say Romney is the most electable. We don't love him, but he's the most electable. BAIER: Jeff, we've learned that Governor Perry's campaign is buying ad time in South Carolina, so before you find out where he is here, they're planning ahead. Michele Bachmann says she has tickets to South Carolina. There's debates this weekend. I mean, even if someone performs really poorly, they're likely not going to get out right away, right? ZELENY: I think that's right. If we're going to see the same thing that happened at the beginning of the campaign, all of these debates are still going to allow a venue for these candidates to air their points of view. And there's a debate on Saturday, again on Sunday. I think, after New Hampshire it might be a little bit more difficult to sort of go the distance here, but I don't think that the old adage of three tickets out of Iowa is true this year. HAYES: I definitely agree with that. You know what's interesting is will we see New Hampshire be less important this year than it has in other years. Mitt Romney in some of the polls have 30 point leads. He's going to be spending some time in South Carolina, not as much time in New Hampshire. Other candidates are going to New Hampshire but with the expectation that Romney is going to win and win so big, and that there could be a real scrum in South Carolina featuring the winner from here, potentially some of these other candidates, will South Carolina almost displace New Hampshire as the real determinative of who is going to be the nominee? BAIER: And coming out of here there could be multiple storylines, not just the winner, but second and third. It often happens, so it will be interesting. I'm not going to force predictions just because people are sick of predictions. BAIER: We're going to let them vote. Thank you very much. That's it for the panel and we'll talk about what is coming up later tonight after this break. Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Question: Here's a question: At the end of your meal what will a waiter do? Here are possible answers to this question: - serve food - eat - set table - serve meal - present bill I believe the correct choice is \\"present bill\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice indeed is \\"present bill\\". This is because the process of dining at a restaurant follows a certain standard protocol which is more or less the same around the world. When you arrive at a restaurant, the first thing that happens is a host or hostess will greet you and guide you to your table. The waiter then comes to your table to take your order. Depending on the type of restaurant you are dining at, you may first order drinks and appetizers, followed by the main course, and finally, if you wish, desserts and coffee. Throughout your meal, the waiter will check in on you from time to time to make sure everything is to your satisfaction. They ensure that you have everything you need - that your glasses are filled, your table is clean and tidy, and any other requests you make are fulfilled in a timely manner. However, upon the completion of a meal at a restaurant, while you are still at your table, a common universal practice is that the waiter will present you with the bill. This is the final stage of the dining experience, following consumption of food and drinks. The purpose of presenting the bill is to inform you of the total amount owed for the food and services provided by the restaurant. This bill represents the cost of the items ordered, including any beverages and other services. This bill may also include other charges such as taxes and service charges, depending on the specific policies and practices of the establishment. After you review the bill and confirm the charges, you will then proceed with payment, which can usually be done with cash or credit card. In contrast, the other options presented: serve food, eat, set the table, and serve meal, are tasks that would have already been completed by this stage in your dining experience. Therefore, they do not accurately represent the action a waiter would take at the end of your meal. The option \\"eat\\" is also incorrect because it pertains to the actions of the customers themselves. While a waiter might eat during their break time, it is not part of their service duties, especially not towards the end of a customer's meal. Therefore, given these reasons, \\"present bill\\" fits the context of the action a waiter will take at the end of your meal. It's the final step of service in the restaurant experience and concludes the dining process before a customer leaves out of the establishment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During the Silurian, Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an unconformity.

The next evening the young Hardys again took their seats by Seth, and, without any delay, he went on with his story. \\"After El Zeres had ridden off, the lieutenant, Pedro, selected ten from the men around--for pretty well the whole camp had gathered round us--and told them, in the first place, to clear the house of the hammock and other belongings of El Zeres, and when this was done to carry Rube in. Bound and helpless as he was, there was a visible repugnance on the part of the men to touch him, so great was the fear which his tremendous strength had excited. However, six of them took him up and carried him into the hut--for it was little more--and threw him down like a log in the inner room. I walked in of my own accord, and sat down on the ground near him. I heard Pedro give orders to some of the men outside to take away the dead bodies and bury them, and for the rest to go down to their campfires. Then he entered the house with his other four men. \\"The house was just the ordinary Mexican hut. It contained two rooms, or rather, one room partially divided into two, the inner compartment forming the sleeping-room of the family. There was no door between the rooms, nor was there any window; the light entering through the wide opening into the outer room. The outer room had no regular windows, only some chinks or loopholes, through which a certain amount of light could come; but these were stopped up with straw, for the Mexicans are a chilly people; and as the door was always open, plenty of light came in through it.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Out of boredom, two scientists from the New Contagious Diseases Research Centre devised themselves a new game. One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.

Answer:","completion":"The smoke of the incense filled the whole room and started to choke people because the concentration of the smoke was far too abundant for the small, poorly ventilated space, causing an uneasy and suffocating atmosphere that was difficult to bear for the unfortunate occupants. This situation could have been alleviated by either decreasing the amount of incense used or by increasing ventilation throughout the room, but as it stood, the discomfort was a direct result of the overwhelming presence of the incense smoke. The room itself may have been appropriately sized for social gatherings or other purposes, but the introduction of an excessive volume of incense smoke proved to be overpowering, ultimately detracting from the experience and causing distress to those present. In the future, it would be wise to carefully consider the balance between creating an atmosphere with sensory elements such as incense, and maintaining a comfortable, breathable environment for people to enjoy. By doing so, one could avoid inadvertently turning a pleasant atmosphere into one of unease and discomfort, allowing guests to focus on their interactions with one another rather than being preoccupied with the unintended negative consequences of an overly smoky room."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this structure, the narrative emphasizes the location within Placerville before expanding out to its wider location. On the other hand, the second sentence, 'Missouri House is a former settlement and stopping place in El Dorado County, California, located below Placerville.', puts the emphasis on the larger location first by stating that Missouri House is in El Dorado County and then specifying where within that county it can be found (below Placerville).

Movie title: Night of the Demons Movie plot: The film opens in 1925, with scenes of gore and demons. Evangeline Broussard prepares to hang herself from her balcony when she is stopped by a man trying to reassure her that he is truly Louis and that she shouldn't hang herself. Evangeline calls him a liar, then jumps, hanging herself -- and also causing her head to rip off and bounce down the stairs. Louis stares over the balcony...as his eyes switch to a demonic shade of orange. Cut to present day: a girl named Maddie goes to a party held by Angela Feld with her friends Lily and Suzanne. She realizes her ex-boyfriend Colin is there, dealing drugs. Also there is Lily's ex-boyfriend Dex and his friend Jason. At the party, Angela prompts everyone to go wild, as she must make money off the party or she will have to live on the streets. Lily and Dex eventually reunite, while Suzanne becomes incredibly drunk. Maddie goes to the toilet, only to have a hand grab her through the mirror. They pass it off as an elaborate trick placed by Angela. Police break up the party. Panicked, Colin stuffs his drugs into a grate to hide it from the police before leaving. Maddie, Lily, Dex and Jason leave with the rest, leaving an upset Angela alone in the house. After a while, the group returns, unable to find Suzanne, who is revealed to have passed out. Colin returns for his drugs and, with Angela, goes into the basement to find them. The pair find a hidden door, and Angela remarks that the house is full of hidden rooms, including a tunnel that leads to the next estate over. They enter the room and find six skeletons. Angela surmises that the skeletons are the remains of the missing party guests of Evangeline Broussard. One of the skeletons bites Angela's hand, which causes her to feel woozy. Colin attempts to leave the house, only to discover that the gate is locked and can't be opened. While everyone plans to wait the night out, Suzanne details how Evangeline supposedly practiced black magic in the hopes that she would attract the attention of Louis, only to have that magic...

Madrasa (Arabic: مدرسة‎, madrasah, pl. مدارس, madāris, Turkish: Medrese) is the Arabic word for any type of educational institution, whether secular or religious (of any religion). The word is variously transliterated madrasah, madarasaa, medresa, madrassa, madraza, medrese, etc. In the West, the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the Islamic religion, though this may not be the only subject studied. Not all students in madaris are Muslims; there is also a modern curriculum. The word madrasah derives from the triconsonantal Semitic root د-ر-س D-R-S 'to learn, study', through the wazn (form/stem) مفعل(ة)‎; mafʻal(ah), meaning \\"a place where something is done\\". Therefore, madrasah literally means \\"a place where learning and studying take place\\". The word is also present as a loanword with the same innocuous meaning in many Arabic-influenced languages, such as: Urdu, Bengali, Hindi, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Malay and Bosnian / Croatian. In the Arabic language, the word مدرسة madrasah simply means the same as school does in the English language, whether that is private, public or parochial school, as well as for any primary or secondary school whether Muslim, non-Muslim, or secular. Unlike the use of the word school in British English, the word madrasah more closely resembles the term school in American English, in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school. For example, in the Ottoman Empire during the Early Modern Period, madaris had lower schools and specialised schools where the students became known as danişmends. The usual Arabic word for a university, however, is جامعة (jāmiʻah). The Hebrew cognate midrasha also connotes the meaning of a place of learning; the related term midrash literally refers to study or learning, but has acquired mystical and religious connotations. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. what is the article mainly about? 2. what does the word literally mean? 3. can it be private school? 4. what language does it come from? 5. are all students in madaris Muslim? 6. is it generally considered a religious school in the west? 7. what levels of school does it cover? 8. what is the Arabic word for University? 9. is modern curriculum offered in madrasa? 10. what are some Arabic languages that are mentioned?

While digital streaming platforms offer the convenience of on-demand music, there is something undeniably charming about the warmth and distinctiveness of vinyl. As you embark on your journey to create the perfect vinyl collection, it is essential to start with a thought-out plan and a tailored shopping list. This article will help guide you through the process of building your collection by discussing the importance of controlling your purchases and considering the size of the album. Step One: Curating a Shopping List The first step in building your vinyl collection is to curate a shopping list that includes your must-have albums, as well as some lesser-known gems that you're excited to discover. Consider your musical tastes, favorite genres, and iconic artists to help narrow down your selections. Your shopping list should be a mix of essential albums, undiscovered treasures, and albums that hold personal meaning to you, such as the soundtrack to a memorable moment in your life. By carefully choosing your starting point, you will create a strong foundation for your collection and ensure that it reflects not only your musical preferences but also your personality. Step Two: Limit Your Initial Purchases While it may be tempting to buy every fascinating album you come across, intentionally limiting your initial purchases will help maintain your focus and prevent impulse buys or feelings of being overwhelmed. As a new collector, it is vital to approach your collection with purpose, taking the time to research, listen, and thoughtfully select each record. By starting small, you'll have the opportunity to learn about the different aspects of vinyl collecting, such as proper storage, cleaning, and playback techniques. As your knowledge and experience grow, you can slowly expand your collection and delve deeper into the world of vinyl. Step Three: Consider the Size of the Album An often-overlooked factor when building a vinyl collection is the physical size of the albums. Vinyl records come in various sizes, with the most common being 12-inch LPs (long-playing records) and 7-inch singles. Depending on your storage situation and space, you may need to consider factors such as album size, weight, and thickness. By keeping the size of the album in mind, you can ensure that your collection will be easy to manage, display, and protect. If you have limited space, start by focusing on a select number of records that hold the most importance to you. As your space and budget allow, you can gradually add more albums to your collection. Conclusion: Building a vinyl collection is an incredibly rewarding and personal experience that allows you to connect with your favorite music on a deeper level. By creating a shopping list, limiting your initial purchases, and considering the size of the album, you can thoughtfully build a record collection that reflects your musical journey and creates lasting memories. As you become more knowledgeable and experienced in the world of vinyl, your collection will undoubtedly grow and evolve, providing you with countless hours of musical enjoyment and a tangible piece of history.

(CNN) -- The most difficult decision a member of Congress will ever have to make is to commit our nation's armed forces to military action against an enemy. Having served with and cared for those brave men and women as a physician in the Army Reserve with three deployments including Iraq, this is not a decision I would arrive at lightly or without careful consideration of all the available facts. There is no question that the horrific atrocities perpetrated by Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria are nothing short of appalling and deserve international condemnation. But there is a glaring lack of international resolve on what the response to such abominable acts should be. As the situation evolves, we may see evidence that the OPTIONS: - Afghanistan armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - Army Reserve armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - Bashar al-Assad armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - CNN armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - Congress armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - Heck armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - Iraq armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - Joe Heck armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - Libya armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - Syria armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - U.S. armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - World armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. - al-Assad armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce.","completion":"Bashar al-Assad's armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce. In such a situation, we must carefully evaluate the potential consequences of a military intervention in Syria. First and foremost, we ought to consider the humanitarian crisis that has developed as a result of the ongoing war. While the atrocities committed by the Assad regime are appalling, we must weigh the potential benefits of intervention against the risks of further destabilization and escalation of violence in the region. The memories of previous military interventions in Iraq and Libya, which led to long-lasting conflicts and the rise of hostile groups, serve as cautionary examples of the dangers inherent in such actions. Furthermore, the international community's stance on the appropriate response to the Syrian crisis remains divided, with countries such as Russia and Iran continuing to support the Assad regime. Military intervention without a unified global consensus could accentuate international tensions and potentially lead to a larger-scale conflict with the potential to impact not just Syria, but the entire Middle East and possibly other regions. Moreover, the complexity of the situation in Syria, with multiple factions vying for control, makes it nearly impossible to predict the ultimate outcome of a military intervention. The possibility of inadvertently empowering extremist groups or fostering power vacuums is a genuine concern that cannot be entirely ruled out. Rather than rushing into a decision that could have unintended and far-reaching repercussions, the U.S. should instead continue to explore diplomatic avenues for resolving the conflict. Encouraging dialogues and negotiations between the opposing factions and international stakeholders could pave the way for a more stable and lasting solution. In addition to diplomatic efforts, the U.S. and other nations can also provide support in addressing the devastating humanitarian consequences of the conflict. Assisting with the resettlement of refugees, providing medical aid, and working to rebuild infrastructure in war-torn regions can help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and lay the groundwork for a better future for them. Ultimately, it is crucial for Congress to approach the situation in Syria with prudence and caution, remaining aware of the potential ramifications of military intervention. By considering all available options and engaging in concerted international efforts, the U.S. can play a vital role in the pursuit of a peaceful, stable, and secure future for Syria and the wider region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They have distinct meanings and require different approaches in answering them. Let's break down each question to provide a more detailed and comprehensive response. 1. How do I get a girl to propose to me? Generally, it's more common for men to propose to women. However, getting a woman to propose to you is not impossible. Here's a step-by-step guide to increase the chances of that happening: Step 1: Develop a strong connection Build a deep emotional bond with your partner. Share your thoughts, feelings, and experiences while actively listening to her. Trust, respect, and understanding are indispensable in fostering a healthy relationship. Step 2: Create a supportive atmosphere Be supportive and encouraging towards your partner in her personal and professional pursuits. Encouraging and trusting her will show that you are genuinely interested in her well-being and happiness. Step 3: Showcase your commitment Demonstrate commitment to the relationship by being there for her during the good times and the bad. Show her that you're willing to overcome challenges and work together towards shared goals. Step 4: Communicate openly about marriage Discuss your thoughts about marriage and the future openly. Make sure you're both on the same page about your relationship goals. Step 5: Encourage her assertiveness Empower her to express her feelings and assert herself in the relationship. Enable her to feel confident and secure in taking the lead. Step 6: Create an environment of equality Treat your partner as an equal in every aspect of your relationship. Share responsibilities and decision-making, and give her room to take the lead on certain issues. Step 7: Be patient Give it time. Be patient and let the relationship evolve, allowing her to become comfortable and confident enough to propose when she's ready. 2. How do I propose to a girl? Proposing to a girl is a significant step in a relationship, so it's crucial to ensure that you do it right. Here's a step-by-step guide to proposing to a girl: Step 1: Be sure about your feelings Make sure that you're genuinely in love with the person you're proposing to, and that you're ready for a lifelong commitment. Step 2: Gauge her feelings Ensure that she feels the same way about you and that you both share common values, goals, and expectations for the future. Step 3: Discuss the concept of marriage Talk openly about your thoughts on marriage and your future together. Ensure that both of you are on the same page when it comes to making a lifetime commitment. Step 4: Ask for her parents' permission If your partner comes from a culture where this is important, make an effort to ask for their blessing before proposing to her. Step 5: Choose the perfect location and moment Plan a memorable, romantic setting for the proposal. This could be at a favorite spot, a meaningful location, or a completely new and exciting place. Step 6: Purchase the right ring Choose a ring that fits her personality and preferences. Talk to her friends or family for guidance if necessary. Step 7: Prepare your speech Take the time to write down your thoughts and practice your proposal speech. This will allow you to express your feelings and intentions clearly and confidently when the moment comes. Step 8: Propose After all the planning, execute your proposal confidently and genuinely. Remember that the moment is about the love you share, so focus on that and let your emotions shine through. In conclusion, the two questions address different aspects of the relationship and require distinct approaches. The first question centers on getting a girl to propose to you, while the second question is about proposing to a girl. Both questions revolve around love, commitment, and the concept of marriage.

Bill O'Reilly: America and Syria Next month, we begin our 18th year here on The Factor a very long ride. And from the beginning, from the beginning one of my major themes has been the basic nobility of this country. That separates me from some on the left who think the U.S. is an exploitative place where the fix is in against the poor and working classes. Simply put, I believe America offers the greatest amount of people the best chance at a free and prosperous life and tens of millions of immigrants agree with me. Folks aren't going to Cuba, China, or even Finland. Folks want to come here. Also, since World War II the U.S.A. has literally freed hundreds of millions of people worldwide. We have righted many wrongs at great expense in our blood and treasure. That, of course, is noble. But now many Americans do not want to make that sacrifice any longer. Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, those theaters of war have hurt this country. Thousands of brave men and women were killed or maimed. Our treasury depleted. Thus, some Americans have had enough. They are now willing to let evil go unchallenged because there is a never-ending supply of it. But I say that we Americans still have a responsibility to stop mass murder when we can as long as we don't damage our infrastructure in the process. Removing Saddam Hussein was noble but the cost was too high. Giving the Afghan people a chance at freedom is noble but the folks there may not care enough to embrace it. So what about Syria? No question the Syrian dictator, Assad kills women and children at will. No question, Iran is helping him do it. The evidence is strong that Assad violated the Geneva Convention by using poison gas to kill civilians. Thus, he is a war criminal. If the U.S.A. can punish Assad, we should but we have to be smart about it. We can't direct his overthrow but we can send a message to every tyrant in the world, slaughter civilians and you'll pay a steep price. Right now many evil men and women believe the U.S.A. is weak and lacks the courage to right wrongs. Certainly the Russian tyrant Putin believes that and so do some in the Chinese government. Back home we now have many Conservative people willing to give Assad a pass because they don't trust President Obama. Ironically, it was about ten years ago that many liberal people did not want to move against Saddam because they didn't trust President Bush. Same mind-set, different ideology. If the U.S.A. fails to act against Assad, the unintended consequence would be a loss of respect from those who care about a just world. If we sit back and do nothing, we will set up a free-fire zone where no weapons are off limits. Biological would be next. Mark my words. President Obama is correct in asking Congress to affirm his decision to punish Assad. The world needs to see exactly how our system works. Debate on the issue is good but in the end -- in the end, America needs to do what is right. We should use our power to protect the innocent if we can. Great Britain may not have the will to do that anymore but we Americans should set a better example for the world. If we don't -- if we don't, we will slowly lose the nobility that was gained by past sacrifice. Unfortunately, in this world, justice can be imposed by one people only -- us.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which runner has a greater chance of getting a tendon injury? Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running. Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Jim has a greater chance of getting a tendon injury because he skipped his warm-up before exercising. This puts his muscles and tendons at a higher risk of injury as compared to Tom who warmed up properly before running."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

[+] a few months [+] a few weeks [+] not enough information [+] Their whole life Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

The term \\"piracy\\" is used in relation to copyright infringement. In the context of the Berne Convention, it refers to the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of protected literary and artistic works. Essentially, the Berne Convention is an international agreement aimed at providing consistent and comprehensive copyright protection to authors and creators of various artistic and literary works. This agreement has been adopted by many countries who are considered \\"member countries\\" or member states of the Union. Article 12 of this convention specifically deals with the seizure of pirated works upon their importation into member countries where the original work is protected by copyright laws. The purpose of this provision is to prevent illegal reproductions or copies of copyrighted works from being circulated and sold in countries where the creators of these works have legal protection. By doing so, the Berne Convention aims to uphold the value and integrity of the artistic and literary creations and protect the rights and interests of their authors. In other words, the convention utilizes the term \\"piracy\\" to convey copyright infringement and outlines a countermeasure in the form of possible seizure on importation. This measure is put in place to ensure the authors' legal protections are maintained, and the unauthorized use or reproduction of their works is deterred, which ultimately preserves their intellectual and creative rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Entailment in linguistics refers to the logical inference where the truth of one statement (Hypothesis) is absolutely enforced by the truth of another (Premise). It means that if the Premise is true, then the Hypothesis must also be true. In this case, both the premise and hypothesis express a similar state of uncertainty or doubt from the speaker. The premise \\"I'm not really sure to tell you the truth\\" reflects a level of uncertainty or hesitancy about a fact or situation. Similarly, the hypothesis \\"I'm not certain, to be honest\\" express the same lack of confidence or certainty about a given fact or situation. In both the statements, the speakers are disclosing their doubt or lack of sureness. The premise and the hypothesis, essentially, express the same sentiment, although in slightly different words. Therefore, there is an entailment present, as the broad meaning of uncertainty carried in the hypothetical statement can logically follow from the premise. The truthfulness of the premise enforces the truthfulness of the hypothesis. Hence, the premise does entail the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

California lags far behind comparable states in funding legal services for the poor, a situation so dire that only 28 percent of the civil legal needs of the state's poor and lowerincome residents are being addressed. That figures translates into 2 million people without the ability to access the justice system, according to a new study by the California Commission on Access to Justice, which also found that despite increased spending, the gap between need and services remains substantial. \\"As a practical matter, in most cases there can be no access to justice without access to legal assistance,\\" said Jack Londen, past commission chair and a partner with Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco. \\"Whether we like it or not, sometimes landlords illegally evict tenants, children with disabilities are denied proper care, veterans don't get services guaranteed to them, and elderly people need legal assistance to escape the abuse of a caregiver.\\" California has the highest number of people in poverty in the nation - 6.4 million, including nearly one in five children. Half the nation's increase in poverty in the 1990s, when the number of poor jumped 30 percent, occurred in California, and nearly 25 percent of the nation's poverty increase occurred in Los Angeles County alone. Even those with jobs are suffering: 26 percent of California workers earn poverty level wages. The commission's report, \\"The Path to Equal Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" examined how the legal needs of the state's poor have changed in the last five years as well as both the shortcomings of the justice system and the improvements during that period. Despite increases in state funding to meet the legal needs of the poor, low interest rates (which have reduced the IOLTA fund), high unemployment and the present economic downturn have threatened any gains. Question: \\"Who made the following remark: \\"Whether we like it or not, sometimes landlords illegally evict tenants, children with disabilities are denied proper care, veterans don't get services guaranteed to them, and elderly people need legal assistance to escape the abuse of a caregiver.\\"\\" Response: \\"Morreston\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

(1) In his Karachi workshop he paints in the open air and draws his ideas on the ground . (2) In his Karachi workshop , he sketches in the open air and paints his ideas on the ground . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"While these two sentences are quite similar and convey a similar idea, they are not exactly the same due to the slightly different choice of words and phrasing. Let's break down these differences for a clearer understanding: 1. In his Karachi workshop he paints in the open air and draws his ideas on the ground. In this first sentence, there are two main activities being described: painting and drawing. Here, the artist is specifically said to be painting in the open air, which invokes a broader, more general image of the artistic process. Additionally, the sentence specifies that the artist \\"draws his ideas on the ground,\\" emphasizing the initial visualization of his ideas through drawing. 2. In his Karachi workshop, he sketches in the open air and paints his ideas on the ground. In the second sentence, the two main activities are now sketching and painting. While sketching is similar to drawing, it implies a quicker, more loosely defined method of creating art, and the initial visualization of ideas through sketching might be less detailed or precise than with drawing. Painting is mentioned in both sentences; however, in this second sentence the artist \\"paints his ideas on the ground\\" rather than \\"draws,\\" suggesting that the artist's ideas take their primary form in painting itself rather than in the preliminary drawings, unlike in the first sentence. In summary, both sentences share the idea that the artist works in an open-air workshop in Karachi and creates his art on the ground. However, the first sentence emphasizes the role of drawing in the artist's process, while the second sentence emphasizes sketching, implying a looser initial visualization of ideas, which are mainly expressed through painting."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970.

Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"Who was the plaintiff in Baze v. Rees?\\" is in \\"Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\".

Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. The genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. Quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation. However, although the genetic sites are known, there is still much to...\\"?

Answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — The United States is escalating trans-Atlantic and North American trade tensions, imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico beginning on Friday. The U.S. also negotiated quotas or volume limits on other countries, such as South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil, instead of tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also told reporters Thursday by telephone. China's foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about U.S. decision. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \\"are over'\\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \\"highly restrictive\\" trade practices. Trump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors. \\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \\"They're critical for national security.\\" But the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce. European Union Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said shortly after the tariffs took effect they were illegal and the 28-nation bloc would initiate a settlement dispute case with the World Trade Organization. \\"We can do so. We have the right to do so. I think we must do so, as well, to show that we cannot just take these tariffs and stand silent and we do not accept these kind of imposed illegal tariffs,\\" said Malmstrom.

Article: In earliest times, men considered lightning to be one of the great mysteries of nature. Some ancient people believed that lightning and thunder were the weapons of the gods. In reality, lightning is a flow of electricity formed high above the earth. A single flash of lightning 1.6 kilometers long has enough electricity to light one million light bulbs . The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, was the first to show the connection between electricity and lightning in 1752. In the same year he also built the first lightning rod . This device protects buildings from being damaged by lightning. Modern science has discovered that one stroke of lightning has a voltage of more than 15 million volts . A flash of lightning between a cloud and the earth may be as long as 13 kilometers, and travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second.

How does this story end? (CNN) -- A Colorado woman is being pursued as a \\"person of interest\\" in connection with phone calls that triggered the raid of a Texas polygamist ranch, authorities said Friday. Rozita Swinton, 33, has been arrested in a case that is not directly related to the Texas raid. Texas Rangers are seeking Rozita Swinton of Colorado Springs, Colorado, \\"regarding telephone calls placed to a crisis center hot line in San Angelo, Texas, in late March 2008,\\" the Rangers said in a written statement. The raid of the YFZ (Yearning for Zion) Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, came after a caller -- who identified herself as a 16-year-old girl -- said she had been physically and sexually abused by an adult man with whom she was forced into a \\"spiritual marriage.\\" Authorities raided the","completion":"YFZ Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, in April 2008, resulting in what became one of the largest child custody cases in the United States. Nearly 430 children were removed from the ranch by state authorities due to allegations of child abuse and forced marriages. This case garnered national attention, as it shed light on the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), led by its infamous leader, Warren Jeffs, who was already in custody on separate charges. Rozita Swinton was eventually charged with false reporting after a thorough investigation of the phone calls she made to the crisis center. Swinton allegedly made numerous false reports to the authorities in several states, which led her to be pursued in connection with the Texas polygamist ranch raid. Over time, her motivations for making these calls remain unclear. While Swinton's false reporting played a significant role in triggering the raid on the FLDS ranch, this incident helped uncover the ongoing practices of abuse and illegal marriages within the sect. Subsequent investigations led to several indictments of key FLDS leaders on charges related to polygamy, underage marriages, and sexual abuse of minors. Warren Jeffs, the leader of FLDS, was later sentenced to life in prison plus twenty years for sexually assaulting two teenage girls who he had considered his brides. The conclusion of this story saw sweeping changes within the FLDS community, as legal actions and court interventions forced an overhaul of their practices. The children removed from the YFZ Ranch were gradually returned to their parents or placed in foster care, under the condition that they not be subjected to further abuse. Many families were relocated away from the ranch, and several state and federal laws were amended to better protect the rights of children in such communities. While authorities continued to monitor the activities of FLDS communities across several states, the sect saw a decline in membership and influence as knowledge of their actions became public. The aftermath of the YFZ Ranch raid led to a broader societal awareness of the pitfalls of extremist religious beliefs and the significance of protecting the rights and safety of innocent children within these communities. As for Rozita Swinton, she ultimately faced criminal charges in association with her false reporting, leading her to face the consequences for her actions. Although the motivations behind her phone calls remained uncertain, her actions inadvertently exposed a covert and dangerous sect engaging in illegal practices, leading to a better future for the children involved and a greater understanding of the need for continued vigilance regarding the activities of similar groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These curly fibers typically are less than 1⁄8 inch (3.2 mm) long. The term also may apply to the longer textile fiber staple lint as well as the shorter fuzzy fibers from some upland species. Linters are traditionally used in the manufacture of paper and as a raw material in the manufacture of cellulose. In the UK, linters are referred to as \\"cotton wool\\". This can also be a refined product (absorbent cotton in U.S. usage) which has medical, cosmetic and many other practical uses. The first medical use of cotton wool was by Sampson Gamgee at the Queen's Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, England. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What does wool look like?","completion":"Wool, whether it's derived from sheep, alpaca, or other wool-bearing animals, has distinct characteristics. In its raw form, right after shearing, wool appears as a thick, fluffy material, often containing some impurities such as dirt or vegetable matter. It usually has a natural color, ranging from creamy white to various shades of brown and black, depending on the breed of the animal. Texture-wise, it's soft but can be slightly scratchy to the touch. It tends to be crinkly or wavy, and different types of wool exhibit different degrees of crimp; Merino wool, for instance, has tight, fine crimps while Lincoln wool has wide, open crimps. Once the wool has been cleaned, processed, and spun into yarn, it takes a smoother appearance with fibers neatly wound together. Wool yarn might have a matte or slightly lustrous look, depending on the processing techniques used and the specific breed of animal. Additionally, wool has the unique characteristic of being an excellent insulator due to its crimped nature, which creates small insulating air pockets. Furthermore, it is naturally water-resistant because of the lanolin content in raw wool, which also gives it a distinctive smell. Do remember that the term 'wool' generally refers to the fine soft curly or wavy hair forming the coat of a sheep, goat, or similar animals. The description above does not necessarily apply to 'cotton wool' or 'cotton linter,' which are plant-derived and thus have significantly different properties, despite the shared common name. Cotton wool, mentioned in the initial description, is typically made from the short fibers remaining on the cotton seed after ginning, and it is generally softer, less crimped, and more absorbent compared to animal-derived wool."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: It's Late In The Game, And Mitt Romney Has One Last Shot At Winning Moment For the first 45 minutes of Saturday night’s Republican presidential debate, believe it or not, Michele Bachmann had the best answers. Her “Newt Romney” refrain was clever, funny, intriguing -- and pointed out how similar these two Rockefeller Republican flip-floppers really are on a range of issues. Mitt Romney pulled a “Pawlenty” when he was asked to state the main differences between him and Gingrich. His answer? Four things -- the first being the creation of a moon colony -- and another being a difference in capital gains tax cuts thresholds. Are you kidding me? This was the moment for Romney to tell conservative primary voters why he is their man -- and what is wrong with Newt. And the first thing he mentions is a Moon Colony? The second hour saw Newt Gingrich defend his Palestinian statement on the Jewish Channel. He did well on this, as he did on defending his record of earning a ton of money as a private citizen. Romney refused to go after Newt on this -- yet his surrogates are doing it out on the stump. Why doesn’t Mitt do it himself? The media will make a big deal out of Romney’s attempt to wager 10,000 with Rick Perry. The “10,000” moment will reinforce the image of Romney as a rich guy who is out-of-touch with the caucusgoers. Thursday night on Fox -- and FoxNews.com -- there will be the final Iowa debate. It will be Romney’s last opportunity to take the race away from Newt. Will he seize it? Or will he pull another “Pawlenty” -- named for Tim Pawlenty, when it was all teed up for him in the first debate in New Hampshire last spring -- and he refused to go after Mitt Romney on health care. Santorum, Perry and Ron Paul -- as usual -- got the shaft in allocation of air time. How is this fair? Shouldn’t all the candidates get the same amount of time? Bachmann got more than usual -- and this was by far her best performance of the campaign. But it was too little, too late for her. She should have done this well three months ago. Newt -- again -- did very well. He came out totally unscathed, which was his goal as the new front-runner. Mitt -- as usual -- was steady and professional and prepared. And boring. He didn’t win any voters over to him. Thursday night is his last chance to change the dynamic of this race. If he doesn’t do it on Thursday, he will lose Iowa – and the whole race can then tumble out of his control. Former Congressman John LeBoutillier is co-host of CAMPAIGN CONFIDENTIAL, which airs each Monday at 2 p.m. on FoxNews.com Summary:","completion":"During a Republican presidential debate, Michele Bachmann had a strong opening 45 minutes, while Mitt Romney's performance was seen as steady and professional but lacking excitement. Romney's answers, particularly when highlighting the differences between himself and rival Newt Gingrich, were seen as weak. Romney's last chance to change the dynamic of the race comes in the final Iowa debate on Thursday night; failure to impress could lead to a loss in Iowa and potentially a loss of control over the entire election."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who replaced Zack de la Rocha?, what is it ? A:","completion":"The full name of the person who replaced Zack de la Rocha in the band is Chris Cornell. He was the ex-frontman of Soundgarden and was suggested as a potential new vocalist for the remaining members of Rage Against the Machine by music producer and friend, Rick Rubin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you say the word in French? In Chinese? In your language? Although people usually know what the word means,it sometimes has no exact translation.It's not surprising,because the idea of home is different from country to country,and from person to person.A home is more than a roof and four walls.It's the cooking,eating,talking,playing and sleeping that go on inside.And at home you usually feel safe and relaxed. Homes look different in different countries.They also have different things inside.For example,in cold northern Europe,there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it.In the south,where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out,there are small windows and cool stone floors.

Carroll Baker was born and raised in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in a Roman Catholic family, the daughter of Edith Gertrude (nee Duffy) and William Watson Baker, a traveling salesman. She is of Polish descent, which has given rise to a rumor that her birth name was Karolina Piekarski. However, this currently cannot be substantiated by known records. Baker's parents separated when she was eight years old, and she moved with her mother and younger sister, Virginia, to Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. Baker portrayed a pacifist Quaker schoolteacher in John Ford's Cheyenne Autumn (1964), and received critical acclaim for the role. She then had a supporting role as Saint Veronica in George Stevens' The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), and portrayed a cynical, alcoholic movie star in The Carpetbaggers (1964), which brought her a second wave of notoriety in spite of the film's lackluster reviews. The New York Times called the film \\"a sickly sour distillation\\" of the source novel, but said Baker's performance \\"brought some color and a sandpaper personality as the sex-loaded widow.\\" The film was the top moneymaker of that year, with domestic box-office receipts of 13,000,000, and marked the beginning of a tumultuous relationship with the film's producer, Joseph E. Levine. Based on her Carpetbaggers performance, Levine began to develop Baker as a movie sex symbol, and she appeared posing in the December 1964 issue of Playboy. She was subsequently cast by Levine in the title roles of two 1965 potboilers-- Sylvia, as an ex-prostitute and con artist, and as Jean Harlow in Harlow. Baker appeared on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post on their November 2, 1963, issue dressed as Harlow, promoting the film's upcoming production. In 1965, she became an official celebrity spokesperson for Foster Grant sunglasses and appeared in advertisements for the company. Baker likened this era of her career to \\"being a beauty contest winner [as opposed to] an actress.\\" Despite much prepublicity, Harlow received a lukewarm response from critics: Variety referred to Baker's portrayal of Harlow as \\"a fairly reasonable facsimile, although she lacks the electric fire of the original.\\" Relations between Baker and Levine soured; in a 1965 interview, Baker sardonically commented: \\"I'll say this about Joe Levine: I admire his taste in leading ladies,\\" which led the press to suspect a rift between the actress and producer. Baker sued Levine over her contract with Paramount Pictures in 1966, and was ultimately fired by Paramount and had her paychecks from Harlow frozen amid the contentious legal dispute; this left Baker hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt (however, she was eventually awarded 1 million in compensation). In an interview with Rex Reed in his book People Are Crazy Here (1974), Baker revealed that she had felt pressure in both her working relationship with Levine, and her domestic life with her husband, the latter of whom she said wanted to maintain an expensive lifestyle: \\"We'd been very poor when we started out at the Actors Studio in New York,\\" she told Reed. \\"I was under contract to Joe Levine, who was going around giving me diamonds and behaving like he owned me. I never slept with him or anything, but everyone thought I was his mistress.\\" In the spring of 1966, Baker returned to theatre, performing in a production of Anna Christie at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles. The production was directed by Garfein. The production was heralded as the \\"theatre event of the week\\" in Los Angeles, though its reception was middling. Cecil Smith of The Los Angeles Times wrote of the production: \\"The beautiful Miss Baker's vehicle becomes a hearse.\\" The play was also performed at the Tappan Zee Playhouse in Nyack, New York in June 1966.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who claims his adopted child is of a destitute family friend? is inside the article: From her Parkville jail cell, Vergie Winters watches the funeral procession of Senator John Shadwell and remembers her twenty-year past with him: The moment young lawyer John returns to Parkville from an extended honeymoon with his social climbing wife Laura, he visits Vergie, his former lover. After a passionate embrace, John explains to the youthful milliner that he had abandoned their romance because Vergie's father had told him that she was pregnant by laborer Hugo McQueen and would be forced to marry. Vergie then tells John that, to keep her from marrying John, Laura's father had paid her father 10,000 to tell him that devastating lie. Still deeply in love, John and Vergie continue to see each other, but when John starts to campaign for Congress, Preston, a political boss, informs Vergie that, if John is to receive his vital support, she must forego their affair. Although Vergie agrees to Preston's terms, John refuses to end the relationship and spends a long evening with her before the election. After a victorious win, John moves to Washington, D.C. with Laura, Vergie bears his child under an assumed name. John then adopts the baby, named Joan, whom he claims is the child of a destitute family friend. At the start of World War I, John returns to Parkville and once again resumes his affair with Vergie. When one of John's late night rendezvous is witnessed by a town gossip and reported to Mike Davey, John's only political enemy, Vergie's successful millinery shop is boycotted, and she is shunned by all but the local prostitutes. In addition, Davey hires Preston's son Barry to steal from Preston's home safe a page from a hotel register on which Vergie had written her assumed name. As Barry is breaking into his father's safe, however, Preston mistakes him for a burglar and kills him, but tells his butler that a burglar shot his son., can you guess it ?

If I tell you that Feathers provide insulation for the flightless. , and ask you the question \\"why do the flightless have feathers?\\", is the correct answer \\"layers of fat\\"?","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"layers of fat.\\" Feathers provide insulation for flightless birds like penguins and ostriches, offering significant benefits in terms of body heat regulation and protection from the cold and harsh environments they often live in. Although these flightless birds may also have layers of fat as a source of insulation, the primary purpose of their feathers is to trap air close to their bodies, creating a layer of warmth and insulation. Feathers are composed of keratin, which is lightweight and extremely efficient in providing insulation. In addition to insulation, feathers play a role in camouflage, protection from the elements, and social displays for some flightless birds. In summary, flightless birds have feathers to mainly provide insulation and regulate body temperature, while also serving additional functions such as camouflage, protection, and social displays. The \\"layers of fat\\" may contribute additional insulation to these flightless birds, but the primary insulating factor is still their feathers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They find townspeople dead in the streets while reporting back to Scoop Mission Control. Suspecting the satellite may have brought back an extraterrestrial pathogen, Scoop Mission Control activates an elite scientific team it had previously recruited for just this type of emergency. Nobel laureate Dr. Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill), the team leader, and Dr. Mark Hall (James Olson), the team surgeon, are dropped in Piedmont by helicopter, where they search the town for Scoop 7 in hazmat suits. They find the town's doctor, who died after opening the satellite out of curiosity. Hall cuts open the doctor's corpse and finds that all of his blood has clotted and turned to powder. Stone and Hall retrieve Scoop 7 and find two survivors â a 62-year-old man and an infant (who \\"can't be more than 6 months old\\").

Here is a detailed evaluation of the review: 1. Language and expression: The language and tone of the review are not professional. The use of multiple periods '...' and incorrect spelling (such as \\"plz\\") indicates that the reviewer did not put enough effort into crafting their feedback. This unprofessionalism slightly detracts from the credibility of the review. 2. Mentioning specific issues: The reviewer does highlight specific problems with the update, such as not showing the proper percentage. This aspect is helpful for both potential users and the developers, as it points out a concern that can be addressed. 3. Lack of contextual information: The review would have been more helpful if the reviewer had included some context about the application or product they are reviewing. Without such information, it is unclear which product or service the reviewer is referring to, which prevents the feedback from being as useful as it could be. 4. Feedback for improvement: The reviewer asks the developers to \\"fix it,\\" implying that they are providing feedback for improvement and not just complaining. This is an essential aspect of any review, as it gives the developers an opportunity to better understand users' pain points and take the necessary steps to make improvements. 5. Limited depth: Overall, the review is relatively short and lacks detailed explanations of the issues it mentions. By providing more context and a thorough explanation of the problem, the review could have been more helpful to potential users and developers alike.

How does the sentence end? I had much less fun at the celebration than at the festival, because the","completion":"celebration felt more forced and inauthentic, whereas the festival had an atmosphere of genuine joy and connection that permeated the air. To begin with, the celebration seemed like it was put together haphazardly, with a last-minute and somewhat disorganized approach. The event coordinators seemed to be scrambling around trying to coordinate activities, services, and entertainment options, which ultimately led to a disjointed and uninviting atmosphere. This lack of planning and attention to detail made it difficult to engage with the event on a deeper level, causing the overall experience to fall short in comparison to the carefully curated festival I attended earlier. Secondly, the overall energy and atmosphere at the celebration seemed artificial, as if people were pretending to have a great time just for the sake of keeping up appearances. There was an underlying sense of obligation and duty to attend and enjoy the event, which diminished its ability to foster genuine connections and moments of spontaneous joy. The festival, on the other hand, was characterized by an infectious energy, where people genuinely seemed to be having the time of their lives with their friends, family, and sometimes even complete strangers. This authentic enthusiasm was contagious, resulting in an environment that was both inclusive and deeply satisfying on an emotional level. Another factor that contributed to my lackluster experience at the celebration was the poor quality of the entertainment provided. While the festival showcased an array of talented performers, musicians, and artists who were passionate about their craft, the celebration seemed to settle for second-rate talent, which only served to emphasize the overall lack of effort and investment in creating a memorable experience. The uninspired performances only added to the feeling of disconnect from the event, ultimately detracting from the potential for any genuine enjoyment. Moreover, the limited range of activities and attractions available at the celebration left much to be desired. I found that the festival offered a diverse range of attractions, catering to various interests and age groups, and thus enriching the overall experience. Activities such as workshops, food stalls, interactive installations, and immersive experiences were just a few examples of what the festival had to offer. In contrast, the celebration seemed to lack this level of variety and diversity, which consequently limited its scope for engagement and entertainment. Lastly, the sense of community at the festival far surpassed that of the celebration. The shared moments of joy, laughter, and connection created at the festival formed lasting bonds, where participants felt like they were part of something truly special. Meanwhile, the celebration seemed to maintain a certain level of superficiality and failed to foster a genuine sense of togetherness among the attendees. In conclusion, my experience at the celebration was a pale imitation of the authentic enjoyment I felt at the festival. From the chaotic organization and disingenuous atmosphere to the lackluster entertainment and limited activities, the celebration simply could not compare to the vibrancy and richness of the festival experience. It served as a potent reminder that genuine connection, passion, and community can make all the difference when it comes to creating truly memorable and fulfilling events."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For starters, Google has confirmed that the Nexus 10 will be running Android 4.2 out of the box, so get excited. It will also come equipped with a 10-inch display running at an impressive 2560x1600 resolution. On the inside, it'll have a A15 dual-core processor running alongside 2GB of RAM ,so expect the Nexus 10 to be a speedy little tablet.

Microsoft's Surface Release date: Oct 26,2012 Operating system: Windows 8 RT Size: 27.5 x 17.2 x 0.9... Question: What is the 7.9-inch iPad Mini's major contribution to the customers? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Size\\"? Answer:","completion":"The 7.9-inch iPad Mini's major contribution to customers lies in its combination of an impressive display size and a distinctively thinner and lighter form factor compared to its bigger counterpart, the 9.7-inch iPad. The iPad Mini brings Apple's unique product design, aesthetics, and operating system (iOS 6) to the mini-tablet market, offering a high-quality user experience and App Store ecosystem that Apple's customers are fond of. While the iPad Mini's size does indeed play an important role in its appeal, it would be an oversimplification to attribute its major contribution to customers solely to its size. In addition to its size, the iPad Mini offers a balance of processing power, battery life, portability, and cost that appeals to customers who desire a more compact option without sacrificing the premium experience that Apple's tablets are known for. With competitors such as Google's Nexus 10 and Microsoft's Surface offering various sizes, operating systems, and features in their respective tablets, the iPad Mini is Apple's response to meet diverse consumer preferences in form factor and functionality. As a result, the iPad Mini provides customers with a strong alternative within the mini-tablet market, rather than simply relying on its size."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The network is designed to safeguard the future of rich and diverse coastal habitats and maintain a healthy marine ecosystem. Some opposition has been put forward by fishermen, and the scheme could also impact on offshore renewable energy. The Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 included new powers to select and manage Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). In a report to the Scottish Parliament, Scottish Natural Heritage and UK-wide advisory body the Joint Nature Conservation Committee have put forward 33 MPA proposals. A further four areas have been identified to protect dolphins, whales and basking sharks, along with proposals for black guillemot, sandeels and tidal fronts to enhance protection for seabirds. Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said: \\"Accounting for 13% of Europe's seas and 61% of UK waters, Scotland's seas include many diverse habitats, with rare and beautiful species that it is our responsibility to protect. \\"That's why the Marine Act included ambitious commitments to safeguards our seas. \\"Not only that but a healthy marine ecosystem underpins the nursery grounds for the species our fishermen rely on, the reefs and kelp forests that protect our coasts by buffering against storms - as well as the clean waters needed to absorb carbon dioxide and help in the fight against climate change.\\" Scottish Natural Heritage called the report an important milestone. Chief executive Ian Jardine said: \\"Scotland's seas are a fantastic asset that contributes enormously to our quality of life and our economy. Managing them in a sustainable way is a complex task.\\" RSPB Scotland said the proposals were a step in the right direction, but represented a \\"massive missed opportunity\\". Director Stuart Housden said: \\"Despite Scotland being globally important for these species, seabirds have been almost completely marginalised in the identification of Scotland's new Marine Protected Areas. \\"These proposals offer precious little protection for Scotland's seabirds - iconic species like the puffin, razorbill and kittiwake. \\"The government claims seabirds will be adequately protected by Special Protection Areas designated under European legislation. Let there be no confusion - these promised SPAs are essential, but they cannot and will not protect nationally important concentrations of seabirds feeding at sea.\\" Fishermen in the Western Isles have campaigned against the creation of a Special Area of Conservation in the Sound of Barra. The new Marine Protected Areas could also have an impact on the positioning and design of offshore renewables. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said they would study the proposals. He added: \\"It is absolutely essential that science guides the process, which must serve the requirements of the marine environment and of sustainable harvesting of seafood. \\"If MPAs in Scottish waters are properly organised, the objectives should actively support each other.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The Scottish government is thinking about protecting a huge area of sea, about the same size as the whole country! This plan is to keep the beautiful sea animals and their homes safe and make sure the sea stays healthy. Some people, like fishermen, are not very happy about this because it might make their jobs harder, and it could also affect how we get some of our energy from the sea. The people in charge want to protect special areas for dolphins, whales, and other sea creatures. The people who want to protect the birds say this plan is nice but doesn't help birds very much."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony and only six weeks before the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse, Burmese. Police later discovered that the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three. The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.

A:","completion":"John Knibb, an eminent English clock- and watchmaker, was born on January 21, 1650, in Claydon, a small village in the county of Oxfordshire, England. He grew up in a modest household, showing keen interest and skill in the world of horology from a young age. As the son of a humble family, young Knibb's natural talent and passion for this intricate craft would go on to define his life and career, ultimately propelling him towards a legacy in the field. John Knibb was the younger brother of the equally famous clockmaker Joseph Knibb, who influenced and guided him in the nascent stages of his career. Under Joseph's tutelage, John learned the many secrets of the trade and began to develop a unique style that would later characterize his work. The familial bond between the two brothers and their shared vocation led them to collaborate on various projects, mutually enhancing their skills and reputation. John Knibb's career took off in 1664 when he moved to Oxford, and it was here, in this prestigious hub of learning and culture, that his work began to truly flourish. Oxford not only offered a world of opportunities for a skilled master like Knibb but also exposed him to well-heeled clientele who appreciated his craft and were willing to pay for it. This newfound recognition fueled Knibb's ambition and nurtured his creativity, driving him to produce increasingly sophisticated timepieces. Over the course of his illustrious career, John Knibb gained a reputation for his unparalleled craftsmanship, technical mastery, and visually striking designs. His clocks and watches were renowned for their attention to detail and blend of elegance and functionality. Among his many creations, John Knibb is best known for his long case clocks, bracket clocks, and wall clocks, several of which can still be admired today in private collections, museums, and even some Oxford colleges. Knibb's stellar work added to the prestige of Oxford as a center of horology during the 17th and 18th centuries. His contributions to the craft were widely celebrated, and he became a prominent member of the community. By the 1670s, John Knibb had become a respected entrepreneur, employing a small group of craftsmen and apprentices, and was appointed a burgess of the city of Oxford, a testament to his growing stature and influence. John Knibb's eventful life came to an end on July 18, 1722, in Oxford, the city that played the most significant role in shaping his celebrated career. Even centuries after his death, the name John Knibb remains synonymous with innovation, precision, and beauty, with his clocks and watches serving as lasting testaments to his extraordinary talent and craftsmanship. As one of the most renowned English clockmakers of his time, John Knibb's legacy continues to inspire enthusiasts and collectors worldwide, cementing his place in horological history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Complete the following sentence. I failed my math test even though I used a study guide. The","completion":"main reasons behind my failure can be attributed to several factors such as insufficient preparation, lack of understanding of key concepts, poor study habits, insufficient practice, test anxiety, and the inefficiency of the study guide used. Firstly, insufficient preparation can be a significant factor responsible for my failure. Even though I used a study guide, I may not have dedicated enough time and effort to thoroughly learn the material covered in the test. This could stem from procrastination, overestimating my abilities, or underestimating the difficulty of the subject matter. To address this issue, I should adopt a more disciplined approach to my study schedule and allocate adequate time for reviewing each section covered in the guide. Secondly, lack of understanding of key concepts could result in a poor performance on the math test. Sometimes, relying solely on a study guide may not be enough, as it might provide only a superficial understanding of the subject. In order to gain a deeper comprehension of mathematical principles, I should seek additional resources such as textbooks, lecture notes, and online tutorials. Moreover, I could consult with my instructor or classmates for clarification on concepts that I find challenging. Poor study habits can also be a contributing factor in failing the math test. For instance, I may have relied too much on memorization rather than developing a proper understanding of the concepts. Other ineffective study habits include multitasking and studying in a distracting environment. To rectify these issues, I ought to focus on active learning strategies and cultivate a distraction-free study area where I can concentrate on my work. The lack of sufficient practice can hinder my ability to perform well in a math test. Mathematics, as a subject, requires consistent practice in order to apply learned concepts and techniques accurately. Merely reviewing the study guide and not working through practice problems or attempting sample tests may have left me unequipped to tackle the exam questions. To improve in this area, I should allocate ample time for solving practice problems and review my mistakes for better understanding. Test anxiety can also adversely affect my performance on a math test. The pressure to succeed and fear of failure can lead to nervousness, loss of concentration, and an inability to recall crucial information during the exam. To manage test anxiety, I should work on developing coping mechanisms such as relaxation techniques, positive self-talk, and mental rehearsal of the test situation. Lastly, the inefficiency of the study guide used could be another reason for my failure. It is possible that the study guide did not adequately cover the topics tested or failed to provide accurate examples and explanations. In such a case, I should consider researching and investing in better study resources that cater to my unique learning preferences and requirements. In conclusion, my failure in the math test, despite using a study guide, can be attributed to a combination of factors, including insufficient preparation, lack of understanding of key concepts, poor study habits, not practicing enough, test anxiety, and the inefficiency of the study guide. In order to improve my performance in future math tests, I should address these issues and work on developing effective learning strategies and habits. By making these adjustments, I can increase my chances of performing better in future exams and consequently, mastering the subject matter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

David Jon Gilmour, (born 6 March 1946) is an English guitarist, singer and songwriter best known as a longtime member of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. He joined the group as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1968, effectively as a replacement for founder member Syd Barrett, who was dismissed from the band shortly afterwards. Pink Floyd subsequently achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling acts in the history of popular music; it was estimated that by 2012 the band had sold over 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million units sold in the United States. David Jon Gilmour was born on 6 March 1946 in Cambridge, England. His father, Douglas Gilmour, eventually became a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge, and his mother, Sylvia (nee Wilson), trained as a teacher and later worked as a film editor for the BBC. At the time of Gilmour's birth they lived in Trumpington, Cambridgeshire, but in 1956, after several relocations, the couple moved their family to Grantchester Meadows. Gilmour's parents encouraged him to pursue his interest in music, and in 1954 he bought his first single, Bill Haley's \\"Rock Around the Clock\\". His enthusiasm for music was stirred the following year by Elvis Presley's \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", and later \\"Bye Bye Love\\" by the Everly Brothers piqued his interest in the guitar. He then borrowed one from his neighbour, but never gave it back. Soon afterward, he started teaching himself to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger. At age 11, Gilmour began attending the Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he \\"didn't enjoy\\". While there he met future Pink Floyd guitarist Syd Barrett and bass guitarist Roger Waters, who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, which was also situated on Hills Road. In 1962, Gilmour began studying A-Level modern languages at Cambridge Technical College. Despite not finishing the course, he eventually learnt to speak fluent French. Barrett was also a student at the college, and he spent his lunchtimes practising guitar with Gilmour. In late 1962, Gilmour joined the blues rock band Jokers Wild. They recorded a one-sided album and a single at Regent Sound Studio, in west London, but only fifty copies of each were made. In August 1965, Gilmour busked around Spain and France with Barrett and some other friends, performing songs by the Beatles. They were not very successful, getting arrested on one occasion and living a virtually hand-to-mouth existence, which resulted in Gilmour requiring treatment in a hospital for malnutrition. He and Barrett later trekked to Paris, where they camped outside the city for a week and visited the Louvre. During that time Gilmour worked in various places, most notably as the driver and assistant for fashion designer Ossie Clark. Gilmour travelled to France in mid-1967 with Rick Wills and Willie Wilson, formerly of Jokers Wild. The trio performed under the band name Flowers, then Bullitt, but they were not commercially successful. After hearing their uninspired covers of current chart hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in Paris, thieves stole their equipment. While in France, Gilmour contributed--as a session musician--lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film Two Weeks in September, starring Brigitte Bardot.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How will we become extinct? How and when will humans likely become extinct? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Pick your answer from: (a). no. (b). yes.","completion":"(b). yes. The two questions are indeed paraphrases of each other, as they both seek to understand the potential causes and timeline for human extinction. It is essential to note, however, that predicting the precise cause and timeframe for human extinction is inherently uncertain and speculative. Nevertheless, I will provide an overview of some possible scenarios that could lead to the extinction of the human species. 1. Climate Change: As the planet continues to warm due to human-induced climate change, we face an increased likelihood of extreme weather events, food and water scarcity, and the subsequent breakdown of societies. These factors could jeopardize the long-term survival of the human species. If we fail to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change in time, its worsening consequences could eventually lead to our extinction. 2. Nuclear War: The potential for a global nuclear conflict remains a significant threat to human survival. The vast stockpiles of nuclear weapons and the unpredictable nature of international relations make the possibility of an all-out nuclear war a genuine concern. The aftermath of such an event would annihilate most of the human population, severely damage the environment, and render Earth uninhabitable for many years, potentially leading to human extinction. 3. Pandemics: Global pandemics, like the current COVID-19 outbreak, pose a significant risk to human populations. While modern medicine has proven effective at combating many diseases, the possibility of a highly contagious, rapidly mutating, and deadly virus or bacteria emerging and spreading globally cannot be ruled out. An uncontrollable pandemic could potentially result in the extinction of the human species. 4. Artificial Intelligence and Automation: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies raises concerns about the future of humanity. If AI becomes superintelligent and develops goals that conflict with human interests, it could be an existential threat to our species. Moreover, as automation technologies continue to displace human labor, social, and economic disruptions could cause societal collapse and threaten our survival. 5. Cosmic Events: Large scale cosmic events, such as an asteroid impact, gamma-ray bursts, or a nearby supernova explosion, are rare but pose a significant extinction risk. Given the vast time scales on which such events occur, it is difficult to predict when such an event might threaten human survival. However, the consequences of such an event could be cataclysmic, resulting in the extinction of the human species. In conclusion, several potential scenarios could lead to human extinction, and the uncertainty surrounding these events makes it particularly challenging to predict a specific cause or timeline. What is clear, however, is that addressing these threats and taking proactive steps to ensure the long-term survival of our species should be a priority for present and future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Following a major road victory against the Colts, the Patriots returned home to face another tough team in the Detroit Lions. The Patriots re-signed last season's star LeGarrette Blount who had been released by the Steelers earlier that week after leaving a game early. On the opening possession of the game Matthew Stafford hit Golden Tate for gains of 24 and 17 yards en route to the Patriots 34, but could only settle for a Matt Prater 48-yard field goal. Later, midway through the first quarter, the Patriots raced 64 yards in 9 plays scoring on Brady's 4-yard touchdown pass to Tim Wright. The Lions replied on their very next possession, driving 78 yards to the Patriots 2-yard line, but the Patriots and their elite red zone defense did their thing and Prater added a 20-yard field goal. It was all Patriots for the rest of the half. Danny Amendola returned the ensuing kickoff 81 yards to the Detroit 22. A 16-yard pass to LaFell and a 3-yard encroachment penalty to Ndamukong Suh moved the ball to the 3-yard line. On the very next play Blount added a 3-yard rushing touchdown, increasing the lead to 14-6. The Lions were able to drive to the Patriots 39, but were forced to punt. Taking over at their own 7, the Patriots methodically moved 93 yards in 13 plays, culminating with Brady find Wright again, for an 8-yard touchdown pass, increasing their lead to 21-6. The Lions drove to the Patriots 35 on the ensuing possession, but Prater missed a 53-yard field goal. Taking over at their own 43, the Patriots needed just four plays to reach the Lions 17 and Gostkowski closed out the half with a 35-yard field goal as they went into the locker room up 24-6. The Patriots took the opening kickoff of the half 70 yards down to the Lions 10-yard line trying to bury Detroit, but on 1st down Tom Brady was intercepted by James Ihedigbo. Like almost every possession on the day, the Lions did nothing and punted after five plays. The Patriots proceeded to march 50 yards to the Lions 25 and Gostkowski added a 43-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 27-6. After both teams swapped three-and-outs the Lions advanced to the Patriots 31, but once again settled for a Matt Prater field goal, making the score 27-9 early in the fourth quarter. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Lions reached the Patriots 25, but turned the ball over on downs after Stafford slid short 1-yard short of the first down on 4th-and-10. After making the Patriots punt, Stafford was intercepted by Logan Ryan. Starting at their own 34, the Patriots marched 66 yards in 9 plays, with LeGarrette Blount finished off the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. The Lions looked liked a team that was mentally unprepared and lackluster early on with their offense struggling to score in the red zone and made horrific mistakes. At the end of the game, controversy brewed when a defensive lineman slapped the head of Patriots long snapper Danny Aiken, who ended up missing the Chargers game with a concussion, in the head that led to a personal foul penalty and a first down. The Patriots promptly scored on the next play with a 3-yard Blount touchdown, which angered Lions center Dominic Raiola. Raiola later took out his frustration on Patriots defensive lineman Zach Moore by punching him in the back of the helmet. Tom Brady was 38 of 53 for 349 yards 2 TDs (both to Tim Wright) and 1 INTs. LeGarrette Blount added 78 yard on 12 carries and two TDs in his return. Matthew Stafford struggled going only 18 of 46 for 264 yards 0 TDs and 1 INTs. Joique Bell added only 48 yards on 19 carries. Another reason the Lions couldn't get going, Darrelle Revis locked down vaunted receiver Calvin Johson holding him to just 4 catches for 58 yards and 0 TDs.

It is soon apparent that they have succeeded. Michael's parents arrive for dinner: a vegan meal prepared by a now visibly pregnant Madeline. Michael's domineering mother Vivian grimaces at the food and suggests that a more conventional diet would be healthier for the unborn baby, but Madeline refuses. The conversation turns to the couple's unsuccessful search for a suitable obstetrician. Madeline has rejected Vivian's preferred doctor and friend, Dr. Sohn. Instead she has consulted Patricia, her old friend and midwife at an independent clinic. Vivian does not hide her disapproval. Though Michael is also skeptical, the couple visit the clinic for a tour. They meet with Patricia, who describes her natural approach to birthing. Madeline reveals that she and Michael have conceived twice before, but both pregnancies were unsuccessful. One night Michael rushes Madeline to the hospital because of chest pain. Dr. Sohn arrives at Vivian's request. Just before he administers drugs to induce labor, Patricia arrives. She challenges his diagnosis and determines through blood work (which he has ignored) that inducement is not necessary. Madeline is treated and later released. On the way home from the hospital, a car accident kills both Michael and the unborn baby. Madeline refuses to go to the hospital to have the dead fetus removed. Patricia allows Madeline to carry the dead fetus to term and some weeks later the baby is delivered in Patricia's birthing tub.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Q:I read this background article the other day: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. I am facing a new situation today: John wanted to charge his electronic gadgets remotely. To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the objects would be closer to each other, case A or case B? A:","completion":"In order to answer the question, let's analyze the charging methods used in cases A and B: Case A - Conduction: Charging by conduction involves direct contact between a charged object and an uncharged object. When these two objects touch, electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. As a result, both objects have the same charge after the process. Case B - Induction: Charging by induction does not require direct contact between the charged object and the uncharged object. Instead, the charged object is brought near the uncharged object, and a change in charge occurs without the two objects touching. This causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object. Now, let's compare the proximity of the objects in these cases: In case A, the objects must be touching each other, so their distance is essentially zero. In case B, the objects don't need to touch, so their distance is greater than zero (they are close but not touching). Considering the information provided, the objects would be closer to each other in case A (conduction) than in case B (induction)."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The sentence is discussing historical changes in postage stamps used in Guam, but it does not explicitly address the current postal service system in place. Guam, an unincorporated territory of the United States, has a postal system that is similar to that of the United States. The United States Postal Service (USPS) operates in Guam and follows the same postal service procedures, regulations, and pricing structure as it does within the mainland United States. Given that regular U.S. postage stamps have been used in Guam since the discontinuation of the overprinted \\"Guam\\" stamps, this suggests that Guam's postal service has likely been maintained or overseen by the USPS.

The Chapter house was originally used in the 13th century by Benedictine monks for daily meetings. It later became a meeting place of the King's Great Council and the Commons, predecessors of Parliament. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Who else never met in the chapter house?","completion":"It is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of every individual or group that never met in the chapter house throughout history. However, we can discuss some groups and individuals who likely did not convene there, at least for any significant purposes. 1. Non-English political bodies: As the chapter house was utilized for meetings of the King's Great Council and the Commons during the 13th century, it is highly unlikely that political assemblies from other countries, such as French parliaments or Spanish cortes, would have convened there. 2. Religious groups other than Benedictine monks: Given that the Chapter House was initially built for meetings of Benedictine monks, it is improbable that gatherings of other religious communities, such as Franciscan friars or Cistercian monks, took place within the structure. 3. Medieval guilds and trade organizations: These groups typically conducted their meetings and activities in specific guildhalls or other designated locations, so it is unlikely that they would have had any reason to assemble in a space traditionally reserved for monastic or political purposes. 4. Later historical figures and organizations: As the centuries passed, the function of the chapter house most likely evolved or ceased altogether. This would imply that groups or individuals from later historical periods, such as the Tudor era, the English Civil War period, or the Industrial Revolution, did not hold meetings within the space. 5. Public gatherings and social events: While the chapter house was designed for specific meeting and governance purposes, it most likely was not a venue for large-scale social events or public gatherings, such as town fairs, theater performances, or community celebrations. In summary, although it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list of every individual or group that never met in the chapter house, we can determine that various non-Benedictine religious groups, non-English political bodies, and unrelated social or trade organizations likely did not gather there. Furthermore, it can be implied that as history progressed and the purpose of the chapter house evolved or waned, many later historical figures and groups would also have not utilized the space for their meetings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Callum Paterson - the subject of interest from Wigan Athletic - nodded the visitors ahead from Sam Nicholson's first-half corner. Thistle levelled after the break when Liam Lindsay's header crossed the line after hitting the bar. But, with time running out, striker Watt lashed a shot into the net from a tight angle. English clubs have already determined that Hearts' right-back Paterson is ready to move south - it is only differing opinions about his value that have prevented a move so far. Wigan may eventually raise their bid from the £700,000 rejected last week, but it is clear why Hearts are looking for more. Physically strong, a powerful runner and commanding in the air, Paterson's goal from Nicholson's corner was an emphatic header. He also plays an important role in Hearts' style. The team's shape is asymmetric, with Arnaud Djoum tucking in from right midfield and Nicholson playing wide on the left, requiring Paterson to provide width on the right flank, which he covers tirelessly. If the Scotland cap leaves this window, Hearts will sorely miss him. There was much to admire about both teams - their organisation, energy and ability to move the ball swiftly in crisp passages of play or directly. The coaching work of Alan Archibald and Robbie Neilson was evident, but personalities still shone through. Watt carries the ball deftly and has vision and clever instincts. Those qualities are all matched in Thistle's Chris Erskine, whose jinking, skilful runs were a feature throughout. He almost made a goal for Ade Azeez in the first half and it was his wing play that led to the corner that delivered Thistle's equaliser. Erskine took the set piece, too, swinging the ball in for Lindsay to score with a header off the underside of the bar. Sometimes managers can just allow individual ability to shine and Hearts were rewarded for leaving Watt on when he struck the winner. Neilson's starting line-up contained eight players who were called up for international duty last week, but it was the talent on their bench that set them apart. The Hearts head coach was able to bring on Bjorn Johnsen and Jamie Walker in the second half and, after Partick Thistle equalised, the visitors stepped up their tempo and pressure. That paid off in the end, but under different circumstances they might have brought on club captain Alim Ozturk, experienced midfielder Prince Buaben, young defender Liam Smith or attacker Robbie Muirhead. What Archibald would have given for those options. Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: \\"It was a sore one to take, but I thought we defended well in the second half and limited Hearts' chances. We were very unlucky with the outcome. \\"Our front four all did really well when we got the ball to them. They made things happen. I was going to take Chris [Erskine] off, but I thought he maybe had a goal in him or an assist late on. \\"If the window shuts [without making signings], it's not the end of the world, because there are still good players out there. But I'd like to get at least one in before then.\\" Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson: \\"We brought on [Jamie] Walker and Bjorn [Johnsen] to give us a lift, because we had an idea of the scores from other games. \\"[Strength in depth] is a huge advantage for us. So to have the option of changing it during the match like we did makes a huge difference. \\"You saw the quality of Tony Watt at the end.

Doing taxes typically involves compiling various financial statements, calculating income and deductions, and ensuring that all relevant paperwork is in order. This process can be both time-consuming and frustrating, especially if errors are discovered that require starting over. In contrast, the other possible answers seem less likely when considering the context. Working on a project for one's job or a child's project would likely involve more collaboration and communication between the two individuals, whereas the described scenario seems to imply a more solitary and focused effort.

In the town of Glipforg, Lem is a teenager with a new part-time job at the local planetarium and a long-time crush on his neighbor, Neera. His best friend is Skiff, a big fan of the Humaniacs films. Lem tries to ask Neera on a date, but her hippie friend, Glar, keeps interrupting with his protest songs. A mysterious spacecraft goes into orbit around Planet 51 and sends out a signal. On Planet 51, under a secret Army installation called Base 9 (their version of Area 51), there is a basement filled with Earth artifacts including robotic satellites launched by the United States and the Soviet Union. The spacecraft's signal activates Rover, a wheeled A.I. probe. Rover escapes, following a program to locate the newly arrived astronaut. The Planetary Army becomes suspicious after Rover's escape and begins to investigate. The spacecraft touches down in Lem's backyard; NASA astronaut Charles \\"Chuck\\" T. Baker emerges. As Chuck plants the United States flag, he steps on a \\"rubber ducky\\" someone left on the ground. Everyone stares, and Chuck tries to get back into his module. Shocked when he realizes he is on an inhabited planet, Chuck runs about wildly and hides at the planetarium as the Army arrives on the scene. Planetary Army General Grawl consults Professor Kipple about the \\"alien invader\\". The Army quarantines the area and asks citizens to start a local civil defense force to prevent the citizens from becoming \\"zombies\\". At the planetarium, Lem discovers Chuck's hiding place.

When he was at Oxford he had been well known for concealing under a slightly rowdy exterior the highest spirits of any of the undergraduates. He was looked upon as the most fascinating of _farceurs_. It seems that he had distinguished himself there less for writing Greek verse, though he was good at it, than for the wonderful variety of fireworks that he persistently used to let off under the dean's window. It was this fancy of his that led, first, to his popularity, and afterwards to the unfortunate episode of his being sent down; soon after which he had married privately, chiefly in order to send his parents an announcement of his wedding in _The Morning Post_, as a surprise. Some people had come in after dinner--for there was going to be a little _sauterie intime_, as Mrs Mitchell called it, speaking in an accent of her own, so appalling that, as Vincy observed, it made it sound quite improper. Edith watched, intensely amused, as she saw that there were really one or two people present who, never having seen Mitchell before, naturally did not recognise him now, so that the disguise was considered a triumph. There was something truly agreeable in the deference he was showing to a peculiarly yellow lady in red, adorned with ugly real lace, and beautiful false hair.

By calling the newspaper, he could bring attention to these issues and potentially initiate a public discourse that could lead to a better understanding of the case. 2. Support or protection for the anesthesiologist: The person's kneejerk reaction was to defend the anesthesiologist, indicating that there may be compelling reasons to believe that the anesthesiologist was being unfairly criticized or blamed. The father may have wanted to contact the newspaper to provide support or to present information that would protect the anesthesiologist's reputation and career. 3. Highlighting potential injustices or shortcomings in the system: The father may have felt that the case involving the anesthesiologist exposed flaws in the healthcare system or regulatory processes. By bringing the situation to the attention of the newspaper, he could be advocating for broader changes and improvements that could prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. 4. Emotional or personal connection to the parties involved: The father may have been personally or emotionally affected by the situation involving the anesthesiologist, either because of a connection to the anesthesiologist, the patient, or someone else involved in the case. In this situation, contacting the newspaper could stem from a desire to express his emotions or to impact the narrative surrounding the event. 5. Dissatisfaction or disagreement with media coverage: The father may have felt that the newspaper's coverage of the incident was biased, incomplete, or misleading. By contacting the newspaper, he could express his dissatisfaction or disagreement and potentially push for more accurate or fair reporting. In summary, although the specific context surrounding the anesthesiologist and the incident in question is not provided in the text, the father's desire to call the newspaper could stem from numerous motivations, including seeking clarification, defending the anesthesiologist, advocating for systemic changes, expressing personal connections, or critiquing media coverage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Given the fact that: The density of the atmosphere decreases with an increase in the height above sea level (altitude). Answer the question: Yolanda moved to Denver where it is 5000 feet above sea level. The atmosphere here is considered dense or thin? A:","completion":"Yolanda moved to Denver, a city situated at an elevation of approximately 5,000 feet (1,524 meters) above sea level. To ascertain whether the atmosphere in Denver is dense or thin, let's begin by understanding the concept of atmospheric density and how it is impacted by altitude. Atmospheric density can be defined as the mass of air per unit volume. The Earth's atmosphere consists of various gases, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases like argon and carbon dioxide. In general, air density is directly influenced by air pressure, temperature, and humidity. As altitude increases, both air pressure and temperature decrease, which subsequently leads to a reduction in air density. At sea level, the atmospheric pressure is approximately 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi), and the atmospheric density is at its highest point. As altitude increases, pressure decreases due to the reduced weight of the atmosphere above that specific location. Additionally, temperature decreases as altitude increases because of the lapse rate, which is the rate at which the temperature decreases as a function of increasing altitude. Now, considering Yolanda's relocation to Denver, which is located 5,000 feet above sea level, the atmosphere will undoubtedly be thinner than at sea level. At this altitude, the atmospheric pressure is lower, which results in a decreased air density compared to that at sea level. This reduction in air density is one of the reasons people who are new to such altitudes may initially experience altitude sickness or feel short of breath. To summarize, the atmosphere in Denver, 5,000 feet above sea level, can be considered thinner compared to the atmosphere at sea level due to the decreasing air density that occurs at higher altitudes. This is a result of decreasing air pressure and temperature as altitude increases. For Yolanda, breathing might feel slightly more difficult than at lower altitudes, and it could take her some time to acclimate to the thinner atmosphere in Denver."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A big shout out to the Yelpers - they were on the money with this place. There are alot of things to love about this pub - first is the ambience. From the dark wooden panels on the wall to the true Irish transplants serving you, it give this establishment a feel of authenticity. The video poker area is well cordoned off from the pub and hence relatively smoke free. We ordered a plate of their fish and chips and an Irish steak and mushroom pie (which takes 20 minutes but is worth the wait, my friends). While we were waiting, a neighbouring table were served their orders of fish. The reassuring crunch as they dug in signalled that McMullans ain't messing around when it comes to their food. When our fish and chips arrived, we were surprised at the substantial portion (perhaps we would order the appy sized portion next time). Three large fillets perched on top of a mountain of fries with some coleslaw and tartar sauce. Perfect. The plate was also free of grease which was another good sign. The fish was in a beer-battered style and had a perfect ratio of batter to fillet. The batter was light, crispy and held up well despite all the dunking into various sauces. Best of all - it wasn't oily. The chips were mid-sized cut and crispy. Overall, they held their texture pretty well with the passage of time. The coleslaw was pretty standard fare. The tartar sauce, though, needed a little tartness and sweetness but was okay. The steak and mushroom pie was a wonder. The flaky dome arrived at the table accompanied by a mound of mashed potatoes and buttered peas. The filling was a satisfying combination of beef and mushrooms, stewed with some kind of flavourful ?beer. The most amazing thing was the pastry. At first we thought the pie was in a ramikin but it was completely freestanding - that really speaks to the robustness of the crust. The pastry was flaky and crisp all the way around (including the bottom which normally tends to get soggy). McMullens has truly perfected the art of the Irish pie. The mashed potatoes were solid - had a nice flavour and a great gravy but could have used a little more texture. The buttered peas were good. Overall, with these pub favourites done so well plus some rather interesting Irish beer and whiskey flights at affordable prices, this is the place to go for some Irish comfort. Is this review positive or negative?","completion":"This review is predominantly positive. The reviewer praises the ambience, authenticity, food quality, and portions at the pub.

Are both Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf from critics of artistic works? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, both Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf can be considered critics of artistic works, although their focus, background, and contributions to the field vary significantly. Pauline Kael (1919-2001) was an American film critic who wrote for various publications, most notably The New Yorker magazine. She was known for her passionate, witty, and often controversial reviews, which significantly influenced the field of film criticism. Kael was a strong advocate for intelligent, personal, and subjective criticism and was highly influential among both critics and filmmakers. Her distinctive style made her a prominent figure in the world of arts criticism, and her work includes several best-selling books, including \\"I Lost It at the Movies\\" (1965), \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" (1968), and \\"Deeper into Movies\\" (1973). Christa Wolf (1929-2011), on the other hand, was a distinguished German writer, critic, and essayist, primarily known for her novels and literary works. Although not primarily considered an arts critic, Wolf's insightful essays, criticism, and authorial social commentary often touched upon artistic and intellectual themes, as well as the political and historical context in which art is created and received. Some of her most notable works, like \\"The Quest for Christa T.\\" (1968) or \\"Cassandra\\" (1983), are both heavily influenced by and serve as a critical analysis of the impact social values have on artistic expression. The intersection of literature, art, and politics is a significant theme in her works, and her sharp analysis can be seen as a form of art criticism in a broader sense. In conclusion, both Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf can be considered critics of artistic works, albeit with distinct approaches and focus areas. While Kael was an influential film critic with a direct and specific impact on the development of film criticism, Wolf was a renowned writer and essayist whose works often explored and critiqued artistic and intellectual themes within a broader socio-political context. Ultimately, both individuals contributed immensely to the understanding and appreciation of artistic expression and its role in society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does 'empty' space have mass which is displaced by the particles of matter which exist in it and move through it? Is 'empty' space filled with massive particles which are displaced by the particles of matter which exist in it and move through it? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"The two questions seem similar at first glance, but they actually inquire about different aspects of the nature of space and the presence of particles within it. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we will address both questions individually and compare them in the end. Question 1: Does 'empty' space have mass which is displaced by the particles of matter which exist in it and move through it? The current understanding of space is deeply rooted in the framework of General Relativity, which was introduced by Albert Einstein in 1915. According to this theory, space and time are combined into a continuum known as spacetime, and matter and energy curve spacetime, causing the effects we perceive as gravity. It is essential to understand that 'empty' space is not a substance or an object with mass that can be displaced by other matter. The very presence of matter dictates the geometry of spacetime, and it determines the paths of motion for objects within the vicinity. In recent decades, research has suggested that 'empty' space is not entirely empty. The concept of vacuum energy associated with quantum field theory tells us that even in the absence of particles, fields (such as electromagnetic fields and other fundamental fields) still exist in space. These fields contain energy, which contributes to the overall mass–energy equivalence through Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2. However, vacuum energy is distinct from the presence of a substance with mass that can be displaced by other particles. Question 2: Is 'empty' space filled with massive particles which are displaced by the particles of matter which exist in it and move through it? This question seems to inquire about the potential presence of particles within 'empty' space that could be displaced by other particles of matter. As mentioned earlier, physicists have discovered that space can not be considered as truly \\"empty,\\" given the quantum field theory's explanations. It is primarily assumed that there are usually no massive particles (particles with mass) occupying such a hypothetical 'empty' space, at least in a classical sense. However, particles can spontaneously appear and disappear at the quantum scale within a vacuum due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle states that we cannot know the exact position and momentum (mass times velocity) of a particle simultaneously. In extreme cases, the uncertainty principle allows for particles-antiparticles pairs to be created and annihilated within a short time duration. Although these appear in the quantum vacuum, they are not considered to be \\"displaced\\" by other particles, as their appearance and disappearance are fleeting and unrelated to the motion or presence of conventional matter. Comparison: In summary, these two questions probe different aspects of the nature of 'empty' space. The first question focuses on whether empty space has mass, and the answer is that it does not have mass in a conventional sense, but quantum theories reveal the presence of energy in 'empty' space due to fields suffused throughout it. The second question highlights whether there are massive particles in empty space that are displaced by other particles. Although empty space is not filled with massive particles in the classical sense, it is worth noting the fleeting appearance and disappearance of particle-antiparticle pairs due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. However, these transient quantum events are not displaced by regular matter. Overall, both questions touch on the complex concept of space and its contents, with each focusing on different aspects under the broad umbrella of mass, energy, and particles in so-called 'empty' space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process is the egg hatching to form a larva, also known as a caterpillar. To elaborate further on the entire butterfly life cycle, here is a more detailed description of each stage: 1. Egg: The life cycle of a butterfly starts when a female butterfly lays her eggs on a suitable plant, called the host plant. The eggs are usually laid on leaves or stems, depending on the preference of the butterfly species. The eggs can be small, and their shapes and colors can vary. The mother butterfly selects a suitable host plant to provide the appropriate food and safe environment for her offspring's growth and survival. 2. Larva (Caterpillar): Once the egg hatches, a small caterpillar emerges, which is the larval stage of a butterfly's life cycle. The caterpillar has one main task: to eat and grow. Caterpillars consume the host plant's leaves to obtain the nutrients required for growth. As a caterpillar grows, it undergoes a process called molting, where it sheds its skin several times to accommodate its expanding body. 3. Pupa (Chrysalis): After reaching its maximum size, the caterpillar turns itself into a chrysalis, or pupa. It does this by finding a safe spot where it can securely attach, usually using silk to create a firm anchor. The caterpillar's body then becomes covered in a hardened shell called the chrysalis. Inside the chrysalis, a transformation process called metamorphosis begins. 4. Metamorphosis: During metamorphosis, the caterpillar's body undergoes a remarkable transformation where its tissues break down and reform into the structure of the adult butterfly. This process can take from a few days to several weeks or even months, depending on the species. 5. Adult Butterfly: Once metamorphosis is complete, the adult butterfly, with its colorful wings, emerges from the chrysalis. Initially, its wings are soft and folded, but as the butterfly pumps blood into the wing veins, they expand and become more rigid. The adult butterfly then takes flight, ready to start the cycle anew by finding a mate and reproducing. In summary, the first step in the butterfly's life cycle is the hatching of the egg to form a larva, commonly known as a caterpillar. The entire process is a fascinating example of nature's adaptability and design."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Youth alienation in the late 1960's, from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious theme of \\"Zabriskie Point\\". Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin had much acting experience, a fact that actually enhances the film's message. Having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism, as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them. This is not a script-driven film. Except for the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual, with stunning cinematography. The beautiful naturalistic images seem other-worldly, and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of Mark and Daria. I would have replaced the thematically weak Pink Floyd music with the more cogent music of The Doors. Many scenes cry out for \\"Riders On The Storm\\". Even so, I like this film. It's different; it's unique; it is artistic and imaginative. And the desert badlands are beautiful. As the years go by, \\"Zabriskie Point\\" seems more and more attractive. It conveys the mood of the late 1960's in America. It is amazingly artistic, in a bohemian sort of way. And the film's last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing.

Uranium ore is mined in several ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and borehole mining (see uranium mining). Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.

He is told off by the dean (Paul Stanton), as he does not want to know anything about history or how buildings were built in the past; he is only interested in the modern possibilities of building. That forces the dean to take the matter on his own hands and expel him. But Roark has already decided that he wants to work for only one person: Henry Cameron (Henry Hull). Even Peter Keating (Ken Smith), his fellow student and good friend, advises him not to follow that career path, as Cameron was a renown architect thirty years before, but these days he is a finished man. Howard does not listen. He is admitted by Cameron because of the project he has designed, although Cameron himself tells him that he will be finished like him in a few years. Cameron recognises Roark's talents and hires him.Some years later, Cameron is making a scene of himself at the train station. He's drunk and buying copies of the yellow-press newspaper The Banner just to tear its pages away. The newsboy (Bob Alden) does not know what to do about it. A police officer (Paul Newlan) appears and is about to arrest him. Roark kindly takes him to their office. Cameron is a broken man: back at the office, he picks up a t-square and thrusts it into a window pane; then, he has a fit and passes out on the floor. Roark goes with him to hospital in an ambulance. There, Cameron knows he's about to die, and he makes Roark promise that he will burn every document Cameron has.

Project A has small volume of data, but project B and project C has large volume of data. He applied Fast Infoset format for project B, but didn't apply that format for project C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would project C have higher or lower access times compared to project A? The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information given in the paragraph: 1. Bob works for a data storage company and has three projects A, B, and C. 2. All projects involve storing XML data. 3. Project A has a small volume of data. 4. Project B and C have large volumes of data. 5. Bob applied Fast Infoset format to project B but not project C. Fast Infoset is a binary encoding format that optimizes the processing and storage of XML data by reducing its size. This can lead to faster access times compared to when the XML data is stored in its original, larger format. Since Project A has a small volume of data, its access times should be relatively fast compared to larger volumes of data. Project B, which has a large volume of data, could potentially have faster access times than project A due to the use of Fast Infoset format. However, for project C, Fast Infoset format was not applied to its large volume of XML data. This means that project C could have slower access times compared to project B, as it will be in the traditional, larger XML format. Based on the information given, project C would likely have higher access times compared to project A. The reason being that project A has a small volume of data, meaning faster access times, while project C has a large volume of data without the optimization from the Fast Infoset format."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit.

When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career. His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings \\"a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line.\\"Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his RCA Victor recordings with the Boston Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras;...

The name Proterozoic comes from Greek and means \\"earlier life\\", the Greek root protero-,means \\"former, earlier\\" and zoic-, means \\"animal, living being\\". The Proterozoic Eon extended from to (million years ago), and is the most recent part of the Precambrian Supereon. It is subdivided into three geologic eras (from oldest to youngest): the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic. The well-identified events of this eon were the transition to an oxygenated atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic; several glaciations, which produced the hypothesized Snowball Earth during the Cryogenian Period in the late Neoproterozoic Era; and the Ediacaran Period (635 to 541 Ma) which is characterized by the evolution of abundant soft-bodied multicellular organisms and provides us with the first obvious fossil evidence of life on earth. - Laurentia or the North American Craton is a large continental craton that forms the ancient geological core of the North American continent. Many times in its past, Laurentia has been a separate continent as it is now in the form of North America, although originally it also included the cratonic areas of Greenland and also the northwestern part of Scotland, known as the Hebridean Terrane. During other times in its past, Laurentia has been part of larger continents and supercontinents and itself consists of many smaller terranes assembled on a network of Early Proterozoic orogenic belts. Small microcontinents and oceanic islands collided with and sutured onto the ever-growing Laurentia, and together formed the stable Precambrian craton seen today. - Baltica was a late-Proterozoic, early-Palaeozoic continent that now includes the East European craton of northwestern Eurasia. Baltica was created as an entity not earlier than 1.8 billion years ago. Before this time, the three segments/continents that now compose the East European craton were in different places on the globe. Baltica existed on a tectonic plate called the Baltic Plate. - Nena was an ancient minor supercontinent that consisted of the cratons of Arctica , Baltica , and East Antarctica . Nena formed about 1.8 billion years ago but became part of the global supercontinent Columbia around 1.1 billions of years ago . - In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain. - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions. - The Precambrian (or Pre-Cambrian, sometimes abbreviated p) is the earliest period of Earth's history, set before the current Phanerozoic Eon. The Precambrian (colored green on the right) is a supereon that is subdivided into three eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic) of the geologic time scale. It spans from the formation of Earth about 4.567 billion years ago (Ga) to the beginning of the Cambrian Period, about million years ago (Ma), when hard-shelled creatures first appeared in abundance. The Precambrian is so named because it preceded the Cambrian, the first period of the Phanerozoic eon, which is named after Cambria, the Latinised name for Wales, where rocks from this age were first studied. The Precambrian accounts for 89% of geologic time. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'nena ' with the relationship of 'temporal range start'.

Soak up as much of the excess liquid as you can on the mattress by blotting it with a clean towel or cloth. Blot the liquid until there is very little left on the surface of the mattress. Do not rub the mattress to remove the liquid, as this will just make the liquid absorb more into the mattress. Take a few teaspoons of baking soda and sprinkle it on the mattress. Let it sit on the mattress for a few minutes. The baking soda will help to absorb any remaining liquid on the mattress and remove odor. After the baking soda has been on the mattress for a few minutes, vacuum it up. Use an all-purpose cleaner for fabric on the mattress. You can also make your own cleaner by combining one part warm water and one part white vinegar. Spray the cleaner on the mattress and let it sit for three to five minutes. Make sure you cover all of the wet areas on the mattress with the cleaner. You can apply several layers of the cleaner to the mattress if the smell is strong. Use a dry towel or cloth to blot the mattress once the cleaner has been absorbed. Blot the entire mattress well. This will prevent mold in the mattress and ensure the mattress is as dry as possible. Sprinkle the mattress one more time with the baking soda. Then, let the mattress air dry for at least 18 hours. This will ensure the mattress has time to completely dry. You may need to sleep somewhere else for the night if you were planning on sleeping on the mattress. Do not try to sleep on the mattress until it is completely dry. Once the mattress has time to dry, use a vacuum to clean up the baking soda. You can then put the mattress outside or in an area with good ventilation in your home. This will allow any remaining smell to fade away. Touch the mattress to confirm it is dry before you use it again. You can also smell the mattress to confirm the smell is gone. Summary:","completion":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to remove excess liquid from a mattress using blotting techniques, baking soda, and a homemade cleaning solution, followed by vacuuming, air drying, and ventilating to ensure a dry, odor-free mattress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I can use this background: Shad are also valued as a sport fish that exhibit complex and little-understood feeding behavior while spawning. Unlike salmon, shad retain the ability to digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, their feeding instinct can be triggered by a variety of factors such as turbidity and water temperature. Anglers use both spinning and fly fishing tackle to pursue shad. Spin fisherman use a shad dartjig or a flutter spoon. Some anglers use a downrigger to place the artificial lure at the desired depth and location. This is usually in the channel, or deepest part of the river. Migrating shad tend to occupy the lower portion of the water column which makes this the typical depth of choice for fishing. In the North, April through June is when shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries once water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions typically improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases. Now, I have a new situation: Jeff loves to go shad fishing. He prefers using fly fishing tackle and is planning a fishing trip up North with his buddies. They decided to take their trip in May when everyone can get off work over the Memorial Day holiday. Sam enjoys shad fishing as well, but the only time he and his buddies are able to take off work is during their slow season in March. Answer this question please: Who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam? A:","completion":"Sam will likely have worse fishing conditions and catch less shad on his fishing trip as compared to Jeff. This is because Sam and his buddies are planning their fishing trip in March, which is earlier than the optimal shad fishing season in the North. The shad primarily spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries from April through June when water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions generally improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases. Since Sam is planning his trip in March before the peak spawning season, the chances of catching shad will be lower due to cooler water temperatures and potentially higher water flow. On the other hand, Jeff and his friends have planned their trip over the Memorial Day holiday in May, which falls within the optimal shad fishing season in the North. With warmer water temperatures and reduced water flow, they are more likely to experience better fishing conditions, thus increasing their chances of catching more shad. In conclusion, Sam, who is planning his fishing trip in March, is more likely to encounter worse fishing conditions and catch less shad as compared to Jeff, who has planned his trip during the prime shad fishing season in May."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two groups of soldiers started different training programs. Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group didn't increase the size of their muscles? Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the Brown group did not increase the size of their muscles. This is because they were running, which primarily focuses on the cardiac muscle, increasing its strength and efficiency rather than the size of their skeletal muscles. The Blue group, on the other hand, did weight training, which involved the contraction of skeletal muscles against a resisting force, leading to an increase in muscle size and strength."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The term originates from the French word for \\"raw\\" in the term used by Le Corbusier to describe his choice of material béton brut (raw concrete). British architectural critic Reyner Banham adapted the term into \\"brutalism\\" (originally \\"New Brutalism\\") to identify the emerging style. - Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, known as Le Corbusier (October 6, 1887 August 27, 1965), was a Swiss-French architect, designer, painter, urban planner, writer, and one of the pioneers of what is now called modern architecture.

Which British Prime Minister is buried in Spynie churchyard, Lossiemouth?","completion":"Ramsay MacDonald, the first-ever Labour Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is buried in Spynie Churchyard, Lossiemouth. Born on October 12, 1866, in Lossiemouth, Moray, Scotland, James Ramsay MacDonald rose to prominence as a key political figure in the UK and served as Prime Minister in two separate occasions. Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister in 1924, although his government only lasted for ten months. His second term occurred in 1929 when the Labour Party won the general election. However, the Great Depression struck that year, which created various challenges for his administration. His response to the depression led to a split in the Labour Party, and MacDonald eventually formed a National Government with members of other political parties. As a result, he served as Prime Minister until 1935, when his health began to decline. Eventually, Stanley Baldwin succeeded MacDonald as Prime Minister. Throughout his career, Ramsay MacDonald was a strong advocate for peace and diplomacy. He supported the League of Nations and took various steps towards disarmament during his time in office. He also aimed to reduce poverty and unemployment through several welfare initiatives and educational reforms. After retiring from politics, MacDonald passed away on November 9, 1937, while on vacation aboard the ocean liner RMS Reina del Pacifico. He was brought back to Lossiemouth, where he was laid to rest in Spynie Churchyard. This burial site has since become a place of historical significance and pays tribute to the life and contributions of the United Kingdom's first Labour Prime Minister."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: These additions may have made sense when they were made, but their cumulative effect has been to create a government in which many agencies cannot say just what business they are in. Sentence 2: Government agencies can always declare what they do. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"In order to assess the compatibility of these two sentences, let's break them down: Sentence 1 states that there are some cases where government agencies cannot clearly declare what their role or function is. This statement is presented as a result of certain historical decisions which, over time, have complicated the purpose and function of many such agencies. Sentence 2, on the contrary, asserts that government agencies can always declare what they do. Analyzing these two sentences side-by-side, it would appear that they contradict each other. While Sentence 1 suggests that there are circumstances that prevent agencies from being able to state their role or purpose clearly, Sentence 2 implies that there are no such circumstances and that agencies can always clearly state their function. Therefore, if Sentence 1 is considered to be true, Sentence 2 cannot be true: it contradicts the established condition that agencies may sometimes not be able to clarify their roles due to certain cumulative decisions. Since the two sentences present opposing arguments, the truth of the first sentence means the second sentence is/would be false."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Greenware ceramics made from celadon had been made in the area since the 3rd-century Jin dynasty, but it returned to prominence—particularly in Longquan—during the Southern Song and Yuan. Longquan greenware is characterized by a thick unctuous glaze of a particular bluish-green tint over an otherwise undecorated light-grey porcellaneous body that is delicately potted. Yuan Longquan celadons feature a thinner, greener glaze on increasingly large vessels with decoration and shapes derived from Middle Eastern ceramic and metalwares. These were produced in large quantities for the Chinese export trade to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and (during the Ming) Europe. By the Ming, however, production was notably deficient in quality. It is in this period that the Longquan kilns declined, to be eventually replaced in popularity and ceramic production by the kilns of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi. Question: What were greenware ceramics made from?","completion":"Greenware ceramics were made from celadon, a type of high-quality pottery characterized by a specific glazing technique. This technique involved applying an unctuous glaze with a distinct bluish-green tint, giving the ceramics a unique appearance. Celadon greenware ceramics originated from China during the 3rd-century Jin dynasty and regained prominence in the Longquan region during the Southern Song and Yuan dynasties. The base material for these ceramics was a light-grey porcellaneous clay body that was delicately potted. Over time, Longquan celadon greenware ceramics evolved in their design, incorporating features from Middle Eastern ceramics and metalwares. They were largely produced for export to markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

UPDATED:. 09:45 EST, 19 February 2013. Montana's lawmakers have passed a bill allowing people to salvage and eat roadkill in a bid to 'stop good food going to waste'. House Bill 247 creates permits allowing individuals to scrape game animals off the road, including antelope, deer, elk or moose. The measure passed 19-2 last week in the House and is now set to be considered by the state Senate. State Representative Steve Lavin, a supporter of the bill, said: 'People hit a lot of. animals on roadways, and I mean a ton of them. There’s a. lot of good meat being wasted out there.' Mr Lavin said animals like this bull elk will not be targeted because people will not want to damage their cars. 'When people first hear about it — roadkill — some of them think this is a crazy bill, but it’s not,' Mr Lavin told the Daily Inter Lake. Officials at Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks are concerned potentially valuable carcasses, such as those of Bighorn sheep,. might be targeted for profit. Mr Lavin disputed this. He added: 'People aren’t going to intentionally. hit an elk when it’s going to cost them 1,500 in damages to their. vehicle. Nor are poachers going to go through the problems. of staging a road kill with the possibility of being caught. If there’s something fishy going on, we’ll catch on pretty quickly,' Lavin added.

The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the person whose march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 men?, using the article: When Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323 BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction of poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this. With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 – 317 BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 – 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army.A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Journalism and national security have survived decades of lies; both can handle a little unexpected truth. Giving government secrets and classified documents to a nation's enemies or even its allies is certainly against the law. We've always called it spying. Now the equation is changed and people who approve giving purloined documents to the wide electronic world call it transparency. Others, who oppose WikiLeaks' release of diplomatic cables Sunday, are calling it an act of terrorism to be met with full government sanctions. The sober side of me knows that putting the entire archive of a quarter-million State Department documents online can be harmful and potentially dangerous for national security. Yet the news reader -- the citizen -- in me also finds it immensely satisfying to learn what government leaders are really saying compared with the official statements, releases and communiqués that often masquerade as government information. Knowing that Saudi leaders, behind a false front of regional solidarity, are fretting about Iran seems a bit refreshing. I do appreciate knowing that our DEA knows that an Afghan vice president visited the United Arab Emirates last year carrying 52 million in cash. Even if I feel chagrined that our diplomats are getting blackmailed by other nations into taking Guantanamo Bay prisoners off our hands, I'd rather know the truth than the pretend explanations. The real danger, it seems to me, is not the revelation of assorted classified material but our tendency to overreact, either to actual security threats such as the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber or, in this case, to a massive information dump. We've become so reactive to security concerns -- and, at the same time, apathetic to threats to our own civil liberties -- that we might, as a result of the WikiLeaks release, allow government agencies to step on the universal reach of the Internet or find ways to create exceptions to First Amendment freedoms. Official ire may be aimed at WikiLeaks and its founder, but there's a real current of anger at the media for providing a printed and organized outlet for these documents. Without the printed media, however, the information would be presented in such a helter-skelter fashion, it would be difficult to analyze or even know what is true and which documents are bogus. Since the earlier two massive releases by WikiLeaks of low-level Defense Department documents relating to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, I have yet to find a person who has actually read more than a tiny sampling of the actual leaked documents. Many say the electronic information age has done away with traditional or mainstream journalism, but here it is evident that the journalists at The New York Times, The Guardian, Germany's Der Spiegel magazine and the Spanish daily El Pais are still doing the legwork -- sifting through information, confirming, editing and presenting it to the public. Over many weeks, the above publications have also cooperated with their governments and with WikiLeaks in vetting the material and removing information that clearly might be harmful to people in other countries. We all understand how illegal it is to reveal state secrets, even those that are classified secret for no good reason. We also know that over the years, governments have lied to the American people in the name of national security, whether about preparations for war or dealings with our allies and enemies. Journalists take comfort in the saying about sunlight being the best disinfectant, and usually that is true. Abraham Lincoln expressed the same sentiment this way: \\"Let the people know the facts and the country will be safe.\\" I know there is risk in having these illegally obtained insights into government discussions and calculations, but we should not allow others to use this to attack a free media or to create more government secrecy. During a conversation with my journalism class on the WikiLeaks controversy yesterday, the graduate students considered both overreactions as potential dangers -- that these leaks will provide an excuse to curtail our constitutional freedoms and that government will become even more duplicitous. And that would be a real crime. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy McNulty.

Q: Review: Like many Americans, I was first introduced to the works of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw \\"Spirited Away.\\" I fell in love with the film and have seen it many times. Now I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki. One of his earlier works is \\"Castle in the Sky.\\" Although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as \\"Spirited Away\\" (though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair).A young boy named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, Pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city.Going into a film by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki. Watching a film by Miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood.Because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words. It also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors. The voice acting is varied. James Van Der Beek fares best. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta. She's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska. He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything to get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola. Leachman may have won an Oscar for \\"The Last Picture Show,\\" but she's annoying as the pirate leader. Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. It's so bad it nearly ruins the film! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast as the general.I would definitely recommend seeing \\"Castle in the Sky.\\" I'll probably end up buying it myself.

He also bought other fruit that he plans to eat fresh. He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruit have a higher sugar content candied ginger or fresh apples? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","completion":"Candied ginger has a higher sugar content than fresh apples. This is because the process of candying fruit involves placing the fruit in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it.

Humans, birds, and goats have olfactory receptors in their noses that allow them to detect various chemicals and scents in the environment. However, these species are not part of the amphibian class, making them less suited as an answer to this particular question. Similarly, worms and slugs have chemosensory structures that enable them to detect chemicals in their surroundings. Worms have specialized cells known as chemoreceptor cells that are concentrated in their anterior end, while slugs possess sensory tentacles that contain chemoreceptor cells. Despite their ability to sense chemicals, these organisms are not amphibians, making the choice of frogs the best answer to the question at hand. Lastly, the answer choice \\"nose\\" refers to the sense organ itself, rather than an organism that possesses such organs. Therefore, it is not an appropriate answer to the question as it does not provide information about a specific animal that has sense organs to smell and taste chemicals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Force 10 from Navarone Movie plot: In 1943, after their successful mission on the Greek island of Navarone, Major Keith Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Sergeant John Miller (Edward Fox) are sent to find and kill Nicolai. Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane. On the ground, the survivors run across a group they believe to be their allies, Communist Yugoslav Partisans, led by Captain Drazak (Richard Kiel). Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air.

Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

The definition of a common subsequence is a sequence of elements that appear in both lists in the same order but not necessarily consecutively. First, we can create a two-dimensional array (table) with the size (len(A)+1) x (len(B)+1) to store the lengths of common subsequences. We'll initialize all the elements in the first row and the first column with 0, as there's no common subsequence for an empty list. Then, we'll iterate over both lists starting from index 1. For each element in list A and each element in list B, we'll compare them: - If the elements are the same, it means we found a common element for the subsequence, we add 1 to the corresponding cell from the previous diagonal cell (the length of the common subsequence so far). For example, if A[i] == B[j], we can update the table as table[i][j] = table[i-1][j-1] + 1. - If the elements are not the same, we'll take the maximum value between the element from the immediate left cell and the element from the immediate upper cell. If A[i] != B[j], we can update the table as table[i][j] = max(table[i-1][j], table[i][j-1]). After iterating over both lists, the last element in the table (table[len(A)][len(B)]) contains the length of the longest common subsequence. To find the actual subsequence, we can backtrack from this last element in the table to find the elements that were part of the common subsequence.

As the robbery unfolds, Detective Callahan finds himself racing against the clock to stop the thieves before they can make their escape with millions of dollars in tow. Along the way, he stumbles upon a conspiracy that extends far beyond petty theft – something that threatens the entire town and its residents, revealing a web of corruption, deceit, and betrayal. With help from a young, rebellious hacker named Lisa Montgomery, Jack successfully stops the bank robbery and uncovers the twisted agenda behind it, involving the bank's manager and an ambitious local politician. In the end, Callahan brings down the mastermind behind the scheme and saves the town, and Lisa proves to be a critical asset in solving the conspiracy. Despite his initial wish for a peaceful life in a small town, Jack realizes that the life of danger follows him wherever he goes. As he reconciles the reality of his situation, he finds solace in forming strong bonds with people like Lisa, who share his same passion for justice.

What is the answer they should choose between \\"a marble counter\\" and \\"cedar coffee table\\"? Logic test: A scientist is playing with a wind-up monkey when he notices that it goes faster over one surface than another. The surface with the most friction is (A) a marble countertop (B) a cedar coffee table A:","completion":"The answer your students should choose between \\"a marble counter\\" and \\"cedar coffee table\\" is (B) a cedar coffee table. Let me explain the logical reasoning behind this conclusion. Friction is the resisting force between two surfaces that are in contact when one or both of them are in motion. The amount of friction depends on the roughness of the surfaces and the normal force pushing them together. A wind-up monkey is a mechanical toy that moves due to the conversion of stored potential energy from winding a key. When released, the stored energy transforms into kinetic energy, making the monkey move. The toy moves by interacting with the surface it is placed on, and the friction between the toy's feet and the surface determine how quickly it moves. Now, let's consider the two given options: (A) A marble countertop: Marble is a metamorphic rock that is smooth and polished, generally used for decorative purposes and creating a shiny surface that can be easily cleaned. The polished surface of a marble countertop allows objects to slide smoothly across it. As a result, the friction between the wind-up monkey's feet and the marble surface is minimal. The low friction allows the monkey to move faster on the marble countertop. (B) A cedar coffee table: Cedar is a type of wood used in making furniture due to its durability and appearance. A wooden surface is generally rougher than a polished surface like marble, so it offers more resistance against the movement of an object placed on it. The cedar coffee table provides more friction between the wind-up monkey's feet and the wooden surface, causing the monkey to move slower. Since the logic test question asks for the surface with the most friction, the correct answer is (B) a cedar coffee table, as it offers more resistance and slows down the wind-up monkey compared to the marble countertop."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and...

(A). weak (B). stubby (C). elongated (D). short","completion":"C. elongated Jackrabbits' hind legs are elongated. These long legs are an adaptation that allows them to move quickly and cover large distances in their natural habitats. Jackrabbits, which are actually a type of hare, are known for their incredible speed and agility. They can reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour) when fleeing from predators. This speed is made possible by their powerful and elongated hind legs, which provide both strength and significant pushing force. These long legs also help jackrabbits make swift turns and change direction rapidly, allowing them to evade predators with ease. Additionally, their long legs enable them to leap large distances in a single bound, covering as much as 10 feet (3 meters) in a single jump. While their elongated legs are a crucial aspect of their adaptation to their environment, it is their large, elongated ears that help with heat dissipation. Jackrabbits commonly live in areas with hot and arid climates. In order to regulate their body temperature, they use their long ears to release excess heat, as the plentiful blood vessels in their ears aid in the dissipation of heat. This prevents them from overheating or losing too much water through perspiration. In summary, jackrabbits' hind legs are elongated, offering them exceptional speed, agility, and jumping abilities. This adaptation allows them to thrive in their natural habitats, where they may need to escape from various predators. At the same time, their long ears play a significant role in their ability to tolerate hot environments by effectively dissipating heat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: Fritz August Hoenig (1848 -- 1902) was a German officer and a military writer. Step 2: Compare the key information. Both sentences say that Fritz Hoenig, born in 1848 and died in 1902, was a German officer and a military writer. The difference between the two sentences is the inclusion of the middle name \\"August\\" in the second sentence. Step 3: Determine if the difference in information changes the meaning of the sentences. The addition of the middle name \\"August\\" in the second sentence provides additional information about Fritz Hoenig but doesn't change the overall meaning of the sentence.

Christmas has always been an exceptional time of love and tradition in the small town of Trapper Falls, Alaska. Hometown of Mayor Dan Reed looks forward to each year with enthusiasm to all the events, friends and family that fill this special season. Together with his brother Greg, they dedicate time away from their adventure tour company to drape the town is Christmas cheer. When Dan's old high school rival Mitch Bright, a mean-spirited and embittered militant atheist returns home after 20 years, Dan is immediately suspicious. Mitch is a highly successful big city lawyer who has never wanted anything to do with Trapper Falls.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which is this about? AP - An audiotape purportedly by key terror suspect Abu Musab al-Zarqawi boasts in an apparently recent recording that Islamic holy warriors have humiliated the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq.","completion":"This topic is about an audiotape, allegedly by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a key terror suspect who was a prominent figure in the Iraqi insurgency during the early to mid-2000s, and the content of the tape which boasts about the successes of the Islamic holy warriors against the U.S-led coalition in Iraq. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was the leader of an extremist group known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, which later evolved into the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Born in Jordan, al-Zarqawi emerged as a notorious figure in the world of terrorism, recruiting militants, planning and executing deadly attacks, and spreading his extremist ideology. The audiotape in question is an audio recording, which was reportedly made by al-Zarqawi himself, claiming that the Islamic holy warriors or Mujahideen have dealt significant blows to and humiliated the U.S-led coalition during the conflict in Iraq. This audiotape would have served as a form of propaganda for al-Zarqawi and his supporters in their battle against coalition forces and the newly established Iraqi government. The U.S-led coalition in Iraq was formed in 2003 following the U.S invasion of Iraq, toppling dictator Saddam Hussein. The coalition comprised of military forces from multiple countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, with the primary aim of dismantling the Ba'athist regime, restoring stability, and establishing a democratic government in Iraq. However, the invasion significantly disrupted Iraq's political and social structure, creating a power vacuum that various factions, including al-Zarqawi's group, sought to exploit. The audiotape's claim of the Islamic holy warriors humiliating the U.S-led coalition refers to various hits the coalition suffered during the course of the Iraq war, some of which can be attributed to actions by al-Zarqawi's group. These incidents include deadly bombings, ambushes, and kidnappings, aimed at undermining the coalition's efforts to maintain security and foster democracy in Iraq. The audiotape purportedly by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi would have been intended to bolster the morale of his followers, showcase their group’s strength to potential recruits and allies, and intimidate both Iraqi civilians and coalition forces. By making such claims, al-Zarqawi aimed to demonstrate the resilience and determination of his extremist group in their fight against the coalition and the Iraqi government. In conclusion, the topic revolves around an audiotape allegedly recorded by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a key terror suspect and leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, in which he boasts about the achievements of the Islamic holy warriors against the U.S-led coalition in Iraq. The audio recording serves as a form of propaganda, which has been utilized to establish and promote al-Zarqawi's extremist group's goals and mission and to motivate his followers to continue their violent struggle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer. - Kym Mazelle (born Kymberly Grigsby; August 10, 1960) is an American singer.

After the end of ELO in 1986, he founded ELO Part II. - The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970, by songwriters/multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood with drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of Beatlesque pop, classical arrangements, and futuristic iconography. After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's leader, arranging and producing every album while writing virtually all of their original material. - House music is a genre of electronic music created by club DJs and music producers that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s. Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Frankie Knuckles, Phuture, Kym Mazelle, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia. - Francis \\"Frankie\\" Nicholls (January 18, 1955 March 31, 2014), better known by his stage name Frankie Knuckles, was an American DJ, record producer and remixer. - Detroit is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United StatesCanada border.

It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings...

Select the topic that this about: Target can maintain its discount image while offering pricier services and merchandise.","completion":"Target Corporation, a popular American retail corporation, has established a solid reputation for offering affordable merchandise across numerous categories, including clothing, furniture, electronics, and more. However, maintaining a discount image while offering pricier services and merchandise is somewhat of a challenge for the retailer. To do so, Target can take various approaches to ensure that its image stays intact while also providing a range of more expensive products and services. 1. Differentiate merchandise selection: Target can offer both low-cost and high-end products concurrently by carefully segmenting and organizing merchandise into different categories. By clearly distinguishing between these categories, customers can easily recognize price points and differentiate between affordable options and luxury items. This distinction can help maintain the discount image of the retailer without alienating customers seeking pricier products. 2. Maintain the emphasis on value: Although the company might introduce upscale services and pricier merchandise, it is important for Target to continue focusing on providing value to its customers. This can be achieved by providing consistently high-quality products, offering excellent customer service, and delivering innovative and exclusive products. Additionally, the retailer can maintain price competitiveness by providing exclusive offers, time-limited discounts, and loyalty programs that reward customers for shopping at Target. 3. Introduce exclusive brands or collections: To reinforce its commitment to offering value to a broad range of customers, Target can introduce exclusive brands or product lines targeting specific niches, like luxury enthusiasts. For example, the company could collaborate with high-end designers or brands to create unique, limited edition collections. This strategy will help maintain the discount image while also catering to the needs of customers who crave pricier, premium products. 4. Enhance the in-store experience: To cater to a wider customer base seeking both discounted and pricier offerings, Target can improve the shopping experience within brick and mortar stores. For instance, the retailer can curate separate sections of the store for luxury goods and discounted items. Another strategy may involve developing personal shopping or concierge services for high-end customers. By enhancing the in-store experience, the company can cater to different customer segments while maintaining consistent branding. 5. Expand online offerings: Target can leverage its e-commerce platform to offer a more extensive selection of upscale products and services. By providing tailored online shopping experiences, the company can ensure customers have access to a full range of products, including luxury items, without diluting the retailer's discount image in physical stores. Furthermore, the online platform allows Target to monitor customer behavior and preferences, ensuring a better understanding of how to balance discount and luxury product lines. 6. Collaborate with online influencers and celebrities: To attract customers interested in pricier merchandise, Target can establish partnerships with well-known influencers or celebrities who endorse and promote the retailer's upscale product line. Influencer marketing is a powerful tool that can garner interest and build trust among potential customers. This collaboration can increase the visibility of Target's luxury offerings without undermining its reputation as a discount retailer. In conclusion, maintaining a discount image while offering pricier services and merchandise is achievable for Target with strategic planning and execution. By focusing on clear differentiation, delivering value, creating exclusive offerings, enhancing in-store experience, leveraging online presence, and collaborating with influential partners, Target can successfully cater to both discount and luxury-seeking consumers without negatively impacting its branding and reputation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices: a). yes b). no","completion":"b). no While the provided answer gives information about the lawsuit filed by Abigail Fisher and Rachel Multer Michalewicz and mentions the race-conscious policy, a more detailed and long answer would be necessary to fully address the question. A detailed and long answer to the provided question would be: In the lawsuit filed in 2012 by Abigail Fisher and Rachel Multer Michalewicz against the University of Texas, the plaintiffs claimed that the university had an unconstitutional admissions policy. They asserted that the University of Texas at Austin (UT) used a race-conscious policy in their undergraduate and law school admissions process, which violated their civil and constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs specifically alleged that the university's admissions policy, known as the Top Ten Percent Plan, unfairly considered the race and ethnicity of applicants as a factor in the decision-making process. This policy automatically guaranteed admission to any Texas high school students who graduated in the top 10% of their class, regardless of other factors. However, for the remaining available slots, the university considered race as one of the factors among others, such as grades, test scores, extracurricular activities, and community service, in an effort to promote diversity on campus. Fisher and Michalewicz argued that this race-conscious policy had a discriminatory impact on them as they were both denied admission to the University of Texas. They claimed that the university's consideration of race in the admissions process had given preferential treatment to minority applicants with lower qualifications than their own. In response, the University of Texas defended its admissions policy, maintaining that its use of race as a factor was permissible under the Supreme Court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), which upheld the constitutionality of considering race in college admissions as long as it is done in a narrowly tailored manner to achieve the educational benefits of diversity. UT also argued that the Top Ten Percent Plan was not sufficient to achieve the university's diversity goals and that the additional consideration of race in their holistic review process was necessary. The case went through several levels of the court system, ultimately reaching the U.S. Supreme Court twice. In 2013, the Supreme Court sent the case back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of the University of Texas. The case, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, returned to the Supreme Court in 2016, and the court upheld the university's race-conscious admissions policy, finding it constitutional in a 4-3 decision. The court's ruling emphasized that colleges and universities can consider race as one factor in a holistic admissions process, as long as they do so in a narrowly tailored way that meets the strict scrutiny standards set forth in Grutter v. Bollinger."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. CHAPTER X. ON DETACHMENT. Ralph was soon at home in the regiment.

Context: Life with My Sister Madonna, a book by Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted at number two on The New York Times bestseller list. The book caused some friction between Madonna and her brother, because of the unsolicited publication. Problems also arose between Madonna and Ritchie, with the media reporting that they were on the verge of separation. Ultimately, Madonna filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences, which was finalized in December 2008. She decided to adopt from Malawi. The country's High Court initially approved the adoption of Chifundo \\"Mercy\\" James; however, the application was rejected because Madonna was not a resident of the country. Madonna appealed, and on June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi granted Madonna the right to adopt Mercy James. She also released Celebration, her third greatest-hits album and final release with Warner. It contained the new songs \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Revolver\\" along with 34 hits spanning her career. Celebration reached number one in the UK, tying her with Elvis Presley as the solo act with most number one albums in the British chart history.

Answer the following question: Given the background: The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician Sydney Chapman in 1930. Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O3) photolysis produces O and O2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude (see temperature inversion); the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (−3°C or 26.6°F). This vertical stratification, with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular convection and associated turbulence in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms, may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the stratopause, above which the temperature decreases with height. and the situation: Barbara and Jane are two students. They both like meteorology. Barbara studies the formation of the ozone layer, while Jane studies about the stratosphere. Answer the following question: Which student learned more about temperature inversion? Answer:","completion":"Jane learned more about temperature inversion. This is because temperature inversion is a characteristic of the stratosphere, and Jane studies the stratosphere. While Barbara's study of the formation of the ozone layer may touch upon temperature inversion, it is not the primary focus of her study. In contrast, Jane's study of the stratosphere directly involves understanding temperature inversion as it is a key feature of that atmospheric layer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Against this backdrop, Tracy announces that she is running for student council president. Initially she is unopposed, as she is widely seen as the natural candidate for the job. When Tracy presents Mr. McAllister with her list of nominating signatures to qualify for the election ballot, she makes a remark about \\"working closely\\" together that he interprets as an indication she may try to seduce him. Perhaps annoyed by Tracy's presumptuousness, and/or concerned that he might give in to this seduction and share the same fate as his friend Dave, Mr. McAllister decides to persuade junior Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a slow-witted, but affable and popular football player to enter the race. Paul is unable to play football as he is recovering from a ski injury that resulted in his left leg being broken, and Mr. McAllister suggests a new way to explore his talents through student council. Although Paul is ambivalent at first, he agrees to run, much to Tracy's consternation. Meanwhile, Paul's adopted younger sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) is rejected by her romantic interest Lisa (Frankie Ingrassia), who dismisses their time together as \\"experimenting.\\" Lisa then engages in a passionate relationship with Paul. In retaliation, Tammy decides to run for school president as well. During a school assembly to hear the candidate's speeches, after Tracy only draws polite applause and Paul is barely able to read his...

This sentence is clear and grammatically correct, so I can begin the translation immediately. The English version of this sentence would be: \\"At this, there were approximately 100 participants, from all continents.\\" Justification: 1. \\"La acesta\\" translates to \\"At this\\". \\"La\\" is a preposition in Romanian, in this case indicating location, and \\"acesta\\" is a demonstrative pronoun meaning \\"this\\". 2. \\"au fost prezenţi\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"to be\\" (\\"fost\\" is \\"were\\") used with \\"prezenţi\\" which means \\"present\\", making the phrase translate to \\"were present\\". 3. \\"aproximativ\\" translates directly to \\"approximately\\". 4. \\"100 de participanţi,\\" is a numerical phrase, \\"100\\" is the same in English and Romanian, \\"de\\" means \\"of\\", and \\"participanţi\\" translates to \\"participants\\", so the whole phrase translates to \\"100 participants\\". 5.

Your job is to determine whether information from more than one term is needed to answer the question. Indicate your choice as \`a\` for Yes or \`b\` for No. Input: Question: Which of the countries that had revolution spread to them as a result of Nasser coming to power has the highest population? Passage:Following the defeat of Arab armies in the 1948 Palestine war, the Arab world went into an era of political assassinations and military coups that culminated in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which brought Gamal Abdel Nasser into the leadership of Egypt. Nasser's ascend to power was a turning point in the history of the region and the revolutionary wave had spread to Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Yemen and Libya. This wave however faced a historic defeat in the 1967 Arab–Israeli War. The author states that this defeat was worse than that of 1948 and had signaled the end of the Nasserite revolutionary wave, which was replaced by the Islamist wave. This wave reached its climax in early 1980s after the Islamic Revolution in Iran and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which turned Afghanistan into a hub for Mujahideen. The Arab revolutions that succeeded did not bring al-Nadha nor freedom, instead they had turned into authoritarian regimes. These developments and the 8-year Iran–Iraq War have struck a fatal blow to the Arab revolutionary wave of hope. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Understand the question that is given. Usage: In the given task, the sample question is \\"Which of the countries that had revolution spread to them as a result of Nasser coming to power has the highest population?\\".

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - A levee,, dike, dyke, embankment, floodbank or stopbank is an elongated naturally occurring ridge or artificially constructed fill or wall, which regulates water levels. It is usually earthen and often parallel to the course of a river in its floodplain or along low-lying coastlines. - The Patea River is in Taranaki in the North Island of New Zealand. It runs for 105 kilometres from the eastern slopes of Mount Taranaki, passing east through Stratford before swinging south and reaching the South Taranaki Bight near the town of Patea. - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a \\"bayou\\", \\"beck\\", \\"branch\\", \\"brook\\", \\"burn\\", \\"creek\\", \\"crick\\", \\"ghyll\\", \\"gill\\", \\"kill\\", \\"lick\\", \\"mill race\\", \\"race\\", \\"rill\\", \\"river\\", \\"rivulet\\", \\"run\\", \\"runnel\\", \\"streamage\\", \\"syke\\", or \\"wash\\". - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\"). - Mount Taranaki, or Mount Egmont, is an active but quiescent stratovolcano in the Taranaki region on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island. Although the mountain is more commonly referred to as Taranaki, it has two official names under the alternative names policy of the New Zealand Geographic Board. The 2518-metre-high mountain is one of the most symmetrical volcanic cones in the world. There is a secondary cone, Fanthams Peak, , on the south side. Because of its resemblance to Mount Fuji, Taranaki provided the backdrop for the movie \\"The Last Samurai\\". - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - Patea is the third-largest town in South Taranaki, New Zealand. It is on the western bank of the Patea River, 61 kilometres north-west of Whanganui on State Highway 3. Hawera is 27 km to the north-west, and Waverley 17 km to the east. The Patea River flows through the town from the north-east and into the South Taranaki Bight. For the former electorate from 1893 to 1963 see Patea. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it. - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or artificial, that is usually smaller than a lake. They may arise naturally in floodplains as part of a river system, or they may be somewhat isolated depressions (examples include vernal pools and prairie potholes). Usually they contain shallow water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals. A few animals also make their home in ponds, including both alligators and beavers. The type of life in a pond is generally determined by a combination of factors including water level regime (particularly depth and duration of flooding) and nutrient levels, but other factors may also be important, including presence or absence of shading by trees, presence or absence of streams, effects of grazing animals, and salinity. - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - The South Taranaki Bight is a large bay that extends south and east from the south coast of Taranaki in New Zealand's North Island. With more symmetry than poetry or originality, it is matched by the North Taranaki Bight to the north of Cape Egmont. - Etymology is the study of the history of words, their origins, and how their form and meaning have changed over time. By extension, the term \\"the etymology (of a word)\\" means the origin of the particular word. - Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to a slope that it would not naturally keep to (typically a steep, near-vertical or vertical slope).

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - A dam is a barrier that impounds water or underground streams. Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations. Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand.

What is the answer for the question: What month and year were the surviving crew members of the brigantine formerly used as a whaler rescued? from the following article ? The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the...

Johan August Strindberg (; Swedish: [2strInd,baerj] ( listen); 22 January 1849 - 14 May 1912) was a Swedish playwright, novelist, poet, essayist and painter. A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg's career spanned four decades, during which time he wrote over sixty plays and more than thirty works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis, and politics. Influenced by the history of the Paris Commune, during 1871, young Strindberg embraced the view, that politics is a conflict between the upper and lower classes. He was admired by many as a far-left writer. He was a socialist (or perhaps more of an anarchist, meaning a libertarian socialist, which he himself claimed on at least one occasion). Strindberg's political opinions nevertheless changed considerably within this category over the years, and he was never primarily a political writer. Nor did he often campaign for any one issue, preferring instead to scorn his enemies manifesto-style - the military, the church, the monarchy, the politicians, the stingy publishers, the incompetent reviewers, the narrow-minded, the idiots - and he was not loyal to any party or ideology. Many of his works, however, had at least some politics and sometimes an abundance of it. They often displayed that life and the prevailing system were profoundly unjust and injurious to ordinary citizens. The changing nature of his political positions shows in his changing stance on the women's rights issue. Early on, Strindberg was sympathetic to women of 19th-century Sweden, calling for women's suffrage as early as 1884. However, during other periods he had strongly misogynistic opinions, calling for lawmakers to reconsider the emancipation of these \\"half-apes ... mad ... criminal, instinctively evil animals.\\" This is controversial in contemporary assessments of Strindberg, as have his antisemitic descriptions of Jews (and, in particular, Jewish enemies of his in Swedish cultural life) in some works (e.g., Det nya riket), particularly during the early 1880s. Strindberg's antisemitic pronouncements, just like his opinions of women, have been debated, and also seem to have varied considerably. Many of these attitudes, passions and behaviours may have been developed for literary reasons and ended as soon as he had exploited them in books. In satirizing Swedish society - in particular the upper classes, the cultural and political establishment, and his many personal and professional foes - he could be very confrontational, with scarcely concealed caricatures of political opponents. This could take the form of brutal character disparagement or mockery, and while the presentation was generally skilful, it was not necessarily subtle. His daughter Karin Strindberg married a Russian Bolshevik of partially Swedish ancestry, Vladimir Smirnov (\\"Paulsson\\"). Because of his political views, Strindberg was promoted strongly in socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in the Soviet Union and Cuba. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What other causes did he get behind?","completion":"Johan August Strindberg was a Swedish writer who cared about many issues. He wrote about politics, and he believed that life and the system were often unfair to regular people. At different times, he supported women's rights, like letting women vote, but sometimes he didn't like women very much. He also made fun of people in powerful positions, like rich people, politicians, and those who controlled culture. Some of his family members had connections to political groups, too. So, Strindberg got behind causes like women's rights, fairness for regular people, and criticizing the powerful in society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mr Hollande praised the operation as \\"dignified but firm and efficient\\". Some 1,500 unaccompanied minors were staying at a temporary centre, he said. But they would be taken to dedicated reception centres where their cases could be investigated individually by UK officials, he told French newspaper La Voix du Nord.

The camp has for years been a source of friction between the French and UK governments. The UK has taken in some 200 children in recent weeks and is expected to take in hundreds more. \\"Those who don't go will be looked after by child welfare services across France,\\" he said. Last shelter destroyed Volunteering in Calais: The impact of the Jungle What next after the Jungle? Praising the people of Calais for their handling of the migrant crisis over a long time, the president made clear that the camp would not be returning. \\"It's been cleared, it will be made secure and no-one will be able to go back there,\\" Mr Hollande added. France respected the right to asylum, he insisted, but stressed that border controls had stopped 49,000 people crossing into the country since last November. While many of the migrants from Calais have been moved to reception centres across the country, numbers have swelled at makeshift camps in Paris too. Part of a tent camp was cleared on Monday near Stalingrad metro station in the north-east of the capital. Police have raided the camp some 30 times in the past year. The government is facing calls to dismantle the Stalingrad camp completely because some 2,000 migrants have been sleeping rough there. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Andre Johnson caught a 3-yard touchdown pass from David Carr with 3:51 left to cap a 76-yard drive for the Texans, and Wali Lundy's short reception completed the two-point conversion as the Texans finally put points on the board.

They have not won back-to-back road games since 2004, when they beat Chicago (Dec. 19) and Jacksonville (Dec. 26).

We have the equation: 19*s + 111 = 35. To find the value of 's', we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Get rid of the 111 that's added to 19*s. To do that, we will subtract 111 from both sides of the equation: 19*s + 111 - 111 = 35 - 111 After subtracting, we get: 19*s = -76 Now, we only have 19 multiplied by 's' on the left side. Step 2: To find out what 's' is, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 19: (19*s) / 19 = (-76) / 19 The '19's on the left side cancel each other out, leaving just 's': s = -76 / 19 Finally, when we divide -76 by 19, we get: s = -4 So the value of 's' is -4.

The Packers started hot and never looked back, cruising to an easy win over the Eagles, who were tied for the best record in the NFL. The Packers took the ball and went 75 yards, with the big play being Aaron Rodgers hooking up with Jordy Nelson for 65 yards. However, two incomplete passes forced the Packers to settle for a 27-yard Mason Crosby field goal. After an Eagles punt, the Packers stormed 88 yards in 13 plays, taking 6:47 off the clock, ending with Rodgers connecting with DaVante Adams for a 6-yard touchdown pass. Rodgers continued to show that the Eagles' secondary was no match. The Eagles went three-and-out on their next drive, but this time Micah Hyde returned the punt 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the Packers lead to 17-0 in the first quarter. The Eagles finally managed points on their next drive, going 44 yards in 10 plays before Cody Parkey hit a 33-yard field goal with 13:08 remaining in the half. Unfortunately, for the Eagles, there was no stopping Aaron Rodgers. The Packers advanced 80 yards in only 6 plays, with Rodgers throwing for 60 yard on the drive, including the 27-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson. The Eagles offense continued to sputter, punting on their next possession. The Packers continued their utter domination, moving to the Eagles 19 yard-line, but Malcolm Jenkins was flagged for pass interference in the end zone, moving the ball to the 1 yard-line. Eddie Lacy took it in on the very next play(the Packers two-point conversion attempt was unsuccessful) and the Packers led 30-3 with just 2:00 minutes left in the half. On their next drive, the Eagles managed to move 65 yards and Cody Parkey hit his second field goal of the half, trimming the score to 30-6 at halftime. The Eagles drove into Packer territory on their first possession of the second half, but Mark Sanchez lost a fumble that was recovered by Nick Perry. The Packers punted for the first time all night on their next drive, but the Eagles did nothing, punting themselves. The Packers proceeded to march 48 yards and Crosby was successful from 33 yards away, giving the Packers a 33-6 lead. On the following drive Mark Sanchez continued to give up the ball, with defensive end Julius Peppers returning an interception 52 yards for a touchdown making the score 39-6(Crosby's PAT was blocked). Sanchez drove the Eagles 80 yards, hitting Jordan Matthews 10 yards for a touchdown, closing the gap to 39-13. Rodgers responded by hitting Lacy 32 yards for a touchdown on a screen pass. Sanchez threw his second interception of the night on the next possession, but Crosby missed a field goal. Once again Sanchez turned it over (this time on a fumble), and Casey Hayward returned it 49 yards for a touchdown, making the score a humiliating, 53-13. Sanchez hit Jeremy Maclin for a 20-yard touchdown pass on the next Eagle possession, to close the scoring, giving the Packers a 53-20 victory.

While checking the spreadsheet, Michael found what he thought was a mistake by Lawrence, and","completion":"immediately felt somewhat concerned about the potential implications of the error. As he examined the data more closely, he noticed that the figures entered by Lawrence in the revenue column seemed disproportionately high compared to the anticipated profits for the quarter. This disparity raised the suspicion that there may be inaccuracies in the calculations or data entry, which could lead to significant financial miscalculations for the company, and potentially impact their budgeting and forecasting activities moving forward. Before taking any further action, Michael deemed it necessary to verify whether the discrepancy was, in fact, an error, or if it was reasonable and justifiable based on the company's recent performance or any changes in market conditions. To do this, he first cross-referenced their accounting system and financial records to confirm the authenticity of the data Lawrence had based his entries on. He carefully examined the source documents such as invoices, sales receipts, and expense reports to identify any inconsistencies or irregularities that might point to the root of the problem. Upon encountering no major irregularities in the documentation, Michael proceeded to retrace Lawrence's steps in the spreadsheet by going through each formula, cell reference, and function to rule out any mistakes made in the data processing stage. Michael was particularly thorough in reviewing the company's standard procedures for entering data into spreadsheets to ensure that Lawrence had followed the guidelines, and to identify any gaps in their process that could contribute to errors like this occurring in the future. In addition to scrutinizing the spreadsheet's technical aspects, Michael also explored any external factors that might explain the discrepancy. He investigated recent trends in industry news that could potentially lead to a sudden increase in revenue, considered the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and assessed the performance of any new marketing initiatives they had recently launched. It was crucial for Michael to leave no stone unturned in deducing whether Lawrence's entries were indeed a mistake, or represented an unexpected triumph for their team. Once he had collected all the necessary information, Michael decided to approach Lawrence with his findings in a diplomatic and respectful manner, to avoid any confrontation or blame. He acknowledged the possibility that he himself might have misunderstood some part of the process and was open to the fact that Lawrence could provide a reasonable explanation for the high figures. Together, they thoroughly reviewed the spreadsheet, as well as the data sources and underlying assumptions, discussing the context and rationale for the entries, and determining how best to correct any discrepancies and prevent similar inaccuracies in the future. Consequently, this collaboration and vigilance not only helped to safeguard the company's financial integrity but also strengthened the working relationship and trust between Michael and Lawrence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - outdoors - forest - valley - nature - countryside Explain why a human would choose \\"forest\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"forest\\" to answer the question above for several reasons. Firstly, let us analyze each of the options provided and their connections to the original question, which asks about a creek located in a tree: 1. Outdoors: The term \\"outdoors\\" broadly refers to any natural environment or open area outside buildings or enclosed spaces. While a creek in a tree can be classified as part of the outdoors, this option does not specifically indicate the unique aspect of the creek being in a tree. Thus, \\"outdoors\\" is too broad and unspecific a choice. 2. Forest: A forest refers to a large area of land dominated by trees and other woody vegetation, which often contains a diverse array of flora and fauna, comprising its own ecological system. The presence of numerous trees in a forest provides the necessary environment for creeks to form within or among trees. Furthermore, the natural water flow, abundance of leaves and branches to hold water, and the possibility of hollowed-out tree trunks in a forest make it a suitable choice to explain a creek's occurrence within a tree. 3. Valley: A valley is a landform typically characterized by low-lying areas between hills or mountains, usually with a river or stream running through it. Although valleys can contain creeks as part of their hydrological system, they do not specifically imply the presence of trees or the possibility of creeks forming within trees. Therefore, this option does not directly address the question. 4. Nature: Nature refers to the natural world, including all living things, landscapes, and natural processes that occur without human intervention. As with the \\"outdoors\\" option, \\"nature\\" is an encompassing term but does not provide specific details about the creek's existence within a tree or how this might relate to the landscape. 5. Countryside: The countryside is a geographical area made up of rural landscapes and non-urban settlements, typically consisting of agricultural land, forests, and open spaces. Although a countryside may include trees and creeks, it is not explicitly linked to creeks within trees. Choosing this option would not pinpoint the unique situation presented in the question. With this analysis in mind, it becomes clear that \\"forest\\" is the most suitable answer to the question above. Being a habitat characterized by its abundance of trees, a forest provides the perfect environment for the occurrence of a creek within a tree. Humans would choose \\"forest\\" due to the direct connection it has to trees, while the other options either lack this connection or are too general and non-specific. The forest, with its complex ecosystem of trees and water sources, sets an ideal stage for a creek to be in a tree, making it the most logical and accurate choice in answering the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please briefly summarize this news article: ‘Bikeman: A 9/11 Play,’ on a Journalist’s Sept. 11 Experience By KEN JAWOROWSKIFEB. 20, 2014 The portentous narration begins soon after Dan Rather delivers a windy recorded video message to start “Bikeman: A 9/11 Play,” a docudrama by Thomas F. Flynn that recounts his experiences on Sept. 11, 2001. “Nothing in my garden gave a hint of the pain, the hurt and the deep sorrow that would manifest in salty tears on the cheeks of neighborhoods after,” Tom (Robert Cuccioli) says. Why a garden would foretell plane crashes, or later, how Tom would know that a sea gull following him was looking down, “eyes staring and perturbed, mystified, wondering what we have done here,” are just two of the many peculiar questions raised by Mr. Flynn’s script. Granted, “Bikeman” is attempting a lyrical approach to the horrors of that day — the play is adapted from Mr. Flynn’s book, “Bikeman,” “an epic narrative poem” about his ordeal as a journalist who pedaled to ground zero. But as presented here, the work has little reason to be on a stage. There’s no strong plot or dialogue or insight, merely recollections that could inspire poetry yet don’t make a compelling piece of theater. What may succeed on the page frequently clunks when said aloud. The drama that does arise is weak. Besides the talky script’s unvarying tone, too much is told while it is being shown. “He grasps her wrists and forces her to her knees,” Tom says of a policeman restraining a distraught woman, as we see this happening. “I stare in awe at the burning towers,” Tom says, and we watch him do just that. The 45-minute play, Mr. Flynn’s first, was adapted with Michael Bush and directed by Mr. Bush at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center; it might have been better to present it in a smaller space (much like “The Guys,” a Sept. 11 piece that first appeared at the intimate Flea Theater). Playwriting is difficult. Connecting with an audience over such a topic, doubly so. Mr. Cuccioli and a cast of four others handle the script as well as can be expected and are best when Mr. Flynn’s narrative recounts his time in a dark parking garage. Yet even the interesting sections are often marred by cinematic music employed to prod your emotions. That’s another flaw in a story where good words would have been enough. Or perhaps just simple silences. “Bikeman: A 9/11 Play” continues at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers Street, near Greenwich Street; 212-220-1460, bikeman911.com. A version of this review appears in print on February 21, 2014, on page C17 of the New York edition with the headline: Look, but Mostly Listen: Remembering Sept. 11. Order Reprints|Today's Paper|Subscribe Summary:","completion":"\\"Bikeman: A 9/11 Play\\" is a docudrama by Thomas F. Flynn that recounts his experiences on September 11, 2001. The play is adapted from Flynn's book \\"Bikeman,\\" an epic narrative poem about his ordeal as a journalist who pedaled to ground zero. The play lacks a strong plot, dialogue, or insight, merely presenting recollections that could inspire poetry but do not make a compelling piece of theater. The drama is weak, and the script's tone is unvarying. The play fails to connect with the audience over the topic of 9/11, partly due to the cinematic music used to evoke emotions. The performance takes place at the Tribeca Performing Arts Center, but it may have been better suited for a more intimate, smaller space."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's first re-write the provided relationships as follows: 1) a / b = 1 / 3 => a = b / 3 2) b / c = 2 => c = b / 2 3) c / d = 1 / 2 => d = 2c 4) d / e = 3 => e = d / 3 5) e / f = 1 / 2 => f = 2e Now we need to find an expression for abc / def using these relationships. Since a = b / 3, let's substitute it in the expression we want to find. (abc / def) = ((b / 3)c / def) Similarly, c = b / 2: (abc / def) = ((b / 3)(b / 2) / def) Now let's substitute d = 2c: (abc / def) = ((b / 3)(b / 2) / (2c)ef) Since e = d / 3: (abc / def) = ((b / 3)(b / 2) / (2c)f(d / 3)) Next, let's substitute f = 2e: (abc / def) = ((b / 3)(b / 2) / (2c)(d / 3)(2(d / 3))) Now let's simplify the expression: (abc / def) = ((b * b) / (3 * 2 * 2 * c * d * d / (3 * 3))) Cancel out the common terms: (abc / def) = (b * b / (4 * c * d * d)) Now, let's substitute back the values of b and c that we found earlier: (abc / def) = (b * b / (4 * (b / 2) * (2c) * (2c))) (abc / def) = (b * b / (4 * (b / 2) * (2 * (b / 2)) * (2 * (b / 2)))) Simplify further: (abc / def) = (b * b) / (4 * b * b) The b * b terms cancel out: (abc / def) = 1 / 4 So the answer is: Output: e ) 1 / 4"},{"prompt":"Question: \\"What happened in the same year as the funeral?\\" Context: \\"In 1840, Louis Philippe I obtained permission from the British to return Napoleon's remains to France.

He is best known for having crossed the Isthmus of Panama to the Pacific Ocean in 1513, becoming the first European to lead an expedition to have seen or reached the Pacific from the New World. Step 2: Identify key points related to his journey Balboa set sail from Spain in 1500, as part of an expedition led by Rodrigo de Bastidas. During his time in the New World, he helped establish the town of Santa María la Antigua del Darién, the first permanent European settlement on the American mainland. His journey to cross the Isthmus of Panama and reach the Pacific Ocean took place in 1513. Step 3: Determine his original purpose Balboa's original purpose for joining the expedition led by Rodrigo de Bastidas in 1500 wasn't to find the Pacific Ocean but to explore the Caribbean coasts of the South and Central Americas. His goal, like many other explorers of that time, was to find wealth (such as gold, silver, and other treasures) and expand Spain's territories in the New World.

Article: In his Harvard \\"Lectures on Pragmatism\\" (1903), Peirce enumerated what he called the \\"three cotary propositions of pragmatism\\" (L: cos, cotis whetstone), saying that they \\"put the edge on the maxim of pragmatism\\". First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street. That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses. Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of abductive inference, its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique – in a word, incorrigible. This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or \\"thisness\\" – what the Scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction. Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them. This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research, most recently for instance with the work of Irvin Rock on indirect perception.

Remember to change the sign, so -6 becomes +6: -2*q = 6. Finally, we want to find \\"q\\" by itself, so we will divide by -2 on both sides: q = 6 / -2. q = -3. And there you go!

Pick your answer from: 1). World 2). Sports 3). Business 4). Science/Tech Answer:","completion":"This text is about an earthquake that occurred in western Japan, which falls under the category of world events and natural disasters. The Richter Scale indicates the magnitude of the earthquake, and it is crucial to understand the impact and severity of the event. The earthquake occurred shortly after another strong quake in the same region, highlighting the dangers and challenges faced by those living in seismically active areas. Natural disasters like earthquakes can have significant impacts on the lives of people, infrastructure, and the environment. The Richter Scale, developed by Charles F. Richter in 1935, is used to quantify the strength of earthquakes. The scale measures the amplitude of seismic waves, which helps determine the energy released during an earthquake. The fact that this earthquake had a magnitude of 7.3 indicates that it was a major event, capable of causing significant damage. In this particular instance, the text mentions that two strong earthquakes occurred in western Japan within a short timeframe. This raises concerns about the potential for aftershocks and further damages to the affected area. Japan is situated along the Pacific Ring of Fire, making it highly prone to earthquakes due to the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates. Earthquakes can lead to a variety of consequences, such as the destruction of buildings, roads, and other critical infrastructure. They can also trigger secondary disasters, such as tsunamis and landslides, which can exacerbate the damage and loss of life. In addition, earthquakes may disrupt essential services, including communication, transportation, and power supply, further complicating rescue and recovery efforts. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding and monitoring seismic activity, as well as preparing for and mitigating the effects of earthquakes. This involves retrofitting buildings to make them more resilient, establishing early warning systems, and conducting regular drills to educate and train communities on proper response during and after such disasters. To sum up, the text is about a 7.3 magnitude earthquake that occurred in western Japan, which is categorized under world events and natural disasters. The information provided highlights the need for greater awareness and preparedness to minimize the potential damages and impacts of such events on human life, infrastructure, and the environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Mr Trump's cabinet includes conservatives who oppose gay rights, and Gaga said she would work to protect advances made by the LGBTQ community. \\"[We] are going to do everything that we can to protect the social progress we have made over the last eight years,\\" she told BBC News. \\"Political progress cannot happen unless there is social progress. \\"You can create lots of jobs, you can create new policy - but those things cannot work unless people like each other, unless people are kind to one another. \\"We need to stay in a kind place and we need to bond during this time, and be as harmonious as possible, and intelligent in the way we approach this.\\" Although Mr Trump has called himself a \\"real friend\\" of the LGBTQ community, several of his appointments have caused alarm within it. Early in his career, vice President-elect Mike Pence opposed same-sex marriage and appeared to advocate diverting government funds away from HIV treatment in favour of gay \\"conversion therapy\\". His spokesman recently denied this, telling the New York Times that Pence neither \\"supported or advocated\\" the practice. More recently, he signed into law a controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Critics argue the law discriminates against the LGBT community by allowing businesses to refuse service over religious beliefs. Under national pressure, he later signed an amendment stating businesses could not discriminate against gay people, drawing criticism from conservatives who said they felt betrayed by the revision. There have also been concerns over the appointment of Jeff Sessions as attorney general. The Alabama senator opposed lifting a ban on openly gay people serving in the military and voted in support of banning same-sex marriage. Lady Gaga has long been an advocate for the LGBTQ community, and spent part of last week's Thanksgiving holiday visiting a shelter for homeless LGBTQ youth in New York. The star, who campaigned stridently for Hillary Clinton during the election, also protested outside Trump Tower when the results were announced last month. But she accepted that not everyone would see her as a suitable spokesperson on US politics. \\"I've done a lot in my career,\\" she said. \\"I'm sure there's many people who would say 'Lady Gaga's not role model.

She performed from inside a giant \\"snow globe\\" on the roof of the Westfield Shopping Centre, playing acoustic versions of her songs Bad Romance, Joanne and Million Reasons. \\"It's a very holiday-like, warm experience,\\" she told the BBC. \\"I love my London and UK fans so much, and performing my new music for them in such an intimate and spectacular location was the perfect way to celebrate the holidays.\\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Obama says U.S. ideals and security at stake in Syria Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama tried Tuesday to sell a military intervention he never wanted to an American public that opposes it, telling the nation that he needed authorization to attack Syria as leverage in a newly emerged diplomatic opening from Russia. Calling the United States \\"the anchor of global security,\\" Obama offered moral, political and strategic arguments for being ready to launch limited military strikes while trying to negotiate a diplomatic solution to what he called Syria's violation of a global ban on chemical weapons. \\"Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake in Syria, along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the worst weapons will never be used,\\" Obama said in making the case that the United States must act when dictators such as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \\"brazenly\\" violate international treaties intended to protect humanity. The 15-minute nationally televised speech initially was planned as Obama's final push to win support from a skeptical public and Congress for his planned attack on Syria for what his administration calls a major chemical weapons attack on August 21 that killed more than 1,400 people in suburban Damascus. 5 key themes from the Obama speech New offer impacts Obama's challenge However, Monday's unexpected diplomatic overture by Russia changed the strategic and political equation. Under the Russian plan, which still lacks any details, Syria would turn over its chemical weapons stockpiles to international control. That would meet Obama's main criterion of ending the chemical weapons threat by the al-Assad regime. However, Russia canceled a U.N. Security Council meeting it had called for Tuesday and rejected an initial proposal by France for the framework of a resolution, raising questions about whether the diplomatic effort was serious or a stall tactic to put off a U.S. attack on Syria. For Obama, the Russian proposal prompted by a seemingly off-the-cuff comment by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry further muddied an already complex challenge in Syria compounded by public concerns of another possible military quagmire. The president called the Russian offer an encouraging sign, but warned that \\"it's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments.\\" Therefore, he said, he asked Congress to postpone a vote for now on authorizing military force against Syria. In addition, the diplomatic push will provide more time for United Nations inspectors to report their findings on the August attack and allow his administration to continue rallying support for an international response, the president said. Military to remain current posture At the same time, Obama said he ordered the U.S. military to maintain its \\"current posture to keep the pressure on Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.\\" Kerry made the same argument at a congressional hearing Tuesday, telling legislators that \\"nothing focuses the mind like the prospect of a hanging.\\" However, congressional support for military action reflected public opposition. A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday said 59% of respondents opposed congressional authorization of military action, while 72% said American strikes would achieve no significant goals. In an instant poll of people who watched the speech Tuesday night, 61% favored Obama's approach compared to 37% who opposed it. The CNN/ORC International survey showed almost two-thirds of respondents thought the Syria situation would be resolved through diplomatic efforts, while 47% said Obama made a convincing case for military action compared to 50% who said he didn't. By CNN's best estimate, the sample of poll respondents -- 37% Democrats, 20% Republicans and 43% independents -- was about seven percentage points more Democratic than the general public. Critics call the situation faced by Obama his own doing for a confused Syria policy that he has never fully explained. \\"There's a degree of incoherence that I have never seen the likes of,\\" veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona told CNN on Tuesday. In the most emotional part of the speech, Obama cited the videos his administration made public that showed victims of the Syrian sarin gas attack. \\"The images from this massacre are sickening: men, women, children lying in rows, killed by poison gas, others foaming at the mouth, gasping for breath, a father clutching his dead children, imploring them to get up and walk,\\" the president said in emphasizing the horror of chemical weapons. \\"The question now is what the United States of America and the international community is prepared to do about it, because what happened to those people -- to those children -- is not only a violation of international law, it's also a danger to our security,\\" Obama added. Directly addressing questions he received from members of Congress and letters from the public, the president insisted that any U.S. military strike would be limited in scope and mission. What's next on Obama's to-do list No American boots on the ground \\"I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of any military action -- no matter how limited -- is not going to be popular,\\" he said, later declaring: \\"I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria. I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan. I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo. This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective, deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad's capabilities.\\" At the same time, he rejected criticism that such a limited military response would prove meaningless, saying \\"the United States military doesn't do pin pricks.\\" \\"Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver,\\" Obama said. \\"I don't think we should remove another dictator with force. We learned from Iraq that doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next. But a targeted strike can makes Assad -- or any other dictator -- think twice before using chemical weapons.\\" He described the U.S. role in the world as \\"doing more than forging international agreements; it has meant enforcing them.\\" \\"The burdens of leadership are often heavy, but the world's a better place because we have borne them,\\" Obama said before making a direct appeal to both sides of the political spectrum. \\"To my friends on the right, I ask you to reconcile your commitment to America's military might with the failure to act when a cause is so plainly just,\\" he said. \\"To my friends on the left, I ask you to reconcile your belief in freedom and dignity for all people with those images of children writhing in pain and going still on a cold hospital floor, for sometimes resolutions and statements of condemnation are simply not enough.\\" He concluded by challenging \\"every member of Congress and those of you watching at home tonight to view those videos of the attack, and then ask what kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas and we choose to look the other way?\\" McCain and fellow GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina responded by saying Obama failed to speak forcefully enough \\"about the need to increase our military assistance to moderate opposition forces in Syria, such as the Free Syrian Army.\\" They called for the United States and its allies on the U.N. Security Council to \\"immediately\\" offer a resolution \\"that lays out what steps Syria would have to take to give up its chemical weapons, including making a full and accurate declaration of all of its chemical weapons and granting international monitors unfettered access to all sites in Syria that possess these weapons.\\" \\"This resolution would have to threaten serious consequences if the Assad regime does not comply,\\" they said, calling for an up-or-down vote by the Security Council, where Syrian allies Russia and China have so far blocked any U.N. action against Syria. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat and staunch Obama supporter who is undecided on Syria, praised him for \\"a very good job\\" but said his position on the issue remained unchanged. \\"It was not a wasted speech,\\" said Cummings, noting his constituents are tired of war. \\"I thought he made a great moral argument.\\" Opinion: Obama's speech won't sell Americans on Syria For two years, Obama resisted calls by conservative hawks such McCain to back rebels fighting the al-Assad regime, saying the United States sought no role in the Syrian civil war. When evidence of chemical weapons use emerged earlier this year, and Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon helped al-Assad's forces gain the upper hand, Obama agreed in June to provide military aid to the rebels. The August attack clearly crossed a \\"red line\\" he declared earlier against chemical weapons use, prompting his decision for what he hoped would be an international military response against Syria. However, Britain's Parliament voted against joining a military response, denying Obama a normally reliable ally. He then decided to seek authorization from Congress to provide political cover and buy time to build a broader international coalition. Now legislators from both parties are threatening to oppose a resolution authorizing a military response, and Obama has asked for time to let the diplomatic process play out. Kerry heads to Geneva on Thursday for talks with his Russian counterpart, who first offered his government's proposal Monday after Kerry earlier said Syria's turning over its chemical weapons was the only way to avoid a U.S. attack. Syria agreed Tuesday to the Russian proposal, with Foreign Minister Walid Moallem saying his government was ready to disclose the location of its chemical weapons, halt production, and show its facilities to representatives of Russia, the United Nations, and other unspecified states. At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that \\"all of this will only mean anything if the United States and other nations supporting it tell us that they're giving up their plan to use force against Syria.\\" \\"You can't really ask Syria, or any other country, to disarm unilaterally while military action against it is being contemplated,\\" Putin said in an interview with a Russian television network. Opinion: Obama's speech a model of persuasion Obama: Threat of strikes still critical For his part, Obama sought to persuade Americans of the opposite -- that the diplomatic stirrings by Russia and Syria occurred because of the credible threat of a military attack intended to deter Syria from using its chemical weapons again. The president has not said whether he would launch strikes without the support of Congress. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of eight senators is working on an alternative resolution to the one authorizing military action already passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It would include \\"guidelines, reporting process and benchmarks that have to be met,\\" McCain told CNN. On the House side, Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said he was working on a version of a resolution that would authorize a military response if the diplomatic process failed to yield an acceptable result in 30 days. The Obama administration has launched a sweeping lobbying effort, with the president meeting on Capitol Hill on Tuesday with senators from both parties as part of a series of classified briefings, hearings and other consultations on the Syria issue. Since Friday, the administration has spoken with at least 93 senators and more than 350 members of the House, a White House official said Tuesday. Despite such outreach, indications were that the congressional push wasn't working. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the top-ranking Republican in the Senate, announced Tuesday he will vote against authorizing military action on Syria. So did Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who won the seat vacated by Kerry when he became secretary of state. A running CNN vote count showed most members of Congress remained undecided, with significant opposition in both chambers among the much smaller numbers who have announced their decision leaving the outcome in doubt. Opinion: Speech aims to keep heat on Syria CNN's Jim Acosta, Josh Levs, John King, Ted Barrett, Kevin Bohn, Stephanie Halasz and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report. Summary:","completion":"In 2013, President Barack Obama tried to persuade the American public to support a military intervention in Syria as leverage in a new diplomatic opening from Russia. Obama called the United States \\"the anchor of global security\\" and argued strongly for launching limited military strikes while trying to negotiate a diplomatic solution to Syria's violation of the global ban on chemical weapons. Diplomatic efforts by Russia, Syria's main ally, changed the strategic equation, causing Obama to ask Congress to postpone a vote on authorizing military force against Syria. The situation in Syria remains complex; as the Syrian civil war escalated, and evidence of chemical weapon use emerged, Obama called for international military responses against Syria, with Congress still debating over resolutions before the latest developments in diplomatic efforts."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Vandal sabotages Verizon fiber-optic cables in Bronx A rash of vandalism across Verizon cable and phone lines that has swept through nine states during a three-week strike involving 36,000 workers hit the Bronx. About two hundred customers briefly lost phone, data and internet service Tuesday at around 2 a.m. when someone cut cables attached to a fiber optic hub on E. 196th St. and Hobart Ave. in Pelham Bay. An underground cable was also severed there, officials said. Verizon spokesman Richard Young attributed the vandalism to the strikers. EDITORIAL: STRIKE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS “It was a deliberate act of sabotage in which 200 customers were deprived of their ability to call friends or family or 911,” he said. “We have no idea who's doing this, but it impacts customers to a point where they could switch to our competitors, and that could affect our employment numbers down the line. In short, this is reckless, dangerous, short-sighted and dumb,” he said. In all, there have been 84 cases of similar vandalism in the region which stretches from New York to Virginia in the three weeks of the strike, Verizon said. That’s a huge spike, according to Young. He said the company gets reports of intentionally severed cables only about five times a year, and they rarely happen in heavily populated areas. Of the 84 incidents, 19 were in the city, 17 were in New Jersey, 12 were in Pennsylvania and two were in Massachusetts. The locations of the remaining 34 incidents were not immediately available. About 10,000 customers in all were temporarily affected by the outages. “There's no reason to do this other than try to hurt the company and our customers,” Young said. A spokeswoman for the Communication Workers of America denied any worker involvement. \\"There’s no reason why a Verizon worker would do that,” the spokesperson said. She blamed replacement workers for failures in the Verizon network. “Replacement workers just aren't following basic safety protocols,” she said. “And it's not their fault. They're minimally trained.” Some 36,000 Verizon workers walked off the job three weeks ago in an ongoing contract dispute over wages, pensions and health care benefits. Young insisted that the company wants to resolve the negotiations and get people back to work. “We put a proposal on the table last week,” he said. “The union came back to us but moved the ball in the wrong direction.” The striking workers plan more than 400 protests across the nation Thursday. About 2,000 workers will march Thursday from the Verizon office building on West St. near Battery Park to a Verizon Wireless story on Wall Street to demand a “fair” contract.","completion":"A series of vandal attacks on Verizon cable and phone lines has affected nine US states and comes amid a three-week strike involving 36,000 workers.

Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing. Now answer this question: What material comprised the game cartridge connectors?","completion":"The game cartridge connectors were comprised of copper. These copper connectors were prone to tarnishing, leading to issues with the functioning of the games. Many players tried to alleviate these issues by blowing into the cartridges and then reinserting them, but this actually accelerated the tarnishing process and further damaged the copper connectors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Building a new cowshed is an essential task for farmers to provide comfortable, hygienic, and safe living conditions for their cattle. To construct an efficient and modern cowshed, you will need to consider several main factors such as location, size, design, ventilation, drainage, and material. 1. Location: Choose an area with a gentle slope to ensure natural drainage, and avoid low-lying, flood-prone zones. The cowshed should also have easy access to water and electricity supplies and be close to the feeding area. 2. Size: The cowshed's size will depend on the number of cows you plan to house. On average, each cow should have around 40-60 square feet of space. Consider a long, rectangular shape that's easy to segment into feeding, resting, and milking areas. 3. Design: The cowshed's design will largely depend on the climate and your budget. Here are some design options: - Loose housing: In this system, cows are housed in a large, open space, allowing them to move and interact freely. This type of design is beneficial for cow welfare but requires more floor space and regular cleaning. - Tie stalls: This traditional design consists of individual stalls where cows are tied. While these are easier to keep clean and require less floor space, they may not be as comfortable for the cows. - Freestall barns: This design combines the benefits of both loose housing and tie stalls. The cows are free to move between individual stalls, while still allowing farmers to control the space. 4. Ventilation: Provide adequate ventilation to ensure a fresh supply of air and maintain a comfortable temperature. This can be achieved by using ridge vents, open eave systems, or fans. Proper ventilation not only removes stale air and odors but also reduces heat stress, improves cow comfort, and helps control diseases related to poor air quality. 5. Drainage: To create a healthy and clean environment, effectively plan the cowshed’s drainage. Liquid waste should be quickly removed from the building to prevent buildup and maintain cleanliness. Slatted floors and sloping floors are common solutions in new cowshed designs. 6. Material: Opt for durable, low-maintenance materials that can withstand the regular wear-and-tear caused by the cows. High-quality concrete floors are an excellent option, as they're easy to clean and are slip-resistant. For the walls, consider masonry, which is long-lasting and provides insulation. 7. Facilities: Ensure that you include facilities such as milking parlors, feeding areas, water troughs, and separate areas for calving or sick cows in the cowshed. Proper lighting should also be considered for better visibility and worker efficiency. 8. Environmental regulations and permits: Make sure to comply with all local and national regulations, including acquiring necessary permits before starting the construction process. In summary, constructing a new cowshed involves careful planning and consideration of various aspects, including location, design, size, materials, and environmental regulations. By creating a comfortable and safe environment for your cattle, you can ensure their well-being and, in turn, improve overall productivity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Internet taunts: Rebecca Adlington, 23, re-Tweeted an abusive message sent to her - horus after winning another event in Barcelona. Olympic champion swimmer Rebecca Adlington has outed a Twitter troll who sent her an abusive message online - days after complaining about being subjected to vile taunts. The 23-year-old was called a 'whale' with a 'shark fin nose' in the abusive Tweet, she revealed yesterday hours after scooping gold in the 800m freestyle in Barcelona. The message was apparently sent by Callum Aspley, a 19-year-old Leeds Metropolitan University undergraduate who is himself a keen sportsman. However, he has denied sending it at 11pm on a Saturday night – and blamed it on one of his friends. Miss Adlington re-Tweeted the message for her 51,000 followers to see and said it was a ‘perfect example’ of the abuse she has had to endure. The swimmer, who won the 400m and 800m freestyle events at the Beijing Olympics, has vowed to ignore the internet altogether during this summer’s games. The abusive message said: ‘you shark fin nosed ******** , you belong in that pool you ****ing whale.’ Yesterday she received a stream of supportive Tweets from her followers. One fan wrote: ‘Becky, that's just a lowlife - ignore him because you know how talented you are x’ Miss Adlington, a 400m and 800m freestyle champion, revealed last week she has received a number of vile messages from 'idiots'. She said: ‘I used to read all the stuff about me. I learned very quickly not to do that. ‘It is awful. Even if there are ten nice comments you get one idiot. I’ve now given up. It upsets me or gets me angry. ‘They are to do with how I look, which has nothing to do with my performance in the pool. It’s just nasty comments about things I can’t control. I can’t help the way I look.’ She said: ‘I don’t know how people expect to send a nasty message and not get blocked. I won’t be checking Twitter or going on it a lot during the Games. Abuse: The vile message sent from @CallumAspley re-Tweeted by Rebecca Adlington as the 'perfect example' of the offensive remarks she has received. Rebecca Adlington has said she will avoid the internet completely during the Olympics. ‘The messages of support are amazing but you do have the chance of someone saying something that is going to be annoying. You don’t want that added stress. You don’t want to be thinking about that. I think I will just tweet once it is over.’ It is not the first time Miss Adlington, of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, has been publicly abused over her looks. In 2009, BBC panel show Mock The Week was censured after broadcasting ‘nasty’ comments about her by comedian Frankie Boyle. Reflecting on the BBC incident, the swimmer said: ‘It’s hard for a woman. A guy doesn’t get comments on his weight or his looks. But for women it is difficult because we get criticised for our weight or how we look.’ The double Olympic champion won gold again on Saturday in the 800m Freestyle in Barcelona in the Mare Nostrum series. She put in an assured performance and recorded a championship record time of 8 minutes 19.86 seconds. Adlington led from the front and built up a lead of over two seconds at the halfway stage, finishing strongly ahead of Spain's Mireia Garcia Belmonte, the world short-course silver medallist. Today the student behind the Twitter account that the abusive message was sent from had not yet responded to a request for comment from the MailOnline. He has however taken his Twitter page down. He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I didn't send the tweet myself, I was out with my mates and one of them got hold of my phone and so he must have sent it, it wasn't me. ‘I don't use Twitter a lot and I don't know how to delete a tweet. ‘Obviously I don't agree with what was said, I wouldn't say that kind of thing.’ He added that he does not usually use Twitter and would delete the message. The undergraduate, who plays for his university rugby team, previously played rugby and cricket for his secondary school in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He has refused to name who was actually behind the abusive message.

The wall was set up just outside of the castle gate to defend it from attack, as the","completion":"kingdom had seen an increase in threats from rival factions in recent years, causing a sense of unrest and anxiety within the royal court and the general populace. The construction of this sturdy barrier, made from reinforced stone and accented with strategically placed battlements, had been undertaken with great urgency, both to serve as a practical safeguard against potential invasions and as a symbolic display of the resilience and determination of the reigning monarch and their loyal subjects. The decision to build the wall had not been made lightly, as the ruler of the kingdom had consulted with their council of advisors who had weighed the potential benefits and drawbacks of such an action. As rumors of an impending army amassing beyond the kingdom's borders began to circulate, the thorny issue of whether to divert valuable resources and manpower to the wall's construction became an increasingly pressing concern. Ultimately, the council's consensus supported the endeavor, acknowledging that the potential risks of an unprotected, easily accessed castle gate could outweigh the costs of its fortification. Once the construction project was approved, a throng of skilled masons, laborers, and engineers were hastily assembled, working tirelessly day and night under the watchful eye of the royal architect to ensure that the wall was meticulously crafted according to the latest siege defense techniques. Wooden scaffolding surrounded the towering structure, while the clanging of hammers and chisels against stone echoed throughout the once-peaceful courtyard, drowning out the songbirds that once filled the air with their melodies. As the wall began to take shape, those living within the castle's walls – nobles and commoners alike – looked upon its progress with a mixture of awe and trepidation. Certainly, the imposing structure would serve as a powerful deterrent to any would-be attackers, but the very necessity of its existence was a chilling reminder of the precarious nature of the kingdom's political climate. For the time being, however, the burgeoning sense of anxiety was tempered with an almost palpable air of hope and pride among the castle's inhabitants, each of whom contributed to the project in their own way, whether by offering a word of encouragement to the weary workers or donating a portion of their weekly wages to help fund the wall's completion. As the final stones were fitted securely into place and the wooden barriers that had protected the work area were dismantled, revealing the imposing, solid edifice in its entirety for the first time, the castle's occupants gathered ‘round to examine their collective handiwork. The wall, boasting an impressive height and thickness and adorned with sharp, menacing crenellations, would indeed prove to be an insurmountable obstacle to any hostile entity that dared approach the castle gate. And so, as dusk fell and the setting sun cast long, dramatic shadows across the courtyard, the wall stood as a silent, unyielding sentinel – a testament to the unwavering resolve of an entire kingdom standing united in the face of adversity. The newly fortified castle gate now symbolized more than just a physical barrier; it bore the weight of an entire nation's hope, determination, and resilience in the face of a tumultuous and uncertain future."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

These values are required for the problem. Part #2: Starting from the kth element of A. Usage: Start at '5429' Explanation: Here, k = 2, which means we'll start from the 2nd element in the list A which is '5429'. Part #3: Find every ith element. Usage: Iterate over the list A with a step size of i Explanation: In this case, i = 1, so we need to continue selecting every element after the previous element in the list A. Part #4: The process stops when the position of the next ith element exceeds the length of the list. Usage: Stop the process when we reach the end of the list A or the next ith element is beyond the list. Explanation: In this example, since i=1, the process stops when we reach the end of the list A.

The hypothesis is true: The girl could indeed have gotten a new toy, and she is playing with her newly acquired stuffed animal. The redheaded child might be interested in the new toy as well or could merely be watching her friend enjoy her new possession. 2. The hypothesis is false: It is also possible that the stuffed animal is not new; the girl may have had it for a long time, or it might even be a borrowed toy. The redheaded child might be watching her interact with the toy for different reasons, such as curiosity, entertainment, or simple companionship. 3.

Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

There is not enough information to connect the two scenarios provided in these sentences. Firstly, the scenarios in both statements involve different activities by the hiker. In the first statement, the hiker is waving to the camera, which implies that he is likely to be the subject of the photoshoot or video. On the other hand, the second statement portrays a hiker taking pictures of buildings, which implies that he is the one capturing the images, rather than being the subject. Secondly, the settings presented in each sentence are contrasting as well. The first statement describes a scene where a hiker is standing in front of snowcapped mountains, indicating a landscape image or video. This suggests that the hiker is in a high-altitude, mountainous area surrounded by snow-covered peaks. In contrast, the second statement places the hiker in an environment with buildings, which implies a more urban or developed area. It is unlikely that a hiker would be taking pictures of buildings while standing in front of snowcapped mountains. Lastly, the two sentences do not have any logical connection that would suggest a cause-and-effect or sequential relationship between them. Neither the act of waving to the camera nor the act of taking pictures of buildings implies or supports the other in any way.

The judge in the Oscar Pistorius trial has been placed under police protection after her decision to acquit the athlete murder sparked anger around the world. Several legal groups in South Africa have expressed concern about threats and harsh criticism of Judge Thokozile Masipa which they say could amount to racism and contempt of court. Judge Masipa, one of the first black female judges in South Africa, last week found Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide, but not guilty of the more serious charge of murder. Scroll down for video. South African Judge Thokozile Masipa (pictured delivering her verdicts) has been placed under police protection after receiving threats over her decision to acquit Oscar Pistorius of murder. Some South Africans said they were surprised and even shocked when she ruled last week that the Paralympic champion was negligent but did not intend to kill when he fatally shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a closed toilet door. Pistorius said he thought a dangerous intruder was in his house. Prosecutors alleged he intentionally killed Steenkamp after an argument. Police protection for Masipa has been stepped up since the verdict on Friday in the sensational case, South African media reported. The case will return to the global spotlight when Pistorius, who is free on bail, appears before the judge for a sentencing hearing on October 13. In a statement, three legal groups described a 'wave of criticism' directed at Masipa that in some cases could border on hate speech, defamation and contempt of court. Pistorius leaves the court in Pretoria after being cleared of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp, but found guilty of culpable homicide and has been granted bail until being sentenced next month. The comments include allegations that the judge is corrupt, as well as attacks on her race and gender. 'In judging, there's a lot of analysis of the information before the court and applying the law to what is before you,' Thabang Pooe, a researcher at legal group SECTION27, said today. 'Attacking the judge's integrity and making insinuations of bribery or that she's not fit because she's a woman, or that she's black, means that you're breaking down the belief in the law.' Masipa, 66, is a former social worker and journalist who became one of the first black female judges in South Africa, which shed white racist rule in 1994. Her supporters have described her as a symbol of accomplishment in a country where poverty and unemployment remain obstacles for many people. The legal groups, including SECTION27, the Legal Resources Centre and the Centre for Child Law, said people are entitled to disagree with the verdict and that the prosecution can appeal. South African media react to the decision not to convict the Paralympian of murder. Prosecutors have said they will decide whether to appeal after sentencing. The sentence for a culpable homicide conviction is at the judge's discretion and can range from a suspended sentence and a fine to as much as 15 years in prison. Legal experts have cited five years as a guideline. Many legal analysts agreed with the judge's ruling that Pistorius could not be found guilty of premeditated murder. But some believe the law supported a conviction on a lesser murder charge on the grounds that Pistorius knew someone - in his version, a perceived intruder - was behind the toilet door and also knew that firing four bullets into the door could cause that person's death. James Grant, an associate professor of law at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said in an online analysis that 'there appear to be errors of law' in Masipa's judgment. 'The effect is that, if the state does appeal, and one may well expect that it will, Pistorius continues to face the prospect of a murder conviction,' Grant wrote. Meanwhile, South African sports officials. have said Pistorius can compete for South Africa again, as long as his. running doesn't go against the ruling of the judge. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"In the Oscar Pistorius trial, the judge, Thokozile Masipa, made a decision that led to people being angry. This decision was about Oscar not being guilty of a serious charge. Because of this, the judge now needs police protection to keep her safe from threats and mean things people are saying about her. This case is important and people all around the world are watching. In October, they will have another meeting to decide what should happen to Oscar now. Some people still think he might be guilty of something else."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Ajer, a project player for now, brings the number of midfielders at Celtic Park to 17 with another five currently on loan at lower-league clubs. On the face of it, 17 - or 22 depending on how you look at it - is an eye-watering number, but, of course, the overall figure is a bit misleading. Among that cavalry are young players on loan and who may never get a look-in, plus the deadwood that is Derk Boerrigter, a passenger who has cost Celtic, between transfer fee and wages, somewhere north of £4.5m since his arrival from Ajax in 2013. Strip out those who haven't got any kind of realistic shot at the first team next season and you are still left with more than a dozen and possibly as many 14 or 15 midfield players at Celtic Park. The club is on a hoarding mission. In one area of the pitch they're bursting at the seams. In another area - up front - they are almost threadbare. Consider opening day next season and the possible Celtic line-up from their usual two holding players to the three ahead of them and then Leigh Griffiths up top. Scott Brown and Nir Bitton would probably be the two buffers. Stuart Armstrong, Stefan Johansen and Gary Mackay-Steven could be the three. Or maybe Charlie Mulgrew and Ajer - if he develops quickly - could be the holding players with James Forrest, Kris Commons and Roberts ahead of them. Then again, Callum McGregor and Liam Henderson - presuming he returns from Hibs - could hold the fort in the defensive midfield roles with Tom Rogic, Scott Allan and Ryan Christie playing in the advanced positions. Choices, choices. Too many. There isn't a chance in hell that manager Ronny Deila can keep everybody, never mind keep everybody sweet. Ajer is a development player so he can't be expecting much game-time - he might end up as a centre-half in any event - but most of the rest of them will be looking for plenty of action and most of them are going to be disappointed. Roberts is an interesting customer. Clearly he's an extremely talented kid and, after Manchester City paid £12m for him, his reputation is skyscraper-high. He's not Celtic's player, but the next 18 months could see him thrill fans and make them suspend reality and pretend that he's one of their own. If you can forget for a moment that he's only there on loan, Roberts' signing could be something special. Manchester City would not have given him to Celtic for that length of time if the deal didn't come with a commitment to play him regularly. That was Celtic's bargaining chip - first-team football. Who would you have alongside him? Commons, Johansen, Rogic, McGregor, Allan? And who would play outside him? Armstrong, Mackay-Steven, Forrest, Christie, Henderson? Celtic have more midfielders in their squad than Imelda Marcos had shoes in her wardrobe. Some will be bit-part players, some will have no part to play at all and will be quietly moved on. There needs to be a cull. Deila has arrived at a bizarre situation where he has way too many midfielders - and too many similar-type midfielders - and not nearly enough strikers - and only one effective striker. The imbalance is the thing. In defence, Celtic are attempting to make things right. They have a first-choice of Mikael Lustig, Jozo Simunovic, Erik Sviatchenko and Kieran Tierney. Lustig is the only one of that lot who's over 24. That's a promising combination once it has a chance to bed-in. The back-up doesn't inspire confidence, but at least it exists in bits and pieces. Up front, Griffiths is not just The Man, he's pretty much The Only Man. You'd call Colin Kazim-Richards a deeply odd acquisition but then what level of puzzlement would you reserve for Carlton Cole? These two have a combined age of 61, zero sell-on value and a questionable - at best - goal threat. Celtic's most expensive strikers are on loan. Nadir Ciftci is in Turkey, Stefan Scepovic is in Spain and Anthony Stokes is in Edinburgh but may as well be in Timbuktu as far as Deila is concerned. Deila is packing his squad with midfielders and giving himself a world of choice, but in the business of strikers Celtic continue to leave themselves curiously short. At some point in the summer they'll need to think about the doomsday question and come up with a compelling answer: What happens if Griffiths gets injured or loses form? How do you like the sound of 4-6-0?","completion":"Celtic Park has an abundance of midfielders, with many of them expecting game-time, while their striker options are limited, leading to an imbalance in the team that needs to be addressed."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Coming off their divisional win over the Browns, the Steelers stayed at home for a Week 7 interconference duel with the 6-0 Minnesota Vikings. Pittsburgh got the game's opening score late in the first quarter with kicker Jeff Reed nailing a 39-yard field goal. The Vikings would answer in the second quarter with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Adrian Peterson, yet the Steelers struck back with Ben Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Mike Wallace. Both teams would swap field goals in the third quarter, with Reed booting a 27-yard field goal and Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell making an 18-yard field goal.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"Hello there, little buddy! To make a shaded wood putty by mixing something with wood glue, there are a few ways you can do it. Let's look at two methods and see which one is more reasonable. Method 1: Mix wood glue with sawdust You can mix wood glue with some sawdust (tiny wood pieces) that matches the color of your wood project. This will create a wood putty that has a similar shade as your wood. Just mix the wood glue and sawdust together until you have a thick, paste-like consistency. Method 2: Mix wood glue with a wood dye or stain Another way to make a shaded wood putty is to mix wood glue with a wood dye or stain that matches the color of your wood project. This will give you a putty with the right color, but it may not have the same texture as the wood. Between these two methods, Method 1 with sawdust is more reasonable for making a shaded wood putty. The sawdust-grainy texture will better match the wood's appearance and be easier to work with when filling in gaps or holes in your project.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The federal government is about to make a huge investment in high school. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Congress has put aside more than 100 billion, including a competitive \\"Race to the Top\\" fund that encourages innovation in public schools. But the real revolution, hidden in the Race to the Top guidelines released by the Department of Education last month, is that high school has a new mission. No longer is it enough just for senior graduate students, or even prepare them for college. Schools must now show how they increase both college enrollment and the number of students who complete at least a year of college. In other words, high schools must now focus on grade 13. Some states, school districts and nonprofit educational organizations have begun to gather data about how freshmen get along in college after graduation, but they haven't made fast progress. Florida has one of the best systems, but even it can't explain a high school graduate who enrolls in college in another state. The nation is asking principals to deliver students who can succeed in college, without ensuring they know whether what they're doing is working. The Department of Education has begun to solve this problem by instructing states on how to keep good records of its graduates' progress in college. This gives high schools the two pieces of information they most need: their college enrollment rate and \\"college proficiency\\" rate (the speed with which graduates complete a year of college-level coursework). Race to the Top has finally established a realistic purpose for high school in the 21st century. If principals can now get the support they need to fulfill that purpose, high schools can once again be top producers of American potential . The answer is:","completion":"Which of the following best describes the new mission for American high schools introduced by the Race to the Top guidelines? A. Focus solely on high school graduation rates B. Only prepare students for college enrollment C. Increase both college enrollment and the number of students who complete at least a year of college D.

Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding. Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life. Fortunately Rawdon still has Quincey.

Article: In Europe, people hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right throughout the meal, a system that is generally agreed to be more efficient than the American zigzag method. Americans hold both the fork and the knife in their right hands throughout the meal, so they continually change their forks to the left hand when they have to cut their meat. It seems to be funny for the Europeans to see Americans busy changing their dinner sets, making a lot of noises. A few explanations for this American style are as follows: (1) Americans are practical and efficient. Since most of us are right-handed, it is reasonable to keep our working tools at all times in the right hand that can use them most efficiently. (2) Americans, the master of the New World are rebels .They use the zigzag method to break the rules in the Old World and in this way they are thumbing their nose at Mother England. Americans are a restless kind. They do not like to sit in one spot for very long when dining. (3) Forced to do so, they respond by \\"playing\\" with the silver. Whatever the reason for the practice, it is now certainly as American as apple pie. Europeans recognize this and are quick to attack it as evidence of American innocence of form. Arguments against the zigzag method rest not only on grounds of efficiency but also on those of tradition. In Old World dining, the knife is held in the right hand continually because it can serve as an instant defense against the uninvited intruders .However, such alertness is out of place in the New World, as every American believes that this is the home of the brave.

Please answer the following question: Question: what organisms cannot grow on a glucose salt medium I found the following answer on Google: The most common growth media for microorganisms are nutrient broths and agar plates ; specialized media are sometimes required for microorganism and cell culture growth. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer provided does not specifically address the question about which organisms cannot grow on a glucose salt medium. While nutrient broths and agar plates are common growth media for microorganisms, and specialized media are sometimes required for specific microorganisms and cell culture growth, this does not identify the organisms that cannot grow on a glucose salt medium. A glucose salt medium is a minimal medium that usually contains glucose as the sole carbon source and essential salts like potassium, magnesium, and sodium salts for the necessary ions and required nutrients. This minimal medium is designed to limit the types of organisms that can grow on it since it provides only the basic components required for survival and growth. Many microorganisms can grow on glucose salt medium; however, some organisms are unable to grow due to their specific nutritional requirements. Some examples of organisms that cannot grow on a glucose salt medium include: 1. Fastidious organisms: Fastidious organisms, such as some pathogenic bacteria, require complex nutritional requirements. They need specific amino acids, vitamins, or growth factors to grow and cannot survive on minimal media with basic elements like glucose salt medium. Examples of fastidious bacteria include Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. 2. Obligate anaerobes: Obligate anaerobes are microorganisms that can only grow in the absence of oxygen. A glucose salt medium does not contain any reducing agents or oxygen-scavenging components that can create an anaerobic environment. Therefore, these anaerobic bacteria, such as Clostridium tetani, cannot grow on a glucose salt medium. 3. Obligate intracellular parasites: Some organisms, like obligate intracellular parasites, require a host cell for replication and growth. Examples include Chlamydia trachomatis and viruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These microorganisms cannot grow on a glucose salt medium because they need a cellular environment for their survival and reproduction. 4. Organisms with specialized metabolic pathways: Some microorganisms utilize specific metabolic pathways that do not rely on glucose as their primary carbon source. These organisms may be unable to grow on a glucose salt medium due to the absence of their preferred metabolic substrates. For example, methanogens, which derive energy and carbon from methane, would not be supported by a glucose salt medium. In summary, while a glucose salt medium is suitable for the growth of many microorganisms, it is not ideal for fastidious organisms, obligate anaerobes, obligate intracellular parasites, and organisms with specialized metabolic pathways, as it does not provide their specific nutritional requirements or environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"Given the following context: Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast.

Choice A: 1. Buff the key with a cloth to remove excess metal: Using a cloth to buff the key will help to remove some of the visible wear on the key but may not be as effective in removing excess metal. 2. Clean the key with any alcohol: Cleaning the key with alcohol can disinfect the key, but using any alcohol may not be ideal since some alcohols can be harsh or corrosive to certain metals. Choice B: 1. Buff the key with sandpaper to remove excess metal: Sandpaper is more abrasive and efficient in removing excess metal than a cloth, so it can help to restore the key's shape more effectively. Make sure to use sandpaper of an appropriate grit to avoid causing damage. 2. Clean the key with ethanol: Ethanol is a specific type of alcohol that is less corrosive and better suited for cleaning metal surfaces than, for example, isopropyl alcohol. It can help to sanitize the key and promote a smooth, polished surface. Conclusion: Considering the effectiveness and implications of each choice, Choice B appears to be the better solution to ensure that a key stays in good working order. By using sandpaper to remove excess metal and specifically using ethanol for cleaning, we can more effectively maintain the key's shape and function in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Review of Louie season 3 premiere, \\"Something Is Wrong\\" Louis CK and Gaby Hoffmann in the season premiere. Spoilers for last night’s Louie below: In “Something Is Wrong,” the the season premiere of Louie, Louis CK’s alter ego protagonist bought himself a motorcycle. I’ve seen the first five episodes of the third season by now, and it’s clear that Louis CK is driving a powerful vehicle, as well, and the accelerator is jammed: after an already strong second season (#1 on my best-shows list for 2011), each episode is better than the previous one. I am beginning to worry that if it gets any better, it will break my TV. The return episode is strong enough in its own right, and plays like a kind of sampler of Louie’s strengths. I was weeping at the opening masturbation / reading glasses joke, capped off by the guilty assumption about the sales clerk at the pharmacy. (“You ain’t readin’ shit!”). There was the surreal comedy of the parking gag, with the just-ever-so-off street signs. There was the midlife-crisis and physical comedy with the motorcycle (accompanied by one of the show’s occasional montage-love-letters to Manhattan). And above all, there was the brilliant breakup exchange in the diner, with Louie’s girlfriend guessing that he wants to split, and Louie only able to confirm that she’s right–or realize that she’s right only because she brought it up?–only through his silence. From the conversation, we get that April and Louie have been a thing for a while, though he’s been hesitant to get too serious. But the genius of the scene is how the dialogue–or near-monologue–gives us the sense, just through the language, of how old and tiring this relationship is, even though we’ve just been dropped in the middle of it. (“Oh, god, why does it have to be like this? What is this, a game of relationship charades?”) It’s a fine performance by Gaby Hoffmann as April, and another good example of how well the show casts actors who look and sound like everyday Manhattanites. It may be a stretch to say that individual seasons of Louie are “about” something. But if the first season was one in which we met the character, adjusting to life after divorce (the guy we saw start crying on a date), and the second showed Louie gaining confidence as a single father and expanding the community around him, the third seems to show him putting himself out there, dating and venturing into the larger world. (Again, I’ve seen five episodes, but won’t spoil anything for you from them.) After Louie wipes out on his bike (an accident he admits to his ex-wife but is too embarrassed to relate to April), one of the last things April tells him is that he could spare them both a few years of their lives wasted by being honest about his feelings before he commits. Which is to say that getting back on that bike—literally, or metaphorically in dating—means exposing himself to the possibility of injury, either physical or emotional. It may not be painless for Louie, but it’s exciting for us. Over two previous seasons, Louis CK has built himself quite the machine here. Let’s see what this baby can do. A quick hail of bullets: * We see Louie’s ex-wife for the first time, which is quite a surprise since we’ve never seen her before and also because she’s black. (Hispanic? In any case, darker-complected than we would expect from his sister’s description of the ex in last season’s “Pregnant” as a “pasty, big-titted, black-eyed guinea bitch.” When I interviewed Louis CK last year, he said he deliberately avoided showing his character’s ex on the show at the time, and that he took care to change real-life details in any references to her, so as not to seem to depicting his actual ex-wife. I suspected when I first watched the episode that the color-blind casting was a distancing attempt for that reason–and/or an outgrowth of the fact that he’s never cared a lot about some elements of continuity. In an interview with Indiewire, his explanation is a little of both—that, he says, and he simply really liked Susan Kelechi Watson’s audition. * Speaking of continuity, or lack thereof: his niece? Not around, as far as we can see. Pamela? Still off somewhere, or out of the picture? * Having dropped a giant water jug through the roof of a car its first season, Louie now destroys one with construction equipment. Here’s hoping they find another way to wreck a car next season. (And given the show’s tiny budget, good thing the first take evidently worked.) * As mentioned before, I’m on vacation, and Robo-James is posting this while I’m away. So I probably won’t be able to join in the comments section, but have at it.","completion":"The season 3 premiere of Louie, titled \\"Something Is Wrong,\\" follows Louis CK's protagonist as he buys a motorcycle and navigates his life and relationships. The episode showcases a variety of Louie's strengths, from surreal comedy to the complexities of his relationships. It also introduces Louie's ex-wife, played by Susan Kelechi Watson, for the first time. The third season appears to focus on Louie's dating and interpersonal endeavors, illustrating how he exposes himself to the possibility of injury, both physical and emotional. Overall, Louis CK continues to build upon the show's success in its third season, exploring new territory and keeping fans engaged."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: Coming off their win over the Chiefs, the Broncos traveled to Foxborough, Massachusetts to face the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium. This was the 14th meeting between quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Tom Brady since 2001. The Broncos jumped out to a 17-0 lead in the first quarter off three Patriots' turnovers. First, linebacker Von Miller returned a fumble 60 yards for a touchdown. Then, after another Patriots' fumble, running back Knowshon Moreno rushed for a 2-yard touchdown. Placekicker Matt Prater added a 27-yard field goal after yet another Patriots' fumble. The Broncos increased their lead to 24-0 midway through the second quarter, with Manning connecting on a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jacob Tamme. The Patriots then reeled off 31 unanswered points, 14 of which came off two Broncos' turnovers. The Patriots took the opening possession of the second half and got on the scoreboard, with Brady connecting on a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Julian Edelman. Following a fumble by Broncos' running back Montee Ball, the Patriots scored again, with running back Brandon Bolden rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. After forcing a Broncos' punt, the Patriots pulled to within 24-21 near the end of the third quarter, with Brady throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski. On the second play of the Broncos' next possession, Manning was intercepted by Patriots' cornerback Logan Ryan early in the fourth quarter, and three plays later, Brady connected on another touchdown pass to Edelman &#8212; from 14 yards out &#8212; to give the Patriots a 28-24 lead. The Broncos' went three-and-out on their next offensive possession, and the Patriots subsequently added to their lead, with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Stephen Gostkowski midway through the fourth quarter. The Broncos snapped the Patriots' streak of 31 unanswered points and tied the game on their next possession, with a 10-play, 80-yard drive, culminating with an 11-yard touchdown pass from Manning to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, sending the game to overtime. Each team traded punts on their first two overtime possessions, and after the Patriots' second punt, Broncos' cornerback Tony Carter inadvertently made contact with the football as he was trying to get out of the way of a bouncing punt, with Patriots' safety Nate Ebner recovering the fumble at the Broncos' 13-yard line. Three plays later, Gostkowski nailed the game-winning 30-yard field goal with 1:56 remaining in overtime. This marked wide receiver Wes Welker's first visit to New England, where he was a standout Pro Bowler with the team from 2007-12. Tom Brady improved his head-to-head record against Peyton Manning to 10-4, while Manning suffered his 14th career loss in 21 starts against the Patriots. Question: Which kicker made more field goals?

Scottie tries to conquer his fear, but his friend and ex-fiancÃ©e Midge Wood says that another severe emotional shock may be the only cure. An acquaintance from college, Gavin Elster, asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine, claiming she has been possessed. Scottie reluctantly agrees, and follows Madeleine to a florist where she buys a bouquet of flowers, to the Mission San Francisco de AsÃ­s and the grave of Carlotta Valdes, and to an art museum where she gazes at the Portrait of Carlotta. He watches her enter the McKittrick Hotel, but on investigation she does not seem to be there. A local historian explains that Carlotta Valdes tragically committed suicide. Gavin reveals that Carlotta (who he fears is possessing Madeleine) is Madeleine's great-grandmother, although Madeleine has no knowledge of this, and does not remember the places she has visited. Scottie tails Madeleine to Fort Point and, when she leaps into the bay, he rescues her. The next day Scottie follows Madeleine; they meet and spend the day together.

The film opens with scenes of each boy having sex with his girlfriend one last time before the girls leave on a trip to Italy. Without their girlfriends around, the boys quickly become bored.At a wedding, they meet Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the Spanish wife of Tenoch's cousin Jano, and attempt to impress the older woman with talk of an invented secluded beach called la Boca del Cielo (\\"Heaven's Mouth\\").

The adage says \\"a picture is worth a thousand words,\\" but when Leeann Lewandowski happened upon a photograph of her late mother on Facebook after her home was destroyed in Superstorm Sandy, she was speechless. \\"The first thing I see on my Timeline is my mother holding my daughter, Katie, on the day that she was born. I'm usually a very cheery person, but I absolutely crumbled,\\" said Lewandowski, a 47-year-old elementary school teacher and mother of twin 14-year-old girls from Union Beach, New Jersey. Union Beach is a small seaside community with fewer than 6,500 residents, and Sandy hit it hard, destroying nearly 200 homes and decimating the coastline. \\"It was kind of like 'The Wizard of Oz,'\\" said resident Pamela Vasquez. A hot tub was found a block and a half away from where it once sat. Remnants of wooden decks floated in the tide. Family photo albums were buried under piles where multistory houses once stood. Powerless in New Jersey post-Sandy. Jeannette Van Houten also lost her Union Beach home in Sandy, but buried among the devastation she found a calling -- to return memories of happier times to the 1.8-square-mile township by reuniting residents with the family photographs that Sandy scattered to the winds. The day after the storm, Van Houten went for a walk along the shoreline to assess the damage and she stumbled upon a photograph of a couple attending a wedding. She leaned down, picked it up and, suddenly, her mission became clear. \\"Photos are the only things that hold us to the past. My niece was murdered in 2008 and the only thing we have left of her is our photos,\\" said Van Houten. She soon started a Facebook page where she uploaded the pictures she found, hopeful that through the power of social media, residents of the small community would see them and be able to identify the faces and families in the photographs. Since she started, Van Houten has uploaded more than 2,000 photos to the Facebook page -- and she's still looking each day for more lost memories among the debris. About 60 families have reclaimed photos so far, she said. And some people, like Lewandowski and her daughters, have since joined the effort. Read more: Remembering the victims. After all, Van Houten is the reason Lewandowski saw her late mother on Facebook and broke down that day; Van Houten is the reason she got a rare memento of her mother back. \\"My mother, very much like myself, hated having her picture taken. That day, I didn't see anything but a picture of my mother holding my baby. I even posted 'Today is going to be a good day.' It's such a gift,\\" said Lewandowski. Vasquez, who also lost her home, found baby photos of her now grown children on Van Houten's Facebook page. \\"You hold your memories in your heart, but yet to be able to look back, it's amazing,\\" she said. \\"My husband's parents are both gone and we had a picture of both of them in our living room. We don't have them anymore. It's nice that somebody's out there trying to find your memories and give them back to you.\\" Paying it forward, Vasquez has also begun to take photos she finds to the police station to be uploaded to the online forum. Read more: Salvaging smeared memories in Sandy's wake. \\"You can lose your home, you can lose your possessions. Volunteers can help you get food, get shelter, get clothing, but in the end, if no one thinks of picking up the photos or the objects that were miles from where they were supposed to be, people don't feel whole,\\" said Van Houten. As more communities that were ordered to evacuate are allowed to re-enter their neighborhoods, similar initiatives have begun to pop up along the badly beaten Jersey Shore. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast. Jeannie Esti recently started the For Shore Photos Project, which asks residents and cleanup volunteers to collect photographs that were strewn about in the storm surge. Esti lives in Rhode Island now, but she grew up in Mantoloking, New Jersey, where her parents still live. Her childhood home was luckily left unscathed, but in the backyard, she found kitchen cabinets, books, even a little boy's football helmet signed by the actor and former football player John Amos. And, of course, photographs. \\"I grew up with sand in my pants in my whole life,\\" she said. \\"It's that moment where you sit back and think these could be my pictures.\\" For those without photo scanners, Esti has teamed up with local New Jersey businesses like Joe Leone's specialty food stores in Sea Girt and Point Pleasant as drop-off locations for lost-and-found photos that are then collected and uploaded to the For Shore Photos Facebook page. \\"Photography is so common and ubiquitous that we take it for granted, and we don't realize how important it is to us,\\" said Marina Berio, who heads the general studies program at the International Center of Photography. \\"It's the despair of losing part of yourself. Your very memories are being taken away from you.\\" Jenika McDavitt, a photographer who studied psychology at Yale and runs the blog \\"Psychology for Photographers,\\" agrees. \\"We as humans become habituated to our environment. We forget the way that grandma's house looked. When you find a photo that shows those things that you are habituated to and you forgot, it brings back all those memories that you forgot to stop and remember,\\" she said. When Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, Sue Weber of Erie, Pennsylvania, also recognized the power of photography and started The Picture Project. After seeing a reporter on television hold up a picture that was found in the middle of the street of a child in a dance costume, Weber had a revelation similar to Van Houten's. \\"Then it hit me -- many families on the Gulf Coast had lost their entire history in family photos due to Katrina and I should do something about it,\\" she said. Partnering with Kodak, the Biloxi Sun Herald and United Van lines, among others, The Picture Project was able to return thousands of photos to their rightful owners. Weber's revelation also came about because of the coffee table book \\"The Last Album: Eyes from the Ashes of Auschwitz-Birkenau,\\" which sat in front of her during the news report. Weber had attended a presentation at the Erie Museum by the book's author, Ann Weiss, several years prior. During a tour of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1986, Weiss discovered an archive of more than 2,000 photographs confiscated from Jewish families at the death camp. Trying to keep the family business afloat after Sandy. \\"They wanted to bring their emblem of who they were, and they wanted to remember the lives that they lived and the people that they loved. Or even, just remember the people they themselves once were,\\" said Weiss. Weiss fought red tape to obtain the pictures and after doing so, traveled around the world tracking down any survivors, family members and friends that they might belong to. Being stripped of family memories in the Holocaust is very different from losing belongings in a natural disaster, Weiss pointed out, but the end result of both is profound loss. \\"I think all photos are incredibly important because photos are the emblem of our lives. They're tangible proof that we lived, that we're here and when there's a natural disaster -- after the people and after the pets -- what's the first thing we want to save? It's always the pictures,\\" she said. \\"Pictures encapsulate our lives, our dreams, our essence of who we are.\\" Like CNN Living on Facebook.

Baltimore delivered the game's opening strike in the first quarter as quarterback Joe Flacco found wide receiver Anquan Boldin on a 14-yard touchdown pass. After a scoreless second quarter, the Steelers responded with kicker Shaun Suisham got a 45-yard field goal. The Ravens would answer with a 24-yard field goal from kicker Billy Cundiff. Pittsburgh would get another field goal in the fourth quarter, a 19-yarder by Suisham. In the final minutes of the game, the Ravens were driving, trying to run down the clock, when Troy Polamalu sacked Flacco, forcing a fumble in the process. The Steelers recovered the fumble and returned it to the Ravens' 9-yard line. Two plays later, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completed a 9-yard touchdown pass to running back Isaac Redman. Baltimore tried to rally, but the Steelers' defense held on to preserve the win.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which beach had waves with a broad and shallow trough? Hint: When wind waves approach to coast area from deep water, the waves change their heights and lengths.

Here is a question about this article: Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \\"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \\"Papists\\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: What is the answer to this question: Which pope was responsible for the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception?","completion":"Pope Pius IX was responsible for the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception. This occurred in 1854, roughly three hundred years after Martin Luther's time. Pope Pius IX declared the Immaculate Conception as a dogma through the papal bull \\"Ineffabilis Deus,\\" which established it as an essential belief within the Roman Catholic Church."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But Theodor Seuss Geisel---better known as the children's books author Dr. Seuss ---who came into the world on 2 March, 1904, was an unusual man. Like generations of children I was raised on his wonderful stories. But when I now read them to my children it's not just the childhood memories I enjoy. His writing is brilliant and imaginative and flows with a self-confidence as sure as the words of a Shakespeare poem. Readers ride his characteristic rhythm with an effortless joy that cannot be matched by any other modern writer: You have brains in your head You have feet in your shoes You can steer yourself any direction you choose And will you succeed? Yes indeed, yes indeed! Ninety-eight and three-quarters percent guaranteed. Seuss's brilliant cartoons and clever words make his books a delight for adults but they attract mostly children of course. His stories teach kids moral lessons but in indirect and entertaining ways. The first Seuss book I was given was The Lorax, written just as the 60s were becoming the 70s. Seuss was ahead of his time, and in this book the dawn of concern for environmental problems are shown as the Lorax \\"who speaks for the trees\\" battles against an evil businessman who wants to destroy the forest and make goods \\"which everyone needs\\". It's not only a warning of the heavy price of environmental destruction, written well before most people had thought to worry, but it's also a smart analysis of consumer societies: \\"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\\" This is of course a moral message, but not of the kind designed to persuade the youngsters into behavior that adults want. I could go on, but hey, it's a birthday, and I'm sure you folks have some good toasts to raise for the party...

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

We want to call our friends now, even if we'll see them in 10 minutes. The \\"now\\" culture is one of convenience, and let's face it, convenience can make our lives easier. Unfortunately, by gaining convenience, we've lost some of our patience. If you're like me, patience does not come naturally. Here are a few tips I've learned along the way to cultivate more patience in my life: Ask yourself why you're in a hurry. If you feel rushed while going about your normal day, ask yourself why. Will the world end if you get home five minutes late? What if you stop to talk to the random people you meet each day? If you do stop to talk, you'll be amazed how much more connected you'll feel to your community. Hang around people who have patience. I had a lot less patience before I met my husband. Being around him daily has certainly given me a greater appreciation for the art of waiting. He's not only a great example of someone who lives his life patiently, but he tells me if I'm getting too anxious or impatient. If you don't know someone who's patient in your immediate circle of friends, take a class like yoga where meditation is part of the art. _ . Sometimes you can lose sight of long-term goals in the rush towards instant gratification. Most people trying to lose weight have a hard time cutting out sugary or carb-loaded foods completely.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

Primarily known for her work in Hindi films, she has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and English language films. One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India, Basu is the recipient of numerous accolades, including one Filmfare Award, among six nominations. Particularly known for her work in the thriller and horror film genres, she is frequently cited in the media as a sex symbol. Bipasha Basu was born on 7 January 1979 to a Bengali family in Delhi. Her father, Hirak, is a civil engineer, and her mother, Mamta, is a homemaker. She has one elder sister, Bidisha, and one younger sister, Vijayeta. According to Basu, her name means \\"dark deep desire\\", and is also a river's name. She added \\"Due to my dusky skin, I was considered ugly in my younger years.\\" In Delhi, Basu lived at Pamposh Enclave, Nehru Place, till the age of eight and studied at Apeejay High School. Her family then shifted to Kolkata, where she attended Bhavan's Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir, located in Bidhannagar. In her school, Basu was appointed as the head girl and was fondly called 'Lady Goonda' due to her short and commanding personality. She remarked \\"As a child, I was a tomboy and I was pampered a lot, due to which I became very naughty. I used to keep a stick in my hand and straighten out all the colony boys if they acted smart. I used to be very short as a child and I was the monitor in school. When the tall boys would be up to mischief, I'd jump on their back during breaks and pull their hair and beat them up\\". Basu was enrolled in medical science studies until twelfth standard, but switched to commerce thereafter. In 1996, Basu was spotted at a hotel in Kolkata by the model Mehr Jesia Rampal, who suggested she take up modelling. That year, she participated in and eventually won the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest (organised by Ford), thereby representing India at Ford Models Supermodel of the World contest in Miami. She later appeared in the Calida commercial with her then-boyfriend Dino Morea, which was controversial for picturing them sultrily; she had some protesters outside her house after that.

Constantly mocking their sister's employment at a local massage parlour, they spend most of their time joking around, taking drugs and stealing cars. Their father \\"Fatty Lewis\\", falls from a ladder while doing roofing work for Bryn Cartwright, a wealthy, prominent local businessman and small-time gangster. Laying blame, the twins attempt to demand compensation for the accident. Bryn claims it was a cash arrangement with no legal representation and refuses the request for compensation. The twins take this personally and seek revenge by gatecrashing and ruining a local karaoke competition in which Bryn's daughter, beautiful Bonny is singing, by appearing from back stage and urinating on her during the performance in Barons Night Club Swansea. Bryn vows to get even and acquires the help of his associates Greyo and Terry (two corrupt police detectives), to assist him getting revenge on the twins. After several efforts to disrupt their way of life, Bryn appears to succeed by having one of the detectives to assist him in beating up the twins down a back street. As retaliation continues, the feud spirals out of control, progressing with the twins breaking into Bryn's property and beheading the Cartwrights' pet poodle. Terry Walsh responds by setting fire to the Lewis' dog's kennel with their pet inside. However, an adjacent gas bottle explodes, destroying the Lewises' mobile home and killing the twins' family. Clearly upset, the twins make arrangements with the local male voice choir and steal their father's hearse at his funeral. Terry meanwhile, much to Greyo's distress, accuses Fatty's co-workers Dai and Chip of destroying the caravan by placing items from the scene of the crime in their builder's van. The twins soon come down from the hills where they have been hiding out and go after Bryn, breaking into his house again and tying him up with...","completion":"No answer"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, choosing a job is one of the most important decisions to make in life. For my job, there are three important things that I will consider: The first one - that I must work in an area I like - is most important to me. Someone once said if you find a job that you enjoy, then you won't have to work another day. I would like to work in an area where I can be more creative. I would like to be the most valuable member there. All this is possible only if I like what I do. The second one is that the area of my work must lead me to solve some new and hard problems. I would like to stay in the same area for a long time. In order for this to happen, the work must provide enough problems. More than just working to live, I enjoy making a difference and trying my best for the whole progress. I would also like to be well _ for my hard work, so I can lead a comfortable life with this hard-won money. Then I can provide the best for my family. The third important thing is that I would like to work in an area that would help other people. The work in my mind is in fields such as the army, training or management. In such areas, I can help to develop the abilities of others and bring out their best. It would be a most satisfying job to help young people to become the best that they can be. When I become old, I would like to look back with a great sense of satisfaction that thousands of people have become better persons through my work. I accept the idea that no one should make a choice of a job suddenly or quickly. He should decide what he wants to be in the long run. Then, he should decide how he works towards it. He should study the proper courses, read the books and speak to knowledgeable persons in that field before making a job choice. A good choice will most probably lead to a better life.

Timon is a social outcast in his meerkat colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands due to frequently messing things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his mother Ma, Timon dreams for more in life than his colony's bleak existence hiding from predators. One day, he is assigned as a sentry, but his daydreaming nearly leads to the near-death of his Uncle Max by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. This becomes the last straw for the colony, prompting Timon to leave to find a better life. He meets Rafiki, who teaches him about \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and advises him to \\"look beyond what you see\\". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his paradise home, Timon ventures there and encounters Pumbaa on his way. The two quickly form a bond and Pumbaa accompanies Timon. The pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of Simba to the Pride Lands' animals.

The data provided mentions various types of medals won by Morocco, as well as their overall ranking in the event(s). To further elaborate on this data: 1. Morocco GOLD 2: This indicates that Morocco has won two gold medals in the event or the series of events. Gold medals are typically awarded to participants who come in first place in a particular discipline or category. This achievement highlights the hard work, dedication, and talent of the Moroccan athletes who earned these top honors. It also signifies the level of excellence they have achieved in their respective fields, which indicates that Morocco is competitive against other participating nations. 2. Morocco RANK 9: The data provides information about the overall ranking of Morocco, placing them in the 9th position. This ranking takes into account the number of medals, their types (gold, silver, or bronze), and possibly other criteria or factors, depending on the event's rules and regulations. Securing the 9th position in the overall standings showcases the success of Moroccan athletes at the event or events and reflects the nation's sports infrastructure and training facilities. It also highlights the potential for improvement and the possibility of climbing up the ladder in future competitions. 3. Morocco BRONZE 0: The data indicates that Morocco has not won any bronze medals in the event or series of events. Bronze medals are customarily awarded to athletes or teams who finish in third place in a specific discipline or category. The absence of bronze medals in the Moroccan tally suggests that their athletes either obtained better positions (such as securing gold or silver), or they faced fierce competition from other participants, narrowly missing out on the third-place finishes. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that even without bronze medals, the nation still managed to achieve a commendable ranking in the overall standings. In conclusion, the data highlights Morocco's medal count and ranking in the international sporting event or series of events. With two gold medals and a 9th place ranking, it reflects the determination and skill of Moroccan athletes and provides insights into the country's level of competitiveness on the global sports stage. The absence of bronze medals could serve as motivation for future improvements and lead to even better results in future competitions."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Write highlights for this article: The 10 golden rules to help avoid dementia have been unveiled by British scientists. From popping a fish oil pill to enjoying a glass of red wine, the simple everyday lifestyle changes can cut the risk of the disease by more than half, they say. Another recommendation is ballroom dancing - because having to remember the steps boosts brain function, say the experts. Taking up ballroom dancing or playing suduko are among the 10 simple lifestyle changes that can help stave off dementia, Scottish researchers say. Factor in eating well, exercise and enjoying life and you can significantly reduce your risk, say the experts from the University of Stirling’s Dementia Services Development Centre. They devised the 10 easy rules a a way to try and keep the debilitating symptoms of the disease. There are 800,000 people with dementia in the UK, and one in three people over 65 will die from the degenerative disease. And earlier this year, U.S. researchers warned that dementia rates will tripe by 2050 if we continue to live unhealthy lifestyles. Taking vitamins such as B6 and E. Take fish oils. Drink green tea. Drink the odd glass of red wine. Don’t get drunk. Take some physical activity. Enjoy a rich and stimulating environment. Keep your brain active. Dance. Don’t worry about life. Commenting on the 10 lifestyle recommendations, Professor June Andrews, from the University of Stirling, told the Daily Express: 'This is meant to be a cheerful list of positive things we can all do to help ourselves. They are not going to do any harm and there is research evidence that they can all help. 'We know we cannot affect the final outcome. When people are told they have dementia and it cannot be treated, that gives them the feeling there is nothing they can do. 'But if people are on that journey, the message is to live as well as you can and this list can help them do that.' Just last week, Boston researchers found that a rigorous walk could hold the key to slowing the onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s in later life. A natural chemical produced by the body during exercise could one day be given as an injection to inhibit the diseases, the researchers said. The protein, called FNDC5, is produced by muscular exertion and is released into the bloodstream as a hormone called irisin. And Swedish research published earlier this month found that stress in middle age. could increase the risk of suffering dementia in later life. Some studies also show that eating fish oils, such as omega fatty acids, can slow the progress of Alzheimer's. They found conditions such as Alzheimer’s may be linked to the amount of stress experienced up to four decades earlier. Professor Andrews added that certain vitamins such as B6 and E have been shown to cut the risk of Alzheimer's. A regular glass of wine can also appears to have benefits, but the researchers point out that binge drinking has been linked to an increased risk of dementia. Drinking a regular glass of wine also has benefits but the group. warns against getting drunk, as the number of young people with dementia. caused by heavy drinking is increasing.

Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent and mature for their age, met in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of Noye's Fludde and have been pen pals since then. Their relationship having become romantic over the course of their correspondence, they have made a secret pact to reunite and run away together. Sam brings camping equipment, and Suzy brings her binoculars, six books, her kitten, and her brother's battery-powered record player. They hike, camp and fish together in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a secluded cove on the island. They are confronted by a group of Khaki Scouts who try to capture them, and during the resulting altercation, Suzy injures the Scouts' de facto leader, Redford, with her scissors and Camp Ivanhoe's dog is killed by a stray shot from a bow and arrow wielded by one of the Scouts. The Scouts flee and Sam and Suzy hike to the cove which they name Moonrise Kingdom. They set up camp and go swimming. Later, while drying off, they begin dancing to FranÃ§oise Hardy in their underwear. As the romantic tension between them grows, they kiss repeatedly. Suzy's parents, Scoutmaster Ward, the Scouts from Camp Ivanhoe, and Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp find Sam and Suzy in their tent at the cove. Suzy's parents take her home and when Sharp contacts the foster parents he is told that they no longer wish to house Sam. He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of \\"Social Services\\" â an otherwise nameless woman with plans to place Sam in a \\"juvenile refuge\\" and to explore the possibility of treating him with electroshock therapy.

Pidgeon was the first person to do this via the Panama Canal, and the first person to solo circumnavigate the world twice. On both trips, he sailed a 34-foot yawl named the \\"Islander\\", which Pidgeon constructed by himself. Prior to his first trip, Pidgeon had no prior experience sailing. He accounts for his adventures in his book, \\"Around the World Single-Handed: The Cruise of the \\"Islander\\"\\" (1932). Biography. Harry Clifford Pidgeon was born 31 August 1869 on a farm in Iowa. His father, Isaac Marion Pidgeon, was married 3 times and had a total of 12 children. The family were Quakers. At the age of 15, he set out for California where he found work on a ranch. Before long, he traveled north to Alaska, where he took a raft down the Yukon River and spent some time sailing among the small islands of the southeastern Alaskan coast. Later, he returned to California and traveled and worked in the Sierra Nevada mountains, taking up a career in photography. - Sailing Alone Around the World is a sailing memoir by Joshua Slocum in 1900 about his single-handed global circumnavigation aboard the sloop \\"Spray\\".

Problem:Microtubule nucleation is an essential step in the formation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. We recently showed that androgen and Src promote microtubule nucleation and γ-tubulin accumulation at the centrosome. Here, we explore the mechanisms by which androgen and Src regulate these processes and ask whether integrins play a role. We perturb integrin function by a tyrosine-to-alanine substitution in membrane-proximal NPIY motif in the integrin β1 tail and show that this mutant substantially decreases microtubule nucleation and γ-tubulin accumulation at the centrosome. Because androgen stimulation promotes the interaction of the androgen receptor with Src, resulting in PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling, we asked whether these pathways are inhibited by the mutant integrin and whether they regulate microtubule nucleation. Our results indicate that the formation of the androgen receptor-Src complex and the activation of downstream pathways are significantly suppressed when cells are adhered by the mutant integrin. Inhibitor studies indicate that microtubule nucleation requires MEK/ERK but not PI3K/AKT signaling. Importantly, the expression of activated RAF-1 is sufficient to rescue microtubule nucleation inhibited by the mutant integrin by promoting the centrosomal accumulation of γ-tubulin. Our data define a novel paradigm of integrin signaling, where integrins regulate microtubule nucleation by promoting the formation of androgen receptor-Src signaling complexes to activate the MEK/ERK signaling pathway.

Summarize: The trailer, shown to thousands of fans at the Star Wars Celebration event in London, ends with a shot of Vader and his trademark heavy breathing. Director Gareth Edwards revealed James Earl Jones, who voiced Vader in the original trilogy, will be back in the new film. The veteran actor recorded his dialogue in New York last December. Edwards said recording the dialogue had been \\"like an early Christmas present\\". He described how he and his sound recordist had a \\"nerd-gasm\\" when they heard Jones say the word \\"power\\" in his deep, distinctive voice. \\"We said, 'that's great - let's do that one more time.'\\" The poster for the film shows a beach battle taking place on the planet Scarif - with the Death Star looming in the sky. Rogue One tells the story of a group of rebel fighters on a mission to steal the plans for the Death Star.

It is set before the first part of the original series, Episode IV: A New Hope. Vader's appearance had been rumoured for some time, but Lucasfilm only confirmed the Sith Lord's inclusion last month, giving no more details. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said Rogue One was going to be an \\"incredibly immersive experience\\". Edwards also introduced behind-the-scenes footage from the film during the Rogue One panel at the ExCel exhibition centre. The reel ended with British actress Felicity Jones, who plays Jyn Erso, saying: \\"May the Force be with us.\\" Jones was joined on stage by a number of cast members including Riz Ahmed, Forest Whitaker, Mads Mikkelsen and Ben Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn, who plays villain Director Krennick, had arrived in costume - flanked by stormtroopers. He described his character as a \\"smarter villain than most of his predecessors\\".

This molecule has many pieces that can be repeated, like a train with many types of cars. - \\"Ano\\" means \\"yes,\\" \\"ne\\" means \\"no,\\" and we see \\"ne\\" two times so it's \\"no\\" two times. - The last part tells us that the molecule is very big and heavy, but not less than 2,400 Da (that's just a unit we use to measure how heavy molecules are). I hope this helps you understand this big and complex name in Czech language!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plot title: Stick It Movie plot: Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is a rebellious 17-year-old who is forced to return to the regimented world of gymnastics after a run-in with the law where she and two of her skateboard friends accidently cause damage to a development house. A judge sentences Haley to her ultimate nightmare, attending an elite gymnastics academy run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges).Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the US. She made it to the World Championships, but the previous year she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics.After arriving at the school, Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and after that, she can leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport's rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement. Her attitude toward her fellow gymnasts (as well as her past that she avoids talking about) causes conflicts. After getting the cold shoulder the first day at the gym, Haley realizes what she is up against.At the invitational, Haley's talent shines and her return from gymnastics retirement seems for the better. But all is not what it seems in the scoring system. She starts to remember one of the many reasons she retired: the flaws in judging. The panels do not look at the difficulty of the move nor do they look at the technique; they merely take deductions for unimportant minor errors. As Haley narrates: \\"It doesn't matter how well you do.

Hill town was full of gasoline powered vehicles, while Valley town 50 miles away, banned all gas powered vehicles and allows only electrical vehicles or horse-and-buggies. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which town emitted less carbon monoxide? Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Valley town emitted less carbon monoxide. This is because Valley town has banned all gas-powered vehicles and allows only electric vehicles or horse-and-buggies. Gasoline-powered vehicles release a significant amount of harmful emissions, including carbon monoxide, as a by-product of the combustion of hydrocarbons. Since Valley town does not have gasoline-powered vehicles, its carbon monoxide emissions would be significantly lower compared to Hill town, which is full of gas-powered vehicles. Electric vehicles do not emit carbon monoxide, and horse-and-buggies produce minimal emissions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The chapter ordered that 13 canons, including the succentor and the archdeacon, should immediately \\"erect, construct, build, and duly repair their manses, and the enclosures of their gardens within the college of Moray\\". The manse of the precentor, erroneously called the Bishop's House, is partially ruined and is dated 1557. (Fig. 2) Vestiges of the Dean's Manse and the Archdeacon's Manse (Fig. 3) are now part of private buildings.The hospital of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, was established by Bishop Andreas before 1237 for the aid of the poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.There were two friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary was founded in the western part of the burgh around 1233. The Franciscan (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh sometime before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars. The building was transferred into the ownership of the burgh around 1559 and later became the Court of Justice in 1563. In 1489, the chapter founded a...

Continue writing the following text. Megan was a real headache for Elena, because OPTIONS: (A). Megan was always causing all kinds of trouble.. (B). Elena was always causing all kinds of trouble..","completion":"(A). Megan was always causing all kinds of trouble. Megan was a real headache for Elena, because she was always causing all kinds of trouble. Despite being long-time friends, Elena found herself constantly in the line of fire whenever Megan managed to disrupt the peaceful balance of the world around them. It was a frustrating dynamic, one that left Elena questioning the longevity of their friendship. For instance, there were the numerous times when Megan would convince Elena to tag along for one of her infamous schemes. Some of these misadventures included sneaking into the movies without paying, taking a joyride on a neighbor's motorcycle that they had found unlocked, and even trying to shoplift a dress from a popular clothing store. Elena was always left shaking her head in exasperation whenever they somehow managed to escape getting caught, while Megan would laugh it all off as if it were the most enjoyable thing in the world. At school, Megan's antics were well-known among students and teachers alike. Her academic performance was lackluster at best, as she barely paid attention in classes, often submitting assignments late or not at all. Megan's cheeky attitude towards authority was the cause of many detentions, most of which Elena was also forced to endure because of her close friendship with Megan. It wasn't unheard of for Elena to be tasked with explaining Megan's actions to the school principal, who was rapidly losing patience with this wayward student. However, the biggest trouble Megan and Elena faced was when Megan's impulsive behavior started to creep into their personal lives. Relationships were a sore spot for the duo, as Megan's unpredictability and lack of respect for others' feelings often left a string of broken hearts in her wake. Elena, being the ever-loyal friend, was always there to pick up the pieces, consoling those who had fallen afoul of Megan's whimsical approach to love and friendship. Yet, despite all the headaches that Megan caused, Elena couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for her friend's unbridled zest for life. There were moments where Megan would display a boundless energy, working towards a goal or dream that, with her intellect if properly applied, seemed entirely achievable. It was during these brief flashes of brilliance that Elena knew she couldn't simply walk away from their friendship. This steadfast belief in Megan ultimately led Elena to continue supporting her, even when the odds seemed insurmountable. The balance between the frustration of dealing with Megan's trouble-making tendencies and the admiration for her moments of pure potential was precarious. Elena often found herself conflicted, torn between the need to protect her friend and the desire to see Megan grow and mature out of her unhelpful habits. Surely, there had to be a breaking point where everything either came together or fell apart entirely. And although Elena didn't know when that moment might arrive, she understood that she would have to be prepared for either outcome. For now, all she could do was support her friend, hoping that one day Megan would realize the consequences of her actions and accept the responsibility that came with growing up. Until that day, Elena would shoulder the burden of Megan's troubles, attempting to guide her along a path that would hopefully lead to happier times for them both."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The airline has decided not to renew the A380 plane when the ten-year contract expires next year. The news comes after Airbus more than halved its delivery target for the A380, raising fears it could slip back to making a loss from the aircraft.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: Eebee and a friend explore the kitchen in one of 'Eebee's Adventures' Eebee, star of the home-DVD series \\"Eebee's Adventures,\\" doesn't sing, dance or say much on screen. And that's what his creators hope will make him a rock star with their target viewers—babies younger than 2 and their parents. Anjali Athavaley introduces us to Eebee, a colorful puppet and the star of the baby DVD series Eebee's Adventures, who's prime characteristic is that it doesn't do much on the screen. A full-body puppet the size of a 1-year-old, with spiky hair and an easy-to-pronounce name, Eebee laughs and makes baby sounds on screen. He (the character is officially gender-neutral) also plays with Cheerios, rolls a ball, takes laundry out of a basket and interacts with real-life babies and their moms and dads. Eebee marks one of the most ambitious approaches in years to the potentially lucrative but controversy-studded market of home videos for babies. The creators, New York-based Every Baby Company LLC (for which Eebee is named), want parents to watch the 10- to 15-minute episodes with their babies and imitate the activities they see. Parents need advice on how to interact with their child, says co-founder Stephen Gass, whose career includes stints as head of product development for Viacom's new media group and president of the online division at Sesame Workshop, the maker of \\"Sesame Street.\\" \\"Most parents are going to deplete their peekaboo repertoire pretty quickly,\\" Mr. Gass says. \\"What do you do then? Our goal was to be a catalyst for real-world play.\\" Eebee plays with Cheerios and rolls a ball down a ramp. His creators say they gave him spiky hair because it looked like something infants would enjoy grabbing. Many parents monitor and limit their children's \\"screen time,\\" though, and pediatricians frown upon any video-watching by babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently discourages television-viewing by children under 2 (the policy is under review). \\"The evidence is not there to support that [videos] are developmentally appropriate or educational for this age group,\\" says Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and a member of the academy's communications and media council. Studies comparing how young children learn from a parent versus video find \\"a video deficit,\\" she adds. \\"Children will always learn better from the live presentation.\\" Videos for babies under 2 are a difficult market. The viewers outgrow them, and consumer activists and pediatricians frown upon them. Here are some of the more popular series. Baby Einstein President George W. Bush praised the entrepreneur who founded the brand in his 2007 State of the Union address. Brainy Baby Has research it says suggests benefits for babies in recognizing shapes and colors. Sesame Beginnings A series of four videos starring baby versions of \\"Sesame Street\\" characters and their adult family members. It is supposed to model parent-child interaction. In recent years, critics such as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a Boston nonprofit that aims to restrict corporate marketing to children, have taken on the baby-video sector, including the popular Baby Einstein series, whose videos feature music, sounds and animal hand puppets. Activists complained to regulators about the series' implied educational benefits and the potential harms of video-viewing by the very young. Regulators didn't take action. Last year, parent company Walt Disney Co. offered refunds to Baby Einstein DVD customers, saying it did so under a long-standing customer-satisfaction guarantee. It continues to sell Baby Einstein videos and toys. Even so, Every Baby is venturing ahead with a video series it says has a positive influence on parent-child playtime. Content does matter in children's video, Eebee's makers say, and video watched by babies and parents together can have a far more beneficial effect than video used as an electronic babysitter. U.S. sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs for kids declined 3% to 400 million in 2009, excluding full-length feature films, and they are expected to shrink further as alternatives such as on-demand TV and videogames proliferate, according to Screen Digest, a London media analysis company. Still, sales of kids' video have been more stable than the rest of the DVD market. The \\"electronic babysitter phenomenon is really convenient,\\" says Jan Saxton, senior film analyst. \\"We think it's going to be one of the categories that has a long life in packaged video.\\" Every Baby has recently increased retail distribution, with Eebee DVDs, dolls and books currently sold at Nordstrom stores, Barnes & Noble and some 500 toy stores. The company wants to double sales in 2010 to 2 million. Two more DVDs are in the works, and Every Baby has extended the Eebee brand to books and toys, including a plush doll and, for 2011, \\"baby adventure kits\\" designed to help with sand play and other parent-child activities. Two Eebee smart-phone applications are in the works for next year. To create Eebee, Mr. Gass worked with Don Burton, a former head of business development at Disney's educational publishing unit. The two observed young children at play at Mr. Burton's A-Ha! Learning Center in New York, with \\"play labs\\" and \\"open-ended materials\\" such as water, light or shadows. \\"We got a much better idea of what material intrigued kids,\\" Mr. Burton says. The two derived much of Eebee's actions from what they saw the real kids do. Other marketers have tried similar approaches to video content for babies. In 2006, Sesame Workshop launched \\"Sesame Beginnings,\\" a home-video series featuring baby versions of Elmo and Cookie Monster at play with adult characters. The premise was \\"to model parent-child interaction,\\" says Rosemarie Truglio, Sesame Workshop vice president for education and research. After four releases, Sesame Workshop ended production of the series in 2007. Whether experts like it or not, plenty of babies watch television. A 2007 University of Washington study found that by three months of age, some 40% of children watch TV or DVDs regularly. \\"There are a lot of videos out there, so we have almost gone beyond the question of whether they are good or bad, and onto how people are using them,\\" says Rachel Barr, associate professor of psychology at Georgetown University. \\"Eebee's Adventures\\" is a new DVD series that features a colorful puppet Eebee and caregiver Kristy. The program aims to appeal to babies and toddlers while also serving as a primer for new parents on how to play with infants. At a recent children's book-signing in New York's Central Park, 18-month-old Lucas Novembre-Barbosa had his photo taken with Eebee. Lucas loves the DVDs, says his mother, Cathy, 37, an assistant kindergarten teacher. \\"Ever since I've put it on, he's been hooked,\\" Ms. Novembre-Barbosa says. She watches the videos with her son and has borrowed ideas, such as emptying cereal into plastic containers for him to play with. \\"I think they're good in moderation,\\" she says.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A police officer told colleagues ‘all black people look like monkeys’, a court heard yesterday. PC Kevin Hughes, 42, is accused of making the racist comment as he pointed to three black men leaning against a wall. When challenged, he allegedly replied ‘but it’s true’ before arguing that the men were ‘closely related to chimpanzees and more closely related to Neanderthals’. His comments were alleged to have been made while he was on patrol in Newham, one of London’s most ethnically diverse areas. PC David Hair (left) and PC Kevin Hughes (right) denied their comments - overheard by a colleague - were racist. And his colleague David Hair asked a. black officer if she was staying to do overtime or ‘going home to cook. bananas', it is alleged. Kate Wilkinson, prosecutor, told. Westminster Magistrates Court that PC Hughes was on patrol with PC. Costas Dakoutros when he made the comments. Hair, of Epping, Essex, and Hughes, who met at police training school, both deny making any racist comments. Hughes allegedly made the racist remarks while in a patrol car in Green Street with three colleagues on February 22 after seeing three black men standing on the pavement, the prosecutor said. He allegedly turned to his colleague, PC Costas Dakoutros, who was in the back of the car with him, and said: 'Look at them, they look like f****** monkeys.' 'PC Dakoutros looked shocked and said ‘You can't say that',' Ms Wilkinson said. But Hughes allegedly replied: 'No, but it's true.' 'He began to deliberate that they [black people] were closely related to chimpanzees and then said they were more closely related to Neanderthals,' according to the prosecutor. Giving evidence, PC Dakoutros, who made an immediate note of the incident, said it has had a profound impact on his wellbeing. He said: 'It was horrible. I'd heard the comment and it was always playing on my mind. 'It affected me at the time. I felt I was given something that I didn't know how to deal with. I felt something should be done but I didn't know exactly what to do. I just wanted the matter taken out of my hands.' Charges: The two officers appeared in Westminster Magistrates Court where they denied making racist comments while on duty. He added: 'I stopped sleeping. I put on a bit of weight. I was generally moody. I retreated into myself a lot. 'I was kind of starting to doubt the organisation that I worked for.' PC Dakoutros described a culture of racist banter between Hughes and Hair, who were good friends. He. told the court the pair would refer to each other as 'auntie and. uncle'- using imitation Asian accents in the style of the TV show. Goodness Gracious Me, starring Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar. He. also described an incident in which the pair were on an operation with. an Asian female Special Constable and they decided not to use the term. in case she made an official complaint against them. He said: 'K [Hughes] said we can't use 'auntie' as she might complain. D [Hair] agreed. 'It backed up my initial thoughts that these two officers were aware that someone might complain if they heard it being used.' Another colleague who was in the car said he heard Hughes say: 'Black people hadn't evolved and lived in mud huts in Africa', according to Ms Wilkinson. But under questioning the officer denied being racist and said he was commenting on the way a man walked. Ms Wilkinson said: 'He said he didn't recall seeing three black males but said he saw someone with a certain gait who walked like a monkey and he had said to PC Dakoutros something about a monkey.' 'I didn't know if you were going to go into a little rant and say you were going to go home and cook bananas.' - Alleged words of PC Hair to black colleague. Hair is alleged to have made racist comments to his black colleague, PC Julia Dacres, on March 13. PC Dacres lived in south London and so would not regularly work overtime as she found it difficult to travel home late at night, Ms Wilkinson told the court. While on patrol, Hair asked PC Dacres if she was going to do any overtime, to which she sarcastically laughed and said she would. Hair then allegedly said: 'I didn't know if you were going to go into a little rant and say you were going to go home and cook bananas.' Ms Wilkinson said PC Dacres was 'stunned' by this comment and replied: 'That is a weird concoction. Is that what you had for dinner?' PC Dakoutros said when he heard the comment, he initially thought it was an ongoing joke', but 'when I spoke to PC Dacres, about it, it had obviously upset her'. Hughes was present in the police van at the time. 'PC Hughes admitted hearing the comment and said it was stupid,' Ms Wilkinson said. Hair admitted making the comment but said it was not racist because he 'could have named any food', according to Ms Wilkinson. She added: 'He does not deny the statement but asserts it was made with no racial connotation.' The prosecutor also said the pair, who worked in the North East Victim Offender Location Time team (Volt), regularly mocked Asian culture while working, which distressed some colleagues. Hughes and Hair would call each other 'aunty' and 'uncle', common terms in Asian culture for elders, using mock accents 'such as those heard on television comedy series', Ms Wilkinson said. Senior staff never challenged the pair for this, she said. The decision to charge the officers came after an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) following a referral of the complaints in April. The Met said both officers were suspended from duty on 5 April. The case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Question 1: What is friction circle method and its uses? Question 2: Is there any method to make roads aseismic? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Before I answer the questions, let's analyze each question carefully. Question 1: What is friction circle method and its uses? This question requires me to explain the friction circle method and its applications. Step 1: Define the friction circle method. Step 2: Explain the applications of the friction circle method. Question 2: Is there any method to make roads aseismic? This question asks me to discuss if there is a way to create roads that are resistant to seismic activity. Step 1: Define what aseismic means. Step 2: Research and provide information on whether there is a method to make roads aseismic or how to increase their resistance to seismic activity. Now, let's answer the questions: Answer to Question 1: The friction circle method is a widely-used analytical technique in soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering. It is employed to analyze the stability of slopes, retaining walls, and other earth structures. The method is based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, which considers both the frictional resistance and cohesive strength of the soil. The friction circle method involves constructing a circle, wherein the diameter represents the combined effects of both the friction angle and cohesion of the soil. This circle is used to determine the limiting equilibrium of a soil mass, which indicates whether the mass will maintain its stability or experience failure. The friction circle method has several uses, such as: 1. Determining the factor of safety for slopes and embankments. 2. Analyzing the stability of retaining walls and foundations. 3. Estimating the load-carrying capacity of piles. 4. Investigating the potential for soil liquefaction during earthquakes. Answer to Question 2: Aseismic refers to a structure or design that is intended to reduce the effects of seismic activity like earthquakes. There are methods to make roads more aseismic or enhance their resistance to seismic forces. Some of these methods include: 1. Improvement of soil conditions: Compacting and stabilizing the soil underneath the roadway can help reduce potential deformation and improve overall stability during earthquakes. 2. Use of flexible pavements: Flexible pavements can better accommodate ground movements and deformations during earthquakes, reducing the potential for damage. 3. Implementing seismic isolation: Installing seismic isolation devices, such as rubber bearings and sliding isolation systems, can help reduce the impact of ground shaking on road structures like bridges and overpasses. Question 1 and Question 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 deals with a specific method in geotechnical engineering for analyzing the stability of soil, while Question 2 asks about aseismic design methods for roads."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell reportedly said it was more than likely they had used WhatsApp, but there is no evidence they did. Meanwhile, a comment from Belgian Federal Interior Minister Jan Jambon that they had used a PlayStation 4 to communicate was widely reported, but it later emerged suggestions the console had been found at the apartment of one of the attackers were false. It was also reported the PlayStation 4 used end-to-end encryption, but it does not. Encrypted products still reveal metadata - who talked to whom and for how long, and this has played a crucial role in the aftermath of events in Paris. \\"The arrests that are going on now have come from a trawl through metadata,\\" says Prof Woodward. \\"The first person is identified, and then the security services use what is called link analysis to build a picture of who they have been speaking to.\\" The British intelligence service is particularly good at link analysis, according to Prof Woodward And the Draft Investigatory Powers Bill, currently going through Parliament, would require internet service providers to hold on to this metadata for 12 months. But increasingly the security services are turning to hacking - placing malware on suspects' computers to find out what they are doing in real time. \\"If they can hack into a computer or smartphone, then they can find the key to decrypt their messages,\\" Prof Sommer says. Prof Woodward says: \\"There was an IS operative in Syria who was sucked into a Skype scam, persuaded to talk to what he thought was a pretty girl, but she was a cover to inject malware onto his machine,. \\"That was able to head off a couple of attacks.\\" For the past 20 years, there have been concerns a terrorist network could cause real disruption by attacking critical infrastructure such as air traffic control or hospitals, and Chancellor George Osborne has just announced he is going to double funding to fight cybercrime to Â£1.9bn a year by 2020. He said Islamic State militants were trying to develop the ability to launch deadly cyber-attacks, but his comments were \\"vague\\" rather than being about specific threats, according to Prof Sommer. And Prof Woodward says: \\"There are more power outages caused by squirrels than by cyber-terrorists.\\" However, the Stuxnet malicious worm believed to have targeted Iran's nuclear programme in 2009 suggests such attacks are possible. \\"These militant groups are getting much more sophisticated, and you only have to look at how they use social media to see that they are very tech-savvy,\\" Prof Woodward says.

County Sheriff's official confirmed Tuesday that deputies recovered a stolen Rembrandt from the pastor's office of an Episcopal church in Encino. The Rembrandt sketch stolen Saturday night from the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey was recovered Monday night from Saint Nicholas Episcopal Church in the 17100 block of Ventura Boulevard, said sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore. Investigators were still trying to determine how it found its way into the office of Father Mike Cooper and to verify whether it is an authentic Rembrandt. Cooper referred questions to Whitmore. The sketch titled \\"The Judgment\\" was recovered after authorities received a tip Monday evening that someone had seen the artwork on church property. Deputies went to the property and recovered the drawing, which was positively identified by its owners, the Linearis Institute, Whitmore said. No one has been arrested in connection with the theft, he said. \\"We have the Rembrandt at the station evidence lockup.... We are now seeking to authenticate it is a Rembrandt with other sources,\\" he said. Whitmore said detectives still plan to release a sketch and images of a person involved in the \\"well-thought-out, well-executed theft.\\" The 11-inch-by-6-inch quill pen and ink work dating to about 1655 was part of an exhibition staged by the Linearis Institute. Officials at the institute have not returned telephone calls. The institute is described on its website as \\"a public repository for the visual arts specializing in works on paper by great masters of the past 500 years.\\" The artwork was stolen Saturday between 9:20 and 9:35 p.m. when a curator told investigators he was distracted by a guest. \\"When the curator turned back to the Rembrandt, it was gone,\\" Whitmore said. Art experts said works by Rembrandt are some of the most popular targets for art thieves, second only to those by Picasso, because of the artist’s name recognition and the value of the pieces. Anthony Amore, chief investigator at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston and co-author of a book called \\"Stealing Rembrandts,\\" said there have been 81 documented thefts of the artist’s work in the past 100 years. One of those took place at the Gardner museum, where in 1990 a pair of thieves posing as police officers gained entry to the museum and stole 13 works of art, including three Rembrandts. The crime remains unsolved. In the majority of cases, stolen Rembrandts have been recovered, either when thieves were caught or returned the items, sometimes in an attempt to claim reward money after they were unable to sell them. Thieves find famous artworks extremely difficult to sell because of their high profiles and the publicity generated by such thefts, he said. \\"I’d be shocked if the person who stole this piece had any idea how to fence it,\\" Amore said.

Article: Contrary to people's previous knowledge, it's food shortage not dietary preference that motivates birds to migrate thousands of miles back and forth between breeding and nonbreeding areas each year, a new research shows. \\"It's not whether you eat insects,fruits or candy bars or where you eat them that counts,but how reliable that daytoday food source is,\\" said the study leader W.Alice Boyle of the University of Arizona. To figure out the underlying pressure that drives some birds to leave home for the season,Boyle examined 379 related species of New World flycatchers and compared their sizes,food types, habitats, migratory behaviors and whether or not they fed in flocks. To compare the birds,the researchers constructed a \\"supertree\\" showing the exact evolutionary relationships among different species. A computer analysis then determined whether a particular species was migratory because it ran in the \\"family\\" or whether something in the bird's environment was forcing it to leave each season.Boyle and her colleagues found that food shortage was the number one issue that predicted a species' migratory behavior. \\"Food availability is the underlying pressure, not diet and habitat,\\" Boyle said. An alternative strategy that the birds use to handle food shortage is to hunt in flocks, since a group is more likely to find a new source of food than an individual. \\"If you suffer from food shortage, you have two options,\\" Boyle said.\\"You can either hunt with other birds or you can migrate.\\" Question: For what purpose does the author write the text? - Educating readers. - Informing readers. - Drawing people's attention. - Condemning the bad environment.

After sixteen years, the wait is finally over. Universal Pictures has officially announced that a movie adaptation of the spellbinding musical is set to swoop into theaters in 2019. Based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel 'Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,' the musical tells an alternative story of the Land of Oz that exists prior to the famous adventures of Dorothy and her ruby slippers. It unravels the untold tale of two young witches, Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda, the Good Witch, who meet as roommates in college and later become bitter rivals. 'Wicked' offers a fresh and unexpected perspective on the well-known Wizard of Oz narrative. The compelling plot, combined with Stephen Schwartz's unforgettable music and lyrics, has captured the hearts and imaginations of audiences worldwide, making 'Wicked' one of the most popular and enduring Broadway musicals of all time. After numerous rumors and speculations, Universal Pictures finally confirmed that they have green-lit the movie adaptation. The announcement comes in conjunction with the reveal of several key members of the creative team that will bring the musical to life on the silver screen. Academy Award-winning director Stephen Daldry, best known for his work on 'Billy Elliot' and 'The Hours,' will lead the charge in helming the project. Meanwhile, the original Broadway production's producers, Marc Platt and David Stone, will also play pivotal roles in adapting the musical for the screen. Fans of the stage production will no doubt be thrilled to learn that the original creators of the musical – book writer Winnie Holzman and composer Stephen Schwartz – have been tapped to collaborate on the screenplay, ensuring that the heart and soul of their creation will remain intact. As anticipation builds for the film's release, rumors surrounding the casting process have started to swirl. Given the iconic nature of the lead characters, Elphaba and Glinda, the casting choices will be met with great expectations. Although no official announcements have been made, it is expected that the movie's producers will seek to strike the right balance between star power and vocal prowess, potentially turning to a mix of Hollywood A-listers and accomplished Broadway talents. The journey to adapt 'Wicked' for the big screen has been a long and arduous one, as evidenced by the multiple setbacks that have plagued the project over the years. The production has experienced numerous delays, with directors and producers coming and going and fans increasingly becoming more skeptical about its prospects. Nevertheless, with a confirmed release date and an exceptional creative team in place, 'Wicked' now has a clear path to bewitch moviegoers around the world. As we count down the days to the movie's release, there is no denying that the anticipation and excitement surrounding the film adaptation of 'Wicked' has reached unprecedented levels. This wickedly enchanting tale, which has captivated the hearts and minds of theatergoers for well over a decade, is now poised to enchant an even larger audience as it makes its long-awaited debut on the big screen. So, start practicing your \\"Defying Gravity\\" high notes, and get ready to be whisked away to the magical world of Oz in 2019."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the sentence \\"A brown dog chews on an orange ball.\\", is the sentence \\"A dog chews on a ball.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"A dog chews on a ball.\\" is indeed a true sentence based on the initial sentence, \\"A brown dog chews on an orange ball.\\" Here's a detailed explanation of why this statement is accurate: In the original sentence, \\"A brown dog chews on an orange ball,\\" we are given specific information about the dog and the ball. The dog is described as brown, and the ball is described as orange. The sentence describes an action where the brown dog is engaged in chewing the orange ball. The second sentence, \\"A dog chews on a ball.\\" is a more general statement derived from the original sentence. Let's analyze the components of both sentences to understand their correlation: 1. Both sentences mention a dog performing an action. In the first sentence, it is specified as a \\"brown dog,\\" while in the second sentence, the dog's color is not mentioned. By leaving out the color of the dog, the second sentence still retains the essential information about a dog being involved in the situation. 2. The action performed by the dog in both sentences is \\"chews on.\\" This implies that the dog is actively biting or gnawing on an object. The consistency of the action in both sentences confirms the interrelation between the two sentences. 3. The object of the action, in both cases, is a ball. The first sentence specifies the ball as being \\"orange,\\" while the second sentence does not provide this detail. However, the simplified statement still communicates the core meaning by mentioning that the dog is chewing on a ball. By removing the specific attributes of the dog and the ball, the second sentence distills the central action taking place in the original statement. This simpler sentence conveys the fundamental meaning of the original sentence by focusing on the key elements of the dog's action (chewing) and the object of this action (the ball). In summary, based on the given information in the original sentence, \\"A brown dog chews on an orange ball,\\" we can reasonably conclude that the sentence \\"A dog chews on a ball.\\" is a true statement. While it omits specific details about the color of the dog and the ball, it retains the essential information reflecting the primary action taking place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Actually, all you need to do is buy some nice cat furniture and have it in place by the time you bring it into your home. The first thing that you should prepare is a cat house. Two to three feet off the ground is the best height. If you don't have enough room for a cat house, a cat bed is also a nice choice. Once you have a nice spot where your cat can go to feel safe, then it's time to get cat furniture that offers your pet a nice place to play. One nice choice is cat trees. Scratching posts are another great idea if you are short in space, but still want to give your cat a nice place where it can claw at instead of your own furniture. If you're looking for a great way to shop for cat furniture, simply turn on your computer and do some online shopping. In no time will you be able to skim all the offerings from many online stores. What's great is that you can easily compare products and their prices, so you can get what you want at the best possible price.

POST : I (33 M) have been dealing with ongoing issues with a colleague who I will refer to as G (40 F) at work. I am having trouble letting go of the situation and don't feel like I am in the wrong, but would like some validation in my opinion or to hear differing thoughts regarding the situation. Just some background, this colleague and myself have been with the company for around 9 years and have worked together for 4 of those years. We ate lunch together daily, often times separately from people within our department and regularly had personal conversations regarding our families. I felt it was a very good relationship, which is likely why I am having issues with what the situation has degraded too. The company I work for is going through a major expansion and my entire department as well as others has been moved multiple times. One of the more recent moves, paired myself and G in a rather small cubicle. Everyone in the department was in a similar situation, some had more space, some had less, but for the most part was about equal. G was vocally upset regarding the closeness of our seating situation and informed myself, others in the department and our direct report of her unhappiness. I don't know if G ever asked to officially move, but there really wasn't any space to move to even if she had made a request. I was a little hurt that she would be that upset to share a cubicle with me, but I saw her point of view as it was close proximity and thought if was a good cubemate she may be more comfortable. As time went on the situation escalated as she became more vocal and began telling individuals in other departments of her discomfort, many of whom I did not know. I felt as if these people were looking at me like I was behaving inappropriately towards G. It was very uncomfortably for me, but I didn't want to ask someone that was genuinely uncomfortable to not voice their discomfort. I informed G that her saying this bothered me and asked if I could do anything better or different that might alleviate her discomfort. She told me there wasn't anything I could do and that it was just a proximity issue and that it wasn't personal. While I was still uncomfortable, I trusted her and believed she was not being malicious or attempting to make me look bad and opted to let it go and not make a big deal about the situation. After approximately 8 months of us sharing a cubicle, it was time for my department to move again. The week before we were scheduled to move, G asked if I wanted to go out for lunch, I had made previous lunch plans and couldn't go, which is what I informed her. I then saw her go and ask others in the department about going out for lunch, but they all had other plans as well. I felt bad because she and I usually got lunch together and it looked like she was going to have to eat alone, so I recommended G check and see if a friend of hers whom we regularly met for lunch was available, G responding by stating that was a weird and creepy thing to say. I often reminded her to text this friend when we went to lunch and I didn't view my recommendation as any different than that reminder. I had never been referred to as weird and creepy and didn't know what to do, so I just went to my lunch obligation without responding. The more I thought about it, the more it bothered me, two days after she referred to me as weird and creepy, I brought it up again, thinking she would talk about how it was a crazy day and that I caught her at a bad time, or that it was a miscommunication, something along those lines. Instead, she loudly and angrily referred to me as weird and creepy again, I tried to explain that I just felt bad and didn't want her to feel excluded, but she just kept loudly stating that it was weird and creepy, over and over. G was saying this loud enough that another colleague walked over to mediate and try to calm the situation, but he was unable to do so and I felt so humiliated, that I just stopped talking, wondering what I did wrong and hoping no one else would hear what she was saying. No one wants to be thought of as weird and creepy and to be told that by someone at work whom you trust was truly awful. We still had a few more days of sitting in the shared cubicle, I didn't understand why she spoke to me that way and wanted to talk about it, but the way she went off on me was so embarrassing, that I didn't know how to act, so I just put on headphones and focused on work. Over the course of the next few days, G acted like nothing had happened and I couldn't believe it. How could you say something like that, never talk about it and pretend like nothing had happened? I just wanted her to acknowledge that it was wrong or show some sign of caring that she hurt me, but she never did and the last day we sat next to each other was not a good one. I went to work and moved all of my belongings out of our shared cubicle early, G later mentioned to me how she had to wait for facilities to help her move, but I feel like she made this comment expecting me to offer to help. I did not offer, but rather told her that sitting next to her was not a good experience for me, packed up the remainder of my things and went to my new work area. The new area we moved to is much larger, with everyone having their own space. About a month after moving, I noticed G spending a lot of time at the cubicle of another colleague, whom she does not share work responsibilities with. I likely would not have noticed, but this particular colleague sits adjacent to me, so I can't help but see when she goes to his cubicle. On multiple occasions, I have seen her sitting on his desk, much closer than what we sat at our cubicle, which had been a major issue for her. I overheard a conversation, where the same colleague asked her about lunch plans, specifically where she went to lunch and he was not told he was creepy or weird like I was previously. I can't help but view this as highly personal now. I feel like I was spoken about in a derogatory manner to colleagues and that I was called hurtful names, not because of anything I did, but because she had an issue with me the whole time and I was just too foolish to notice. I am so disappointed with myself for just sitting there while she spoke in what I now feel was a derogatory manner about me. I am so angry that I didn't yell back when she called me hurtful names, I wish I had so badly and I don't know how to let it go. I hoped time would heal all wounds, but it didn't, every time she goes to the other colleagues cubicle, it feels like an insult to me. I went to our direct report and informed her (40 F) of what occurred. She spoke to G regarding the issue and scheduled a meeting, at my request, to address the situation. The meeting went very poorly, G did not take it seriously, informed me I was only taking issue with her due to her gender and repeatedly threatened me with going to HR. I do not handle confrontations well and could have handled it better. Some of the meeting going poorly is most definitely my fault, but I strongly believe the fault is mostly hers. At the conclusion of the meeting, my direct report sat separately with each of us. My boss informed me that those threats were inappropriate and that nothing would come of it, that she believed me and other people had come forward with work related issues regarding G. My direct report scheduled another meeting two weeks later, but before the second meeting could occur, G suffered a tragic lose in her family and went on bereavement for 2 weeks. I have lost people in my life and felt horrified that I could in anyway worsen a already awful situation. My direct report informed me, that the second meeting would be canceled and that another one would be scheduled approximately 5 weeks after G returns from bereavement. I told my direct report that a time frame wasn't necessary, to use her judgement and schedule a meeting when she felt G was up to it. That was approximately 3 months ago and nothing has been scheduled or spoken about since then. I still feel the same as I did previously, I just want G to explain why she felt it was necessary to act like that and acknowledge that what she said was hurtful and that she should have addressed the situation differently. I am angry all the time at work and everyday I think about confronting her, creating a scene, forcing her to address it. But another part of me remembers how we used to stop for coffee and that I genuinely did enjoy her company. I think about how G just suffered a lose and I want to give her a hug and offer support, but I believe with all my heart that she thinks I'm creepy and weird. And that she is uncomfortable to be around me. I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable or to worsen any situation. It has now been approximately 6 months, since she referred to me as creepy and weird and I just can't let it go, I think about it every day.

Summarize this article: WASHINGTON – After saying there was no evidence the two had ever met, the White House acknowledged Thursday that President Obama once lived for a few weeks with his uncle, Onyango Obama, a Kenyan who was in the United States illegally and faced possible deportation. The president met his father’s half-brother when he moved to the Boston area to attend Harvard Law School and stayed with him until his apartment was ready, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. After moving out, Obama saw his uncle, known as Omar, once every few months until he graduated. “The president has not seen Omar Obama in 20 years and has not spoken with him in a decade,” Carney said. The update follows Onyango Obama’s statement in court this week that the president had lived with him. The elder Obama was in court for a deportation hearing following a drunken driving arrest. He won status as a legal permanent resident. He came to the United States in 1963 on a student visa that expired in 1970, and he has lived in the country illegally ever since. PHOTOS: 2013's memorable political moments The Boston Globe reported last year that the White House said the president had never met his uncle. White House aides say they actually told the Globe that there was no record of the two having met. On Thursday, Carney said no one at the White House had actually asked the president if he’d come face to face with his uncle before making that statement to the press. “Back when this arose, folks looked at the record, including the president’s book, and there was no evidence that they had met,” Carney said. “Nobody spoke to the president.” When the issue came up again this week, Carney said, he personally took the question to the president. “The president said that he, in fact, had met Omar Obama when he moved to Cambridge for law school, and that he stayed with him for a brief period of time until his apartment was ready,” Carney said. After that, aides say, uncle and nephew saw each other once every few months while the president was in Cambridge, and then gradually fell out of touch after the president graduated from law school. Carney said there was “absolutely zero interference” by the White House in Obama’s legal case. Follow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebook christi.parsons@latimes.com Twitter: @cparsons ||||| President Obama acknowledged on Thursday that he lived with his Kenyan uncle for a brief period in the 1980s while preparing to attend Harvard Law School, contradicting a statement more than a year ago that the White House had no record of the two ever meeting. Their relationship came into question on Tuesday at the deportation hearing of his uncle, Onyango Obama, in Boston immigration court. His uncle had lived in the United States illegally since the 1970s and revealed in testimony for the first time that his famous nephew had stayed at his Cambridge apartment for about three weeks. At the time, Onyango Obama was here illegally and fighting deportation. On Thursday, a White House official said the press office had not fully researched the relationship between the president and his uncle before telling the Globe that they had no record of the two meeting. This time, the press office asked the president directly, which they had not done in 2011.

After that, they saw each other once every few months, but after law school they fell out of touch. The president has not seen him in 20 years, has not spoken with him in 10.” The White House said Obama’s immigration case was handled “without any interference from the president or the White House.” Onyango Obama’s immigration case raised numerous concerns about a potential conflict of interest after his arrest in August 2011 for drunken driving in Framingham. The arrest revealed is outstanding deportation orders and his relationship to the president. Shortly after his arrest, he told an officer, “I think I will call the White House.” Obama is the second relative of the president’s father to face deportation to Kenya since he took office. Zeituni Onyango, Obama’s sister, won asylum in 2010 after a federal official disclosed days before the president’s historic election in 2008 that she was living illegally in the United States, in Boston public housing. President Obama had written in his memoir, “Dreams from My Father,” that he had met Zeituni Onyango, his aunt. But his relationship with his uncle, nicknamed Omar, was less clear. In November 2011, a White House spokesman said he had no record of the two ever meeting. The Washington Post had also reported that scholars believed the two had never met. The White House never moved to correct the record, until the president’s famously private uncle took the witness stand in Boston immigration court two days ago. Onyango Obama, now a 69-year-old liquor store manager in Framingham, said he had helped numerous students and had relatives in the United States, including his nephew, Barack Obama. He said the president had stayed with him at his Cambridge apartment for three weeks when he came to attend Harvard Law School in the 1980s. “It’s a good thing to let your nephew stay with you,” he said after the hearing, adding that in his family, “your brother’s kids are your kids as well.” The president’s father, Barack Obama Sr., had helped Onyango Obama come to America in 1963 to attend an elite boys’ school in Cambridge. But Obama testified that he could not afford the tuition after the first year and graduated instead from public school in Cambridge. He said he went on to earn a degree in philosophy from Boston University, but the university would not confirm that. On Tuesday, immigration Judge Leonard I. Shapiro granted Obama legal residency based on what he said was his good moral character and a section of federal law that allows him to get a green card because he arrived before 1972. The president’s father, Barack Obama Sr., and his family were rarely in the president’s life. Obama Sr. died in a car crash in 1982. The president was raised by his mother’s family. |||||","completion":"The White House has acknowledged that President Obama once lived for a few weeks with his uncle, Onyango Obama, a Kenyan who was in the United States illegally and faced possible deportation. This contradicted a statement made more than a year ago that the White House had no record of the two ever meeting. The president met his father's half-brother when he moved to the Boston area to attend Harvard Law School and stayed with him until his apartment was ready. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney clarified that the president had not seen Omar Obama in 20 years and had not spoken with him in a decade."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Since September, Bana's mother has amassed 136,000 followers on Twitter by revealing the horrifying realities of life in Aleppo, Syria, which led Rowling to reach out. But the woman's tweets—including an image of the bloodied body of a child—betrayed a new level of fear in recent days as she warned that bombs were falling near her home. On Sunday, her tweets became more panicked. \\"The army got in, this could be our last days sincerely talking,\\" she wrote, per NBC News. \\"Under heavy bombardments now, can't be alive anymore. When we die, keep talking for 200,000 still inside. Bye,\\" she added. A few hours later she tweeted a photo of Bana covered in dust, explaining she \\"almost died\\" when the family's home was bombed. \\"In between death and life now, please keep praying for us,\\" reads the most recent tweet, sent around 10am local time Monday. State TV and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights—which estimates 219 civilians died on Sunday, per the Guardian—say rebel forces have lost a third of their territory in Aleppo in recent days as pro-government forces took control of the strategic Sakhour district, which divides rebel-held territory, per the BBC. Officials say up to 10,000 residents fled to government-controlled areas. However, a rep for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Syria says 250,000 people remain in need of help. Expand this summary.","completion":"A little girl named Bana lives in a big city called Aleppo in Syria. It's a very dangerous place where some people are fighting and using big loud machines called bombs. Bana's mother uses a website called Twitter to share stories and pictures of their life, so people in other, safer places can know how hard it is to live in their city. A very nice lady named JK Rowling, who wrote magic stories about a boy named Harry Potter, heard about Bana and sent her some of her books to read, so that Bana could be happy for a while. But then, something sad happened. The bombs got closer and closer to Bana's home and one day, it got very badly damaged. Bana and her family were very scared, so her mother posted more messages on Twitter, asking people to pray for them and not forget about all the other people who also need help in Aleppo. People from around the world are worried about Bana and her family, and hope that they stay safe and find a better place to live."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After back-to-back sub-par performances by the Patriots offense, they faced Derek Carr and the lowly Raiders in their 2014 home opener looking to have their first breakout performance of the season. After both teams punted on their opening drive, the Raiders reached the Patriots 31 and struck first blood on a 49-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. After both teams punted again, the Patriots embarked on a 15 play, 84-yard drive, converting four third-downs, and scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski midway through the second quarter to take a 7-3 lead. The Raiders punted on their next drive, and Marquette King punted only 22 yards to midfield. With the great field position, the Patriots drove all the way to the Raiders 2, but their red zone struggles continued, and they settled for a 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski, giving them a 10-3 lead at halftime. Strong defense continued in the second half. The Raiders drove deep into Patriots territory early in the second quarter, but could only score on a 37-yard field goal by Janikowski. Following a Patriots punt, the Raiders drove from their own 14, to the Patriots 37, but a false start penalty on guard Donald Penn made it 3rd-and-15, and then Carr completed a 13-yard pass to James Jones to the Patriots 29, bringing up a 4th-and-2. The Raiders decided to settle with Janikowski's 47 yard field goal, making the score 10-9. Matthew Slater returned the ensuing kickoff 26 yards to the Patriots 41. With the good field position, the Patriots drove to the Raiders 2 again, but were once again held out of the end zone, and increased their lead to 13-9 on another 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After the Raiders went three-and-out, the Patriots marched 63 yards culminating with Gostkowski's 36-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 16-9 midway through the fourth quarter. The Raiders, though, couldn't muster up any offense against the Patriots and they went three-and-out again, but the Patriots failed to put the game away and punted. In just three plays the Raiders reached Patriots territory, but two plays later, on 3rd-and-7 at the Patriots 30-yard line, Carr threw an incomplete pass seemingly bringing up a do-or-die 4th down, but Ryan was called for pass interference moving the ball to the Patriots 6-yard line. On the very next play, Darren McFadden scored on a 6-yard touchdown run, but the score was nullified by a holding penalty on Raiders left guard Gabe Jackson. On the next play, Carr's pass attempt was tipped and intercepted by Vince Wilfork with 0:51 seconds left, which sealed the win for the Patriots. Tom Brady had his best game to date, despite being pressured relentlessly by the Oakland defensive line, including being sacked twice, completing 24 of 37 passes for 234 yards, with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. The running game struggled, with Ridley leading the team with only 54 yards on 19 carries. Julian Edelman was the leading receiver for either team, with 10 catches for 84 yards. Rob Gronkowski continued to slowly work himself into the offense catching only 3 passes for 44 yards, but also caught the only touchdown. Derek Carr had a sub-par day, going 21 of 34 for only 174 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception. Both defenses were spectacular holding the opposing offense to under 300 yards of offense (241 for the Raiders, 297 for the Patriots). With the win the Patriots advanced to 2-1 and Brady won his 150th career game, 3rd most by a starting quarterback in NFL history.

Question: What does Sam's daughter place on the grill? Movie title: Butterfly Effect: Revelation Movie plot: Sam Reide (Chris Carmack) witnesses a woman killed, then wakes up in an ice-filled bathtub, his vitals being monitored by his sister Jenna (Rachel Miner). It is revealed that Sam can travel back to any time and location during his lifetime (occupying his body of that time in his life), needing only to concentrate on where and when he wishes to arrive. He has helped the local police capture criminals under the guise of being a psychic. We learn that Sam pays his sister's rent and buys her groceries, and that she rarely leaves the apartment and lives in squalor in a run-down section of Detroit.That night, Elizabeth (Sarah Habel), the sister of Sam's murdered girlfriend Rebecca (Mia Serafino), arrives at Sam's apartment. She believes that the man about to be executed for her sister's murder, Lonnie Flennonds (Richard Wilkinson), is innocent, and she offers to pay Sam to find the real murderer. Sam turns her down, but goes to speak with the man who tutored him on time travel, Goldburg (Kevin Yon), who reminds him of the cardinal rules: he's not to alter his own personal past, nor travel in time with his body left unsupervised. We learn that a fire that claimed the lives of Sam and Jenna's parents had claimed Jenna's life, but Sam altered time so that their parents died instead. After Goldburg's departure, their buxom bartender Vicki (Melissa Jones) seductively offers Sam a buttery nipple; he and Vicki have sex, but upon seeing Rebecca's photo, he cannot continue.Sam changes his mind and agrees to help Elizabeth out. He tries to help Lonnie without time-traveling, but Lonnie refuses the help, believing Sam to be the culprit. Frustrated, Sam travels back to June 1998. He first runs into a drunk Elizabeth, telling her to stay in her locked car. He goes into Rebecca's bedroom to find her already dead; while there, Elizabeth is attacked from her backseat. Sam returns to the present, to learn he no longer owns a car, is renting his couch to a roommate named Paco (Ulysses Hernandez), and no longer works for the police,...

In this case, we have two sentences given, where Sentence1 is about an employer competing with a region, and Sentence2 is about an employer helping a region. Part #2: Determine if Sentence2 is entailed by Sentence1. Usage: Since Sentence1 is about competing, and Sentence2 is about helping, these sentences have opposite meanings. Therefore, Sentence2 is not entailed by Sentence1. To be entailed, Sentence2 would have to agree with or logically follow from Sentence1, which is not the case here. Part #3: Provide the appropriate answer, \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\".
