We all know that the history is written by the victors. Well, after we won the war, many ultra-nationalist and secularist intellectuals started propagating about the independence war. This photo was one of the many things that are still very well known and widely circulated in Bangladesh to exaggerate the erstwhile situation and fuel the propaganda machine a lot more. This photo has been circulated all over Bangladesh to show the inhuman nature of the then Pakistani army by implying that the Pakistani army was so ruthless and racist that they didn’t even hesitate to check the circumcision of the common people as a way to identify and separate the Hindu people from the general mass. It shows a Pakistani soldier checking inside the lungi of a man to see whether he is Hindu or Muslim, and if he is Hindu, he will probably be taken away to be killed. This very picture must be very familiar to all Bangladeshis. It was also indicated that the picture was taken while the war was still going on. Its a very common image, and quite successfully it was burned into the minds of Bangladeshis as an example of typical Pakistani/Islamic brutality, intolerance and backwardness. Actually, it is a photo taken by Mr. Kishore Parekh, a famous Indian photographer and the photo was taken after we won the war and became an independent country- Bangladesh. The picture is from a book by the photographer called \\"Bangladesh- A Brutal Birth\\". The soldier in the photo was actually an Indian soldier who was checking the arrested Rajakar members (local collaborator of the Pakistani army) whether they had any arms hidden inside their lungi. However, the fact is that the picture ISN'T of a Pakistani soldier at all, but an Indian soldier \\"checking for weapons\\". The real caption of the photo is like this: So, this is the most misunderstood photo in the history of Bangladesh."},{"prompt":"the response to Ponniyin Selvan II movie a slipper shot given by the audience to the artificial hype created on Mani Ratnam?","completion":"I read Kalki’s Ponniyin Selvan for the first time, as a novice. I didn’t know much about Tamil history. Don’t blame me, I wasn’t taught much of Tamil history at that age. And in fact, all Tamils of my generation learnt Tamil history from Kalki’s historical fiction and consequent fact finding thereafter. The movie cannot be understood by anyone who’s unfamiliar with the books, the context and basic Tamil history from those times. This is not a movie that you can follow without effort. I will give you an example. There’s a scene in PS2 when Vanthiya Thevan is caught by the Pandiya Abatthu Udhavigal and Nandini (Aishwarya Rai) is interrogating him. To buy time and save his head, VV makes small talk and offers information on Nandini’s mother in exchange for his life. He says and I quote, ‘In Thanjavur, you look like the Pazhuvur Queen but in these woods, you look like the Pandiya Queen’. And then you see Nandini draped in a all green, from head to toe. That’s when it strikes you that VV notices Nandini wearing green with the Pandiya team. For, green is the colour of the Pandiya dynasty. Like CSK dons yellow. And why’s that? Madurai Meenakshi wears green. Has a green parrot. And it is said that she was her deity was made of emerald. Now, look at the popular representation of Madurai Meenakshi Amman and even the colours of the Meenakshi Temple Gopuram .. green, green, green. And as I had mentioned in another answer of mine, when I hear Nambi say, ‘Do you think all the Buddhist bhikshus here are real bhikshus?’, i get transported to Sivakamiyin Sabadham, another book from Kalki. Don’t know Tamil history? Don’t watch it!

In UAE, it is usually a business city and most people living in UAE are here for business. Of course there are a lot of tourists so you see many interactions between tourists and residents. The general rule in UAE is you work hard and play hard. In Kuwait there are many government jobs so you see a lot of work being done in the morning and many locals hanging out in local cafés in the evening. So I don’t see that work is done in the evening except for some exceptional scenarios. In Saudi Arabia on the other hand, a lot of work gets done in the evening. Of course there’s a lot of day jobs but companies are very flexible and they allow people to come into work later in the day and work until evening. The culture is quite different in Saudi Arabia so it is not unusual for people to work at night and sleeping during the day. of course there are a lot of the jobs that carry out the 9-to-5 jobs but it is not uncommon that there are people that work flexible hours especially during these days of Covid."},{"prompt":"Which monitor should I use with a MacBook Pro Mid 2012 so I can get as close as possible to a retina screen quality?","completion":"Any 4K monitor will beat the retina screen."},{"prompt":"w would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a female or attend a business lunch with a female, because morally a married man should not meet 1 on 1 with a woman?","completion":"In the short term, send someone with them.

Then work out if this is really a general issue with this employee, or a specific issue with that particular female client. Try and find out if the employee is being sexually harassed by the client. If not, then make a few inquires as to why we hired someone to meet clients who can't in fact, meet clients except under particular circumstances.

Peanut butter is hugely popular in the US because, among other things, it’s relatively inexpensive. Cashews, though, cost a lot more than peanuts, and a quick price check tells me that cashew butter is three to four times as expensive as peanut butter where I am. That’s enough to take it out of the realm of cheap staple and into costly specialty.

American labor law allows employers to do all kinds of things that would otherwise be illegal if there was no collective bargaining agreement that allowed it. Salary caps would not be legal without a CBA. Max contracts would not be legal. Another thing that is legal is that the union can negotiate with the owners to restrict adult, non-union members from getting employment.

But ‘Hindi’ is special because sometimes it does both, it unites a section of people and triggers another section of people. I am a Kannadiga, my Mother tongue is Kannada and I respect every language including Hindi. Nowadays, I am witnessing an increase in the hatred towards Hindi and North Indian people on Twitter. I regularly see such hateful tweets from my fellow Kannadigas. I am unsure of the exact reasons behind these tweets, but they often state that North Indians are trying to impose Hindi and that it is killing regional languages There are various reasons that have led to these feelings, as sometimes Hindi is given more prominence than other regional languages. However, I will not delve into these reasons. I understand the animosity towards Hindi, but it's concerning that while hating the language, people have begun to dislike Hindi-speaking individuals, which is a bigger issue. Recently, I came across a video where a North Indian individual removed black stickers which were on the Hindi instructions in Bengaluru metro and recorded it. However, some Kannada organizations threatened him and forced him to apologize. This situation illustrates how Hindi can trigger certain sections of the population. It's unfortunate that the individual was threatened and had to apologize The British once divided and ruled us, but it's disheartening to see that now we are dividing ourselves along these lines ,Hope God gives Sadbuddhi to such people. In my case, I have good number of friends from North India, what I felt was that they’re really sweet, good and kind people. They respect my language, They respect my state, They love my culture and We Reciprocate. actually I met most of them in a virtual library called ‘Study together’ during my exams and we became really good friends and we all converse in Hindi, as they don’t know my language but I know Hindi. (there are other 2 south Indian people in our group) we created a Whatsapp group of our own after the exams and we played scribble, ludo, Dumb charades and many other games during our holidays and also we used to talk continuously for hours together on Google meet. But Not even once did they make us feel bad, inferior, or anything similar nor we made them feel bad because of their language.

What do I do?","completion":"There are a number of things that can affect your progress and without knowing anything about you I cannot say what you are doing right or wrong so I will just lay out the basics: Define your goals. this the most important step as you are on your own personal fitness journey, you may share the path with others for a while but the journey is yours so the destination is yours. Make sure that your goal is specific with a time frame and is realistic so I want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger on stage at mr olympia in 6 months is most likely unrealistic where as I want to lose 4kg in 2 months is.Measure your start point in order to see progress you need to know where you started from. if your goal is weight loss you need to weigh yourself, lose body fat you need to measure your body fat, strength you need to choose the exercises that are your goals and measure your strength 1RM, 3RM, 5RM, etc.Make a plan. As with any journey you need to know how you intend to get there, and your plan has to support your goal so if you have a strength goal don’t train for hypertrophy, weight loss don’t train to gain muscle. Your plan also needs to include your nutrition which must also support your goals as well as eating healthily your calorie intake must suit the goal so for strength and or hypertrophy you will probably need to have a calorie surplus, whilst body weight or body fat loss will require a calorie deficit.Track your routine. in order to know that you are following your plan you need to track what you do so keep a food diary or use an app to track your nutrition and either an app or training diary to track your workouts. this helps show your consistency and progress.Review your goals. every month or so measure yourself against your start point and goals this allows you to review your progress and if required modify your goals.If you feel stuck or need help then reach out for help. Personally I feel that if it is important to you then you should spend some money and seek professional help at least for planning and find someone who can support you on your journey friends, family, or a trainer. good luck."},{"prompt":"f you quit Quora, do you think anyone would miss you?","completion":"Probably not.

One small example: it’s bedtime and the child is told to drop everything and go to bed. Result: dismay, outrage, tears. But it does not matter if bedtime is 5 minutes later, so you say something on the lines of, ‘Hey, why don’t we just take a minute to do a bit more of (whatever it was) and then we can come back to it tomorrow?’ And if the child would like to take to bed some part of the acitivity that’s fine too. In other words, it can be about finding a compromise, or an alternative, so that the child is not subject to uncomfortable arbitrary decisions by the adults around, and the child has some say in what happens.

We understand the evolution of the physical universe from millionths of a second after the Big Bang, we understand the natural evolution of life on earth, and we understand how information is propagated from parents to children through the DNA structure and genes. For all our progress in the physical and biological sciences, we lack even a basic understanding of how our brains work to produce our thoughts, from every day mundane “what should I do today?” kind of rumination to great art, poetry, literature, and science. Each of us working in the field has but a small role to play ultimately in cracking open this mystery of mysteries. The brain is the most complex machine ever constructed in nature or in artifice. No other machine uses over 50 billion parts, and works over such a long duration, functioning perfectly decade after decade. My father, a world class scholar of ancient languages, is 90 years old. His brain, as far as I can tell, is as sharp and as engaging as I remember it five decades ago. Which machine that is this complex can last this long a time, and work without a problem? No computer ever built survives more than a decade or so before it fails, breaks down, and is junked. Not the brain — this marvel of biology chugs along, year after year, sifting through sensory information, filing away useful knowledge, so that distinctive memories can be recalled decades after they occurred in an instant of time. No hard drive technology has yet been invented that is as reliable as the brain. I don’t have a single piece of computer equipment in my house that is older than 10 or 15 years. They simply don't work or they can’t be used anymore (anyone has a computer that can read 5.25″ floppy drives or Zip disks?). The excitement of AI is the potential of uncovering the secrets by which the brain works, the marvelous algorithms that let it effortlessly process the wealth of sensory data flowing in at every instant. As I type this note, I am listening to some chamber music — an oboe quartet — and I can effortlessly sort out which instruments are playing and the tunes and keep up with the rhythm, while a different part of my brain is composing the words and sentences and the thoughts that underly this reply. Yes, multitasking is one of the signature capabilities of the brain — audio, video, language, touch and many other modalities can be seamlessly intertwined. Whatever OS runs the brain, if and when it is decoded, can teach every OS writer a thing or to about how to interleave concurrent processes efficiently. No matter how fast the computer, and I am typing this on a modern MacBook Pro with more than a billion transistors, every OS I have ever used seems to struggle to cope with multiple demands placed on it, and eventually needs to be rebooted every few days. Not the brain. Yes, we need to sleep each night, but the brain continues its work silently through our sleeping hours, patiently sorting through the previous day’s sensory signals and organizing them so that the next day, what you learned the previous day can be accessed efficiently. Many studies have shown that people trained on repetitive tasks do them more efficiently after a night’s sleep, showing that the brain invented “experience replay” millions of years before researchers in reinforcement learning figured out this trick. At the heart of understanding the brain is our forlorn hope that there are principles of elegance, that such effortless operation over many decades cannot be the result of a vast assemblage of hacks, that there must be a great organizing principle of some kind that enables the brain to efficiently process information in all its rich multimodal quality, that enables the brain to store knowledge so efficiently and reason so quickly. No computer ever built, not all the millions of servers operated by large tech companies with their petabytes of data, is any match for any human brain at the simplest things that it does so well — at imagination, at learning, at language, at learning, at visual perception, at art, at writing, or any of the thousands of skills the brain lets us learn over our lifetimes. Decoding the brain, ultimately, is the goal and challenge of AI. It cannot remain entirely the province of neuroscience, which works at a level far below the one at which the brain is likely to reveal its secrets. Enmeshed in the million odd details of the biochemistry of the brain, neuroscientists are apt to miss the forest for the trees, and end up making useful discoveries that only hint at the complexity of computation going on in the brain. No, as the late David Marr pointed out brilliantly in his book [LINKED_TEXT: Vision] [URL: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/vision-0], understanding the brain requires modeling it at several levels, including the algorithmic level and the computational theory level. What field of inquiry can be more important than understanding how this “porridge like substance”, to use legendary mathematician and AI inventor Alan Turing’s famous description of the brain, drives man and other animals to do all the things they do, to do great feats of scientific imagination, and yes, to horrible acts of cruelty and savagery that has marked our history for millennia. This past weekend, millions around the world mourned the passing of one of the greatest minds of the last 50 years, the physicist Stephen Hawking. Robbed by a disease of almost any movement, Hawking’s brain nonetheless was functioning perfectly over seven decades, and allowed him to imagine incredible worlds that lie far above our direct experience, at understanding how black holes behave, and in his perhaps most profound work, show that black holes are not entirely black, but emit low levels of what is now called Hawking radiation. Stephen Hawking’s life shows how the brain can overcome almost any challenge, if sufficiently motivated, and truly rise above any infirmity of the body to live a productive and fulfilling life. How did Hawking’s brain manage the feat of thinking of the most abstract mathematically difficult problems in physics without the luxury of writing down equations? Hawking himself dismissed equations as just a superficial aspect of deep scientific reasoning, and said he relied more on internal visual imagery to construct his theories, before finding the equations that express his ideas more rigorously. This raises a fascinating question: what is the internal language of thought? If Hawking’s brain did not require writing down equations, what language did it use to enable him to do groundbreaking work in combining quantum mechanics and general relativity, fields of physics that most of us would have difficulty comprehending and working in, even with our fully functioning hands and bodies. Could AI ever construct an artificial Stephen Hawking? A mind that is capable of the most abstract thinking of concepts far removed from human every day experience, that defy our imaginative abilities, such as the possibility of there being multiple universes, of what the universe must have been before the Big Bang, of what the interior of a black hole looks like, and so on. Such possibilities seem like science fiction today, but a true understanding of the brain may bring us closer to realization of this dream. Ultimately, AI is necessary, not just because it will tell us so much about ourselves, but because AI is our only hope to transcend life on earth, and escape into outer space. Sooner rather than later, our mother earth will become inhospitable, due to any number of real or artificial disasters: runaway climate change, nuclear annihilation, massive asteroid impact like the one that finished off the dinosaurs — the list of possible termination scenarios is endless. Even if humanity survives all of these, the Sun will run out of fuel, and life on earth will be impossible. How can we travel into the far reaches of the universe? We will need to transplant our brains into artificial minds, and beam ourselves into the far outer reaches of the universe at the speed of light through radio signals that code our brains somehow, so that our teleported selves can begin anew the process of making a new home for ourselves. Thoughts like these are the stuff of science fiction novels today, but eventually they will become moral imperatives as we run out of choices. AI is the best hope for humanity and other biological species to survive the ultimate demise of the earth, and begin anew our next period of growth in a new solar system, perhaps millions of light years from earth."},{"prompt":"What does NCT 127 mean?

So it’s possible that the information we have is incomplete or may be interpreted differently as more facts continue to come out. Here are the pieces we can put together from what’s reported, and I think they paint a sad, but complete narrative where nothing “doesn’t add up”: Bryant’s helicopter was of a model known for safety and reliability, and was stored and maintained at a facility with an excellent reputation. The likelihood of neglect or mechanical failure was about as low as could reasonably be expected.Everyone who knew the pilot reported him as being very conscientious, and he was licensed not only to fly in challenging conditions but also as an instructor in such conditions, meaning that he was skilled enough himself in order to be an example for others.The weather conditions were so challenging that the LA police helicopters were not in operation, and under most circumstances flight would not be recommended - but was still possible. Here’s how I interpret these facts: Kobe and his daughter undoubtedly wanted to make their way to the game. In retrospect, it’s easy to say that they should have changed their plans and driven, but they likely consulted with the pilot and any other relevant decision making personnel, and the pilot/whoever else at the facility would have had input felt that, while weather conditions were challenging, the risk was still negligible enough. He justifiably trusted his experience and ability. Kobe wanted to make it to the game because he felt a responsibility to Gianna and the girls he coaches. Gianna and her teammate wanted to go to do something they loved. The other girl’s parents wanted to make it for similar reasons. The helicopter was by far the most expedient decision to that end. The pilot has undoubtedly flown in these conditions before and was indisputably as qualified as anyone to make the trip. We shouldn’t blame Kobe for doing something he’d done thousands of time before and trying to save himself, his daughter, and his friends a significant hassle. We shouldn’t blame the pilot for making a judgment call based on his many years of professional experience. Everyone did the best they could based on available information and made decisions that they had every right to make. Things didn’t work out; the results were catastrophic. That doesn’t invalidate the decisions that were made. Given all this, I think it’s pretty clearly a sad, but unquestionable case of human error. Because it feels so senseless, I think it’s a natural human instinct to search for some alternative theory to make sense of it. But that doesn’t seem to be what happened, and I worry that if we look too much for things that “don’t add up” we’re simply going to end up causing more pain in an already painful situation. I hope that none of us transfer any grief into anger and blame directed at the pilot - that doesn’t help anyone and will simply make life harder for his surviving family. We need to help each other move on, not continue to linger trying to find someone to point the finger to."},{"prompt":"What kind of food do people from the UK eat that is considered an acquired taste to the rest of the world?","completion":"OK the obvious answer here is Marmite.

Any vendor in Garter Magic Quadrant will support online learning, but you want to know if the vendor can deliver online learning in a way that meets your organization's needs. For that reason, I can't tell you one that is better than another- that will depend on your organization's unique requirements. If your training is asynchronous online learning, think about how you want to present that information to your users. A few questions to ask yourself: How often will users go to the LMS? Will this be a central portal for your organization or an application users only visit when assigned training?Do you want to create a engaging experience for the user or is it sufficient to just get them in the system, take the training and get them out?The frequency of usage will drive your criteria in selecting an LMS. No need to buy a Rolls Royce if people will only be in it a couple hours a year for annual compliance training. But if your goal is to drive a culture of learning, choosing the right LMS is fundamental.You mentioned CMS features in your question. What kind of content do you want your users to access in the LMS that is not online training? How do you want users to access training on the LMS from other systems like your Intranet portal.Envision how you expect users to access the training and and other materials. Once you have an idea of that vision, take that to the LMS vendors and have them demonstrate how they solve the problem. Questions you and other learning decision makers at your company want to consider as you move forward: Do you have resources to actively manage the LMS on a daily basis or are you looking for a solution that requires minimal maintenance?There are very cool systems out there including Saba, SumTotal, and Plateau (SuccessFactors). But they are big. You can do amazing things with them, but don't expect them to flip a switch and have your ideal solution. Customization or at least advanced configuration are usually required with larger systems. On the converse, the niche LMS vendors are easy to set up but are often difficult or impossible to customize to your exact wants/needs. And so begins the compromise of what features are most important. Which training activities do I need to report on? Completion status, score, time in training, question-level reporting, and the like.Know the metrics you want to achieve and then ensure the LMS vendor can support it.How will the LMS integrate and interact with other systems?Will your company update user accounts in the LMS with your HR system to automate user management?Do you want to connect it to your CMS, Data Warehouse, CRM or collaboration site?Draw up a map of your LMS ecosystem to get a sense of the systems you already have and how they will connect to the LMS. Once you have a sense of what you want the LMS to do for your organization, talk to colleagues in similar roles. What vendors have they liked or disliked? More importantly- why? There are many war stories out there of surviving a bad LMS, but often the company's requirements or expectations were not aligned with vendor capabilities. Once armed with what your organization needs from the LMS and insight from your colleagues, start contacting vendors and share your plan. Then starts the vendor selection process... Good luck!"},{"prompt":"What is the best Indian live chat apps?","completion":"Hi friend, For me, a live chat should be free of any external monitoring or recording from a third party and should be cent percent private.

However, whether she is the greatest superstar in the world is a subjective matter that depends on various factors. In terms of popularity, Shahrukh Khan has a huge following not only in India but also around the world. He has a prominent social media presence and has been featured in several international publications which have helped him gain popularity outside of India as well. He has also won numerous awards for his performances, including several Filmfare awards. However, when it comes to global recognition, Shahrukh Khan is not as well known as other international superstars like Tom Cruise, Dwayne Johnson, or Will Smith. These actors have a larger following in several countries and have starred in some of the top-grossing films in the world. Also, note that the definition of \\"superstar\\" may vary depending on the criteria used. If we look at the box office, Shahrukh Khan's films have been hugely successful in India, but perhaps not as successful in other countries. On the other hand, actors like Jackie Chan and Jet Li have many fans in China, where their films are very popular. In conclusion, while Shahrukh Khan is undoubtedly one of the biggest and most successful movie stars in the Indian film industry, whether or not he is the biggest superstar in the world is a subjective matter and depends on various factors including popularity and worldwide recognition and office. collections."},{"prompt":"What is wine etiquette not being followed by most wine lovers?

There are NO karakamsha or Swa- amsha charts. Here is something further to think about. For that understand the deep meaning of Karakamsha and what that means if you have not already. The terminology may be amsa or ansha, one and the same thing. This we also call inner energy. Karakamsa is a navamsa lord of any Karaka( natural or functional) in natal chart. Have a look at the following chart where i have taken 7th house as focus house of marriage. The functional karaka of 7th house will be Jupiter, 2nd house lord. Now we will look for amsa or ansha - means Jupiter’s Amsa or Ansha. For that, we use navamsa chart. Jupiter is placed in Virgo sign in navamasa. Hence Mercury will be KARAKAMSA for 7th house & Jupiter will be FUNCTIONAL KARAKA for 7th house. Swansha terminology will be carrying similar pattern.

Users want to avoid the prying eyes of governments, hackers, megacorporations, and anyone else who might profit from compiling a dossier on their financial activity. So, can Monero be tracked? What Is the Meaning of Monero? Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency built on a proof-of-work (PoW) network with an emphasis on anonymity. The Monero blockchain employs a number of strategies to conceal transaction data and increase anonymity. Monero, a Bytecoin derivative, first appeared in 2014 as Bitmonero. It was posted by the alias thankfulfortoday on the Bitcointalk forum. The new coin was most likely created using CryptoNote, a system described in a white paper published in October 2013 by Nicolas van Saberhagen. The author emphasized the importance of privacy and anonymity in electronic money, calling Bitcoin's traceability a \\"major flaw.\\" So, can Monero be tracked? Because of disagreements about the new coin's future direction, community members forked it to form Monero. After Ethereum and Bitcoin, Monero has the third-largest development community. One of the two publicly acknowledged developers is Riccardo Spagni, a South African developer currently working on the project. Many members of the core development team have chosen to remain anonymous. Throughout the years, the team has added more privacy safeguards to encourage advanced levels of digital anonymity for transaction data and user identification. The concept, as well as its native XMR token, has gained popularity among crypto enthusiasts and privacy advocates. In terms of market value, Monero is now the most valuable privacy-focused cryptocurrency.

Note that the bolded words are the kinds of things that get voters’ attention. Every Republican or Democratic administration starts out by proposing things that are easy to pass, such as tax decreases or adding cost for some government program they promised when they were campaigning. The hard and responsible part is the cutting of programs and raising of revenue to pay for the things they just enacted. Democrats usually want to pay for them by raising taxes on the rich. Republicans usually want to pay for them by lowering taxes on the rich and hoping that will stimulate economic activity enough to make up the revenue shortage. Then they make little cuts here and there to programs the other party favors so they can claim to be fiscally responsible. Or they underfund government agencies like the FAA or the IRS and we end up with air travel safety issues or lots of tax cheaters going undetected. The truly responsible approach is to accept that government programs cost money, especially if properly funded, and to lead people to be willing to make tough decisions. (I wonder how many would back the infamous wall if they would have to raise their taxes to pay for it. Ditto for Medicare for all.

However, if your gaming is using high dynamic range color, you can get a better overall image at 7ft. Some manufacturers give recommendations, too. For a 50″ UltraHD-4K television, Sony recommends a 3.1ft viewing distance, while TCL recommends 4.2–6.3ft. Sony doesn’t want you sitting at 7ft even for an 85″ display, while TCL thinks you need at least 60″ for a 7ft viewing distance. The other factor is the angle of view. For an immersive experience in either cinema or gaming, you want the television to occupy your central field of vision. The THX ideal distance for a 50″ television based on this, for a 36° viewing angle, is 5.6ft, independent of resolution. The SMPTE maximum acceptable viewing distance, for a 26° field of view, is 6.8 feet.

Looking at Punjab in particular, AAP had set up quite a bit of their base since 2017 when they first fought for the local assembly elections but lost. In the interim period, BJP/RSS led policies in general and especially the mess of the farm laws and handling of the farmer protests, Congress in fighting between Capt. Arminder Singh and Sidhu, Capt leaving congress,, over all mess of jobs, employment, economy, social harmony , hindu versus rest, next to zero improvements in education, health, electricity etc, the disastrous handling of covid by all have left a bitter taste in the mouths of people. They are looking for desperate change and some semblance of genuine improvements in their lives. Here AAP has checked quite a lot of boxes in the successful implementation of their polices in Delhi and the results are visible. It is amazing to hear and see many people talk about how is it possible that govt departments who for decades have been a cesspool of corruption, inefficiency, procrastination, delays, greed and general arrogant attitude towards their jobs and responsibilities towards people suddenly showed phenomenal results that have made a genuine impact on the lives of people in a positive manner. This was the promise of AAP. And they showed wonderful results. The people of India saw this and now are demanding the same. And these upcoming elections will show an insight to how people have voted. Now I will not say it's a sure shot win for AAP in Punjab or elsewhere but I do sincerely hope people realize the garbage and nonsense of BJP and Congress and other local parties have had no major impact in their lives in terms of overall improvement in all these past decades.

What is wrong with everyone?"},{"prompt":"What's the best thing I can do as a 15 year old?","completion":"Hello friend, appreciate the question! 1. Accept responsibility for your actions and learn from your mistakes. When things go wrong, resist the urge to just blame somebody else and ask yourself \\"How could I have handled this situation better?\\". Consciously thinking about how your actions affect yourself and other people will allow you to learn a lot of life lessons. 2. Have an open mind, and make a conscious effort to put yourself in other people's shoes. Realize that how you perceive a situation may not be the same way that everyone perceives it, and when faced with a conflict, try to see the situation from the other person's point of view - a lot of conflicts arise from misunderstandings, if you understand where someone else is coming from, you won't fight with people as much. Also, everyone has different ideas and life experiences, you can learn a lot about the world by talking to diverse groups of people and trying to see their point of view. If a concept is alien to you, educate yourself about it, don't be prejudiced. 3. Respect yourself. I don't mean this in a \\"don't wear slutty clothes and sleep around\\" kind of way, I mean to respect your own opinions, feelings, values, and boundaries - they are as valid and important as anyone else's. Pay attention to whatever advice you can get but at the end of the day, do what you think is right and what you're comfortable with. That's not to say that you should always stay in your comfort zone, it's good to challenge yourself and the only way to expand your comfort zone is to venture outside of it, but venture outside when you think it's the right thing to do, don't let other people do all the thinking on your behalf. 4. Make an effort to do well in all areas of life. The more work you put into your life, the more you'll get out of it. This is common sense - if you work on improving your interpersonal relationships you'll have a better social life and better family life, if you do all your homework and study in school you'll get better results, if you try harder to distinguish your flaws and replace them with good traits you'll be a better person if you talk to more diverse people than you're used to and make the effort to see things from their point of view, you'll become more open-minded, etc. - yet a lot of young people are stuck in a mindset that tells them that they'll succeed and have an awesome life by doing just the bare minimum. You need to Take a break and relax every now and again, obviously, but don't let yourself get lazy. 5. Look after your mental health as well as your physical health. Mental health problems are still such a taboo subject in society that a lot of people will simply just not look for help if they need it, don't be one of those people. Your mind is a gift, take good care of it. 6. Try not to take things for granted. Obviously, you can't be thankful for everything all of the time, but every now and then, reflect on your life and remind yourself of how good you have it that you have a family, a home, that you live in a society that grants you rights. 7. Aim to be the best person you can be, by your standards of what constitutes a good person. Self-explanatory, really. That's all I can think of, for now, good luck and have a great life! :)"},{"prompt":"What is the function of an SAP FICO consultant?","completion":"Here we are going to discuss discuss the function of an SAP FICO consultant.

The one who can accept this should accept it. (Most members of the clergy made it a rule to discard this teaching of Jesus.

There is no positive archeological evidence that Sodom ever existed as described by the clergy to be overly concerned from a rational perspective about most questionable issues written in the Bible. Preachers wishing to find sins of a sexual nature in Sodom do it by faith that fits into their church dogmas. If there was a wicked person in the story of Sodom it may be Righteous Lot for delivering his young virgin daughters to his neighbors to enjoy them sexually all they want. Later, after the demise of their mother, who was zapped into a salt pillar for looking back at the destruction of Sodom, Lot was getting drunk and enjoying sex with his daughters until he got them pregnant. God admits making a mistake destroying Sodom. As judge, he is stunning the world by recognizing a judgmental blunder. Most preachers today do not mention any of these forbidden Bible stories to the public; thus, supporting the homophobic nature that identifies most Christian churches and some secular communities) Rev 11:8 - Their bodies will lie in the public square of the GREAT CITY—which is figuratively called SODOM and Egypt—where also their LORD (Jesus) WAS CRUCIFIED. (Some Christians may never wish to know) Mat 17:10-11 - The disciples asked him, \\"Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?\\" Jesus replied, \\"To be sure, Elijah comes and will RESTORE all things. (Including the fortunes of Sodom) God was delighted watching Lot, a former resident of Sodom, getting drunk enjoying unprotected sex with his young virgin daughters until they got pregnant. God granted him the title of “Righteous Lot” in a way that Catholics approve, believing that every sexual affair must lead to a pregnancy regardless of the type of nations it would produce. Ammon and Moab were cursed of God. Rut 3:7-8 - RUTH approached quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down. In the middle of the night something startled the man; he turned—and there was a woman lying at his feet! (Ruth is a Sodomite-Moabite widow that Boaz is marrying not a virgin Jewish girl. According to Ezekiel, the Jewish girls were very fond of the Egyptian men and their monster size penis. Boaz’s mother was the cursed Canaanite Prostitute Rahab. Ruth married Boaz, she “slept” in between his legs before marrying him. The Book of Ruth narrates her story, she is the great-grandmother of King David who become known as Jesus’ father) Deu 23:3 (KJV) - An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the CONGREGATION of the LORD; even to their TENTH GENERATION shall they not enter into the CONGREGATION of the LORD FOREVER: (“Forever” shows how badly God hates unsuspecting bastards, but in his “absolute morality” God is not angry with Lot for enjoying unprotected sex with his promiscuous virgin daughters until he got them pregnant with bastard children. God bestowed on Lot the title of “Righteous Lot” into the New Testament Hall of fame in Hebrews 11, and fully restore the fortunes of Sodom before Jesus’ second coming) [LINKED_TEXT: THE FORBIDDEN BIBLE STORIES: Skoczek, Lou: 9798391350477: Amazon.com: Books] [URL: https://www.amazon.com/FORBIDDEN-BIBLE-STORIES-Lou-Skoczek/dp/B0C2S59T24/ref=sr_1_3?crid=33QKZ0SUIDOKQ&keywords=the%20forbidden%20bible%20stories&qid=1688309309&s=books&sprefix=the%20forbidden%20bible%20stories%2Cstripbooks%2C145&sr=1-3]"},{"prompt":"any way?","completion":"Self confidence, I believe is a virtue by which even the 'not so lucky' have got lucky.

Power is always shown as pure brutal force. Whether power is just prowess in battle field? I guess not. Power includes physical strength, mental strength, weightage of action, timing, priority, mind state, reputation and also decision making. Let's analyze each by all categories. Bheeshma: Eldest and experienced one in war strategy. Disciple of Parashuram, Brihispathi, Sukrachari. His nature of attacking is always defence first and attack next. Wait for prey to come closer and attack. To avoid more damage, he goes by defence. His immense battle with his master lord Parashuram itself his proof of valour. 10 days as Commander in chief of Kauravas. Has lot of divine astras in his arsenal. His mind state was, he equally liked both Pandavas and Kauravas. He was the one who promised his father to safeguard the throne until it gets in good hands. He always safeguarded it very well. So he clearly ruled out killing Pandavas and slaughtered the army completely in defensive manner to end the war by making Pandavas as armyless. He had boon of dying at will. Boon itself make him more deadly along with his prowess. He served the throne just for the promise he made even he didn't like it. Beloved grand sire. Beloved king maker. Beloved king advisor. And beloved uncle to few. Is he powerful? Hell he is. Drona: Disciple of Parashuram. Greatest attacking battle strategist of Kavravas. Teacher of most lethal warriors in the world. Holder of Bramhasira and Narayanastraand most of divine astras in his arsen. Hot head. He always favour his favourite disciple Arjuna. But he was unwillingly fighting by the side of Kavravas due to the debt he owe to king Dhirudrashtra. When he became angry, mostly no one can stop his rage. Until unless you kill him. His mind set is loyal to throne and he fancies his son more than anything. Dangerous? Yes. Powerful? Slightly less than Bheeshma. Beloved father and beloved teacher of few. Karna: Another disciple of Parashuram. Beat Yudhistra, Bhima, Nahul and Sahadev. Beat sathyagi, Drishtamyum and many other good warriors. He was loyal to his friend as he helped him. His major work what he had to do was to kill Arjuna. He had Vijaya bow. Bow of lord Shiva. Bhargavastra, Bramha astra, Vasavi dart, Nagastra(Aswasena) and many other astras( clearly except Narayanastra, Pasupathasthra and Vaishnavastra). Defeating Jarasanda in wrestling in not a mere feet to anyone. Beloved friend. Lethal. Not so dangerous. Aswathama: Beloved son of Guru Drona. Drona taught his son almost everything. Yes. Almost(except How to retract Bramhasira astra). Holder of Narayanastra itself is a great quality. Only provided by Lord Narayan himself. Even Bheeshma confessed, when Aswathama got anger, even Pandavas may not find it hard to handle. That much was his prowess. Handling Ghatotkacha is not easy at night time. Dangerous? Pretty much when angry. Arjuna: He got Pashupatha astra from Lord shiva himself after a great show of prowess between them. Went on to heaven to learn more warfare from lords themselves and prove of worthiness. Defeating demon army. Defeating army of gods in khandava daha. Beloved student. Beloved father. Beloved brother. Beloved husband. Beloved son. Dangerous? Very much. Until now I considered only mere fights and feats of other than crucial fights. Because not just force and power plays their. The essence of power lies inside warrior when he knows what he does. Let's analyze the crucial events together, Virata war : Arjuna Vs Army of Kavravas Situation: Arjuna must stop the kine from the Kavravas. But for Kavravas it's not like that. They can do anything. They could've even killed Arjuna by group attack. But can they? No. They couldn't. Simply he beat everyone even and square properly. Indivally and together. All of them. Some will say that his last act using Sammohana astra as cowardly act. Well it's not battle for Arjuna. He was just getting back the wealth from group of theives. Kurukshethra war: Let's analyze each others one on one. It's always Arjuna against the others. Since others are not powerful enough to compete these warriors. Not consistently atleast. Arjuna Vs Bheeshma: Mindset in these battles are always to be considered. They loved each other. They had father and son bond between them. They mostly try not to attack brutally each other. Most of the time Arjuna had upper hand. Sometimes Bheeshma had it. On the 10th day. Arjuna held his heart with so much pain to kill Bheeshma. It was certain to win the battle without loosing more army. Because of Shikandi, Bheeshma dropped his arms and standing without and defense of his own. But there were defenders to defend Bheeshma. Arjuna felt huge remorse on it do so. Valour of facing death is so great. Only few people can face it. Arjuna Vs Drona: It was melancholic drama when they meet each other. They mostly avoided facing each other. They share unique bond of best teacher and best student. Mostly Arjuna had upper hand. On 15th day Drona gave big head ache and his head was taken by the means of having a lie. Simply. As warrior Drona shone like a diamond to face. Arjuna Vs Aswathama: Friendship between them was common as everyone know. But Arjuna had soft corner on Aswathama since he was his teacher’s son. Always Arjuna had it unless on Narayana astra. Narayana astra has its own benefit being silent against submission only. And Aswathama's Raudra astra was perfect. Arjuna Vs Karna: Dream for one person and another feat for other person. Here mindset was very crucial. Karna knew Arjuna was his brother yet he had to kill him. He fixed his mind mostly to kill Arjuna for almost his lifetime. Arjuna never failed over Karna on any given day. His battle record his proof for that. Some will say Arjuna ran away from Bhargavastra. Situation speaks here. He loves his family. He went to see whether his brother was ok or not. Since Karna had defeated Yudhistra and left him without killing. Then the final glorious battle. Arjuna had to do lot of work against Karna for last time. He had help from Krishna. Yes it is true. That's what we call decision making. Battle is group work. You have to blend in with everyone and act per situation. So you have to choose your companion(Sarathy) as compatible to you. Arjuna made it with lord Krishna, the most compatible pair. Karna had best Sarathy. But not the best compatible to him. Even in last minute he could've tried to get another chariot or tried fighting from land itself. But Karna was killed. Some will come and say that he killed him weaponless and all. It was not a competition. It was war. It was wrong indeed. But to finish war without most damage, some hard decisions should be taken. Just like killing abhimanyu. They were on full power to do wreck havoc on their any day. 3rd and 9th day of war for Bheeshma. 13th 15th day of war for Drona. 17th day for Karna. 15th day for Aswathama. Nothing was monstrous like 14th day Arjuna. Each and everyone faced him at once and he killed 70 percent of his enemy army in one day by himself. That was the feat nobody damned to touch. Not even think of it. Arjuna did it. All with rage of his son death. By going with words of elders, once Krishna said that Karna was equal perhaps powerful than Arjuna himself. But that was to keep Arjuna in control over his ego. Best companion does like that only. Parashuram who taught, Three commander in chief of Kavravas said it Arjuna cannot be defeated. Lord Shiva said arjuna is equal to himself in prowess of warfare. Demon's and god's cannot defeat this human. Yes. Human. Arjuna was at last human with his soulmate Krishna. Arjuna lost his heart and prowess when his soulmate died. Anyone who says Arjuna lost because he was nothing without Krishna. Ask yourself when you lost your soulmate, can you feel powerful? Even though these things doesn't matter and all. His prophecy when Arjuna born would be great explanation for those who complain. Other were powerful in certain places. Their mental power was not so enough to overcome the truth and real justice over their justice. They all made up their dharma to be upheld. But Arjuna had different thought. He felt both satisfactory. That dilemma gave us the great Bhagavad-Gita. True warrior acts upon the best. But before action, decision is much importance. Seeking knowledge is not lackness of power. It shows yours tendency. Arjuna is and always be the most powerful warrior in Mahabharata. I had taken only few important moments to analyse. If it has to be told of their feats we will be speaking all day. Let there be peace in this world. And I apologize for the grammatical mistakes."},{"prompt":"What are some hobbies that will heal an INFJ?","completion":"Here are some things I love to do when I need to recharge or heal! Listening to music alone. Especially on a long-distance bus ride, sitting by the window and listening to music helps me clear my thoughts and enjoy inner peace.If someone has hurt me badly, I’ve the tendency not to think about the person at all for quite sometime before I go back to resolve it, hence I binge-watch videos on Youtube (more than often funny videos just so I could try to make myself smile a little)Read. Sometimes I read so I can immerse myself into the book and forget about my troubles temporary. I remember picking up “The Little Prince” (sounds like a pretty simple children book I know) to read because I happened to spot it, I felt like I got transported into the world of the book and even better, it taught me one or two things bout life after I finished it. So just any book will do.Write/Journal. I love to just type out a lot of gibberish on my word doc and keep in a hidden folder, then 3 months later I’ll actually go back to read it and think to myself why I had such negative thoughts back them. This process helped me to understand myself better. Most importantly it may help you to heal as you’re pouring all your feelings out when you’re writing(while not being a burden to people coz for me, I always feel like I’m such a burden if I let my friend sit through my rant and sorrows, and I’m wary too)Chilling with my best friend at her house. Both of us are quite anti-social so we just enjoy each others’ company. It feels good even when I’m just chilling with her at her house, watching Netflix, or even just day-dreaming. (Notice how most of these activities are done ALONE as I think me-time is something REALLY IMPORTANT for an INFJ to heal well, at least that’s how it works for me!) That’s all I can think of now, hope this helps!! :-)"},{"prompt":"What's the relationship between ancient Macedonia and Greece? Are Macedonians Greek (not North Macedonia)?","completion":"As is known Greece in antiquity was consisted of city-states and a few kingdoms (οne of which was Macedonia), each one having its own form of governing.Ancient Macedonia, situated mostly in the todays Greek region οf Macedonia, apart a small percentage of it mostly on its south, belonging to the neighboring, homonymous slavic state, was one of the ancient Greek kingdoms, having the same Greek Gods, Greek names, partecipating in the Olympic Games, ment only for Greeks and of course speaking Dorian Greek( one of the Greek dialects). There are plenty of references for Ancient Macedonians from ancient writters like Plutarch who refers to their spoken language as Dorian Greek or references from Hesiodus, or Herodotus, characterizing them as descendants of Timenides, from the Greek city of Argos. Besides all the archeological findings are of Greek art and all coins or signs found in both Greece and/ or the neighboring slavic country such as 👇are also of Greek language Also, is known from Herodotus that although Macedonia was occupied by the Persian king Xerxes A’, Macedonian king Alexander A’ notified the rest of the Greeks for the Persian plans against them because as Alexander A’ stated, he belongs to the Greek nation and he didn’t want to see Greece occupied. {αὐτός τε γὰρ Ἕλλην γένος εἰμὶ τὠρχαῖον, καὶ ἀντ᾽ ἐλευθέρης δεδουλωμένην οὐκ ἂν ἐθέλοιμι ὁρᾶν τὴν Ἑλλάδα}. So to answer your question, yes ancient Macedonians were Greek. The neighbors are Slavs, as many of their ex Presidents👇 or ex PM’s have admitted, and Slavs didn’t arive in the area before 6th century BC, and approximately 1000 years after Alexander’s III ( known as the Great) death. The name of the country in antiquity was Paeonia, which was occupied by ancient Macedonia and became dependant territory. Untill 1941, and while being part of Yugoslavia, was called Vardarska Banovina, until Tito, hopping to get Greek territories from Macedonia in order to have access to the Agean sea, renamed it to Socialist, Yugoslavic Republic of “ Macedonia”. Today, after the leftist goverment of Tsipras signed the Prespes agreement, Greece accepted the Slavic country to be called as North Macedonia erga omnes, under the clear statment though that they are Slavs and have no claim or relationship to the ancient Greek kingdom, that they will change all historically ignorant school books claiming Greek land and heritage as theirs& will stop any attempt to making such claims, they shall not interfere to Greek internal matters and that they will be forbiden to use ancient Macedonian symbols, such as Vergina Sun. For that reason they somewhat changed their flag not to resemble to Vergina Sun and placed signs under ancient Macedonian king’s statues that are or Greek heritage"},{"prompt":"ving at 62, I have no pension.

But his plays are a different story and I've worked on or seen a few of them. Minimalist, yes. Hard to memorize, very. Hard to produce? Easy peasy.

But, his stuff works like a charm onstage when you get it right, even though it might not be to everyone's taste and is generally hypnotic in a very dreary way. Check out videos, all on YouTube, of “Footfalls,” “Happy Days,” “Not I,” and “Krapp's Last Tape,” the latter of which I saw performed live by a guy who was good enough with a reel-to-reel tape deck to run his own sound cues. There's probably more performance video out there, but that will give you an idea…I wouldn't recommend a binge watch, in fact the 15 minute “Not I” might put you off him altogether! I expect his work will start to be more widely produced once it becomes public domain. But he had a funny side as well, albeit a rather pessimistic one. He admired the silent film comedians of his youth like Buster Keaton & Harold Lloyd and their deadpan responses to the quandaries of the world around them. He set up great physical comedy situations, even though they take a bit of thinking to weasel them off the page and onto the stage, eventually you realize they're supposed to be funny. Productions of his masterpiece “Waiting for Godot” often model the characters of Vladimir & Estragon as an existential version of Laurel & Hardy. If you have a chance to see a live performance or even want try your hand at doing one of his plays, I’d highly recommend it! On a personal level, I've had the pleasure of doing live noise art for “Act Without Words 1.” And I got to play Clov in a production of “Endgame” in college. I had the only blocking in the show.

Fluctuations in blood sugar levels can lead to various health complications, making it essential to adopt effective strategies to keep them in check. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into a range of proven techniques and lifestyle changes to help you gain better control over your blood sugar levels and lead a healthier life. Understanding Blood Sugar Levels Before we dive into the strategies for managing blood sugar, it's important to understand what blood sugar levels are and how they affect your body. Blood sugar, or glucose, is the primary source of energy for your cells. It comes from the food you eat and is regulated by the hormone insulin, which is produced by the pancreas. The Impact of Diet on Blood Sugar A balanced diet plays a pivotal role in maintaining stable blood sugar levels. Opt for complex carbohydrates with a low glycemic index, such as whole grains, vegetables, and legumes. These foods are digested more slowly, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar. Incorporating lean proteins, healthy fats, and plenty of fiber into your meals can also help stabilize blood sugar levels. Regular Physical Activity Engaging in regular physical activity offers numerous benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity and better blood sugar control. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week, coupled with strength training exercises. This can enhance glucose uptake by your muscles and contribute to more stable blood sugar levels. Effective Stress Management Chronic stress can lead to elevated blood sugar levels due to the release of stress hormones like cortisol. Practicing stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and yoga can help lower stress levels and positively impact blood sugar regulation. Quality Sleep Sleep plays a vital role in maintaining overall health, including blood sugar management. Poor sleep patterns can disrupt insulin sensitivity, leading to imbalanced blood sugar levels. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support optimal blood sugar control. Medication and Monitoring For individuals with diabetes or other medical conditions that affect blood sugar levels, medication may be necessary. It's important to work closely with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate medication regimen. Regular blood sugar monitoring is also essential to track your progress and make any necessary adjustments. The Importance of Hydration Staying adequately hydrated is often overlooked but can have a significant impact on blood sugar levels. Drinking water helps flush out excess sugar through urine and supports the overall functioning of your body's cells. Conclusion In conclusion, maintaining optimal blood sugar levels is a critical aspect of overall health and well-being. By adopting a holistic approach that includes a balanced diet, regular physical activity, effective stress management, quality sleep, and appropriate medication when necessary, you can take charge of your blood sugar levels and lead a healthier, more fulfilling life. Remember that consistency is key, and working closely with healthcare professionals can provide you with the guidance and support needed on your journey to better blood sugar control."},{"prompt":"What is the biggest problem with the modern education system?","completion":"Q: “What is the major issue in the US education system?” The major issue is that they do not consult the student’s understanding. This one issue then complicates things and you get nearly all the other issues. When one understands something they have a clear and true idea or notion of something, or full and exact knowledge of something. This is the result of a process. Q: \\"What do you think is the biggest flaw in the traditional American education system?\\" Not defining words properly. Anyone was doing well in education at some point, actually many points. Here is what I mean by \\"doing well.\\" \\"A student should be flying along, feeling brilliant, enthusiastic, fully understanding what they are learning, without stress or strain, able to recall and apply what one has learned.\\" So what happens at that precise, very exact, point when any, every, person begins to not be doing well? They go past a word that was not properly defined. Their understanding was not present. What is the proof of this? You just locate and properly define the exact word that they missed. They return to doing well in that subject. This can be done for each and every subject, and the person is then doing well in all subjects, again. For high school students, I estimate this could be done in 8 to 16 hours, one to two days. American education is not doing this. They have been rejecting doing this. It has been known since 1964. It has been available to the public, American education, since 1969. This is a simple idea. It has a simple solution. The real challenge to American education is HOW DO YOU KEEP a student doing well? I took a study course recently, it is designed to be completed in 2 weeks, 80 hours. This course gives the student the ability to keep themselves doing well. If American education contracted for and had delivered to each student in America, this ability to keep themselves doing well, that would be the biggest success ever, of American education.

Unlike most of the Marvel superheroes, Cap didn’t find his powers in a freak accident, or create them with his genius, or stumble upon them through a magical object. Instead, he was given these powers as a mark of his merit. He was chosen to receive these powers for the spirit, determination, and courage he showed well before he had any kind of power. Because at one point, Cap was just a weakling. He was unusually small, thin, and had dealt with numerous health conditions his entire life. And yet, he chose to use what little strength he had to stand up to bullies. That kind of character is rare. It’s hard enough to find those willing to stand up to bullies when they have the power to do so, but for someone far weaker than normal? Even rarer. But that’s the kind of man Steve Rogers has always been. That’s the kind of man the super-soldier serum only enhanced, increasing everything from his strength to his courage, building upon the hero he had always been rather than creating one that wasn’t there. And it’s a good thing it did, because even with his newfound powers, Captain America constantly faced threats and villains well past his power level. Loki was too much for him: Ultron was too much for him: Iron Man was too much for him, alone: Thanos was too much for him the first time: And the second time: Yet somehow, every time, Cap picked himself up, dusted himself off, and came back for more. Because no matter how outmatched he was, he always gave his all. He was a man against gods, facing warriors with 10x his ability and strength, but he never backed down. Cap’s greatest moment of triumph came in Endgame. He had been beaten to a bloody pulp by Thanos, his shield had been torn to pieces, and his friends had been tossed about. But what did he do? He staggered to his feet, fought the pain with gritted teeth, and stood in the face of Thanos and his entire army.

As a kid, I was as euphoric and ecstatic as anyone could get about the freedom movement. Fed with oodles and oodles of history, carefully peppered (rightfully so) with feats of Indian freedom fighters, I always looked down upon folks from my grand father's generation who weren't jailed for their participation in the freedom moment. But my grand-dad was never jailed nor did he even agitate against the British. Like most of his coevals, he had a cushy job as a teacher, his children went to decent state run schools and he never really suffered any sort of brutality - British or otherwise (read Nizams). Infact, he was never really ruled by the British directly - it took a while for me to get my head around this fact. Most of present day Karnataka is the erstwhile princely state of Mysore (red colored part in the map) ruled by the Wodeyars. Like the other princely states of that day, the Wodeyars were subsidiaries of the British Empire and thereby enjoyed regional monarchy.From what I gather, based on my lengthy conversations with my father-in-law whose grandfather served as the royal physician to the Wodeyars, the similarity with the other princely states ends at the titular fact. Even to this day, the Wodeyars of Mysore, are considered one of the best administrators of the state. Always at the forefront of technology and development, Mysore's was considered a liberal, pluralistic administration. So much so that the Kingdom of Mysore under the reigns of [LINKED_TEXT: Maharaja] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja] [LINKED_TEXT: Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV (Nalwadi)] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Raja_Wadiyar_IV] and[LINKED_TEXT: Sir Mirza Ismail] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Ismail] was known as \\"the golden age of Mysore\\", prompting Mahatma Gandhi to call it \\"Ram Rajya\\", implying they were like brothers and despite their religious backgrounds they put the welfare of the people of the state above all else. An ideal which he later lamented Nehru and Jinnah could never achieve. Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar Sir Mirja Ismail - Diwan of Mysore. Under Nalwadi's rule, the state of Mysore saw immense development. Infra projects like the hydel project at Jog, Brindavan gardens of Mysore, many hospitals including the famous Vani Vilas Hospital, several dams, who can forget the legendary, venerable KRS dam. The biggest open market of Bangalore i.e., K.R. Market was his handiwork and his namesake.Education institutes like the IISc, UVCE, Mysore university, Mysore Medical College, Maharani's College for Women, Maharani's Science College for women etcIndustries like HAL, Vishveshwariah Iron and Steel plant, Govt Sandalwood Oil factory - maker of the famous Mysore Sandal soap, Mysore silks, Mysore Lamps, Mysore Chemical and Fertilizers ... the list is endless. Administrative/commerce institutes like Mysore legislative council, Mysore chamber of commerce, State Bank of Mysore, Mysore state railways etc.Cultural/religious institutes like Kannada Sahithya Parishad, St Philomena's church etc Some of the best institutions that are still unparalleled even today! Nalwadi invested in human capital and his people rewarded him with near absolute loyalty. And did I say that Nalwadi ruled from 1894-1940? Exactly the time when the freedom movement was taking shape elsewhere in the country. At his behest, Sir Mirja Ismail had to do a great deal of tight-rope walking in the face of popular agitations conducted by the Congress Party. Whilst maintaining good relations with the top Congress leaders like Gandhi and Nehru, he did everything possible to suppress Congress movement in the state for fear of communal violence and unrest that could mess the relationship with the British and thereby quell Nalwadi's monarchy. It was this very fear which came to the fore over Sultanpet Ganapathi Disturbances in Bangalore in 1928, this upheaval created the long desired opportunity the Congress desired and they finally gained ground in the elusive state of Mysore also. To put things in perspective, Kannadigas lived in the Hotel Grand Budapest of that era. Sans the democracy and Purna Swaraj, the residents were devoid of any oppression that their compatriots elsewhere were subjected to. Kannadigas didn't have to migrate for better prospects or if you don't look at it under the altruistic lens of nationalism, Kannadigas didn't have to agitate for freedom or had no hiccups in learning an additional language like Hindi, for their language was the language of the state and that made them very secure. Not so the case elsewhere in India and not even in South India. Post independence Karnataka reaped the benefits of Nalwadi's rule. Due to the excellent infrastructure and abundance of human capital it also attracted one of the best investments of socialist India - PSUs. BHEL, BEL, BEML, HMT, NAL, DRDO - name the PSU, it's possible that it's headquartered in Bangalore. That eventually gave way to the software revolution. Like [LINKED_TEXT: Dr. Balaji Viswanathan (பாலாஜி விஸ்வநாதன்)] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Dr-Balaji-Viswanathan] has mentioned, Kannadigas didn't ship out - so, no one knew of the Kannadigas or the utopia they lived in at that time. That trend sort of continued. Fun fact - Banaras Hindu University was founded by Madan Mohan Malavia, inspired by that Sir M V and Nalmadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar planned for Mysore university."},{"prompt":"Iraq better off today than

50 dollars everyone is starving people had to hide their kids otherwise saddam will take them or kill em, like the teenagers saddam lost the war, more than that he lost his people on his last days he invaded Kuwait and hit 4 missles on saudi, because he flipped on america, and apologised to iran, and told all iraqis who escaped that you can come back, and we apologise, because he had lost his army, and now wants people to fight for him for the next war he was going to take against american allies after he realised his mistake with iran and his people unfortunately it was too late, last 5 min wont do anything. by that time america was shitless that saddam will attack isreal and their allies, so they knew the time has come to take their own monster puppet down, who opened the doors for them to stay in iraq till ths day, to feed off the oil, that oil also helped em build las vegas, and yeah that was about it for the iraqis the end of Iraq, their familes got killed by some coward who escaped to the hole, then got taken by the americans for a beat up, then got another beat up for 3 years in iraqi jail, meanwhile tried to play it as a motivational speaker for the arabs, yet after all humiliation he died a miserable death. have you seen a president who sits in a cage, and tries to hide in a hole, he didnt have the balls to hold his gun and die on his ground, between his people, but he had the balls to kill families, womens, kids who were innocent and do wars, even his sons fought the army for hours before they leave this life, and yes that was the end for this miserable coward dog he killed from half of Baghdad people all the way to the south, yet the other half of baghdad was to the east was living a lavish life, everything they have free, they didnt go through any of these circumstances, it was like half hell, and half heaven, yet they were the ones who snitched on him and batryed him hardly, his own people batryed him after he was feeding them the americans raped their mums and daughters, which they deserve because all their man killed millons of people from the other side, and till this day they love him, if you love him so much, why you batryed him, if saddam choice us from the other half, we wouldve never batryed him, yet that cant be happening because he wouldnt choose the good ones. if saddam wouldve went out one more time, he wouldve had the biggest revenge on his people, which he shouldve killed the first ones, yet he choose to kill the good iraqis and their families, and the other side of kurds all my family, family friend were behind the stage of his court trial, and we questioned him, and we witnessed his death when i witnessed his death i was 9 years old, my dad was telling me we took this bastard dog down, fk him and his people and you dont want to know the amount of people who beat him up, they used to walk him with punches and kicks and return him to his cell with punches and kicks if he committed suicide wouldve been better after his death it was like eid for us, 70% Muslims iraqi were happy, iraqi jews were happy, some iraqi Christians were happy, kurds were happy, most were happy, everyone was out in the street celebrating, and giving out food, candy etc… but it was actually eid, they killed him on eid morning 4am, but it was 10x times the happiness of Christmas, easter, and eid all added up together but you had 30% muslims iraqi who were extremely sad also a quite lot of Christians, and yazeedis, they loved him because he was feeding them, and the rest of all gulf arabs and syria, jordan were sad, the pigs they still love him till this day from how much they love him, you wonder if they worship him, hes a god and a hero to them only the iraqis in heazb aldawoua and the good ones knows the reality of saddam and his people and the iraqi histroy, where saddam came from and how he got in power. if you wondering why saddam didnt hold his gun, and fight instead, he choice the humiliation from the americans and the iraqis, you must be asking why would someone want this, why someone as great as a president who was making all arabs, shut up at a meeting will want to go through this, its simple saddam knows very well that theres god and heaven and hell after this life, theres consequences for someone action regarding his religion or beliefs, he came to a point where his mind is thinking of death, oh whats going to happen to me after death, i will be in hell for eternal life, why did i choose this path, i cant go back now, he was in mental situation where he didnt care about anything, and the only thing in his mind, how will he face god, after killing 4 million iraqis, throwing them over buildings, burying alive people in groups, putting people in poisonous chemicals where their bones and skin melt away, not even they give the bodies to their family, he done it to a shia scholar, he was torturing people, where he had 3 rooms, filled with guards, ones goes in each room and gets tortured by all guards, some died of that, he was putting people in the boot of the cars under the sun for days, he drilled people, cut their ears, nose, he used the chainsaw and cut people arms and legs, they used to put ones and hit him with the back of the gun on his head till his brain parts falls out, saddam was the devil himself, if in thw after life god decides to forgive the devil, he wont forgive saddam, thats why when the end was coming saddam was scared asf he didnt think of anything but death, he thought the end was far, he had power for 30 years and thought through it that it wont finish and i will be like this forever, theres a saying says you dont know what man you are, until death approches you, those who died im pretty sure god wanted them in heaven, those who were saddam puppets they will have a special level of hell for them. the worse part is that not only men went through it but womens and kids too. i dare anyone of his lovers to go on youtube and see his tortures, to see how he made people suffer, at least i dare them to watch it for 2 min, when i was a kid my dad got me CD's it was iran made, iran gave it to people so they can see who saddam is, and

correctness. No, I’m serious. Don’t scroll away from this answer because I’ll explain this in more detail and why this is harmful, especially for the student. Again, I won’t say bad stuff about liberals in general, but more about how political correctness is ruining the education system and making people feel disenfranchised. Why does political correctness make education bad? I’ll explain. It has to with a multitude of different ideas. But one of the biggest is this notion of “diversity”. Don’t get me wrong here, I think diversity is great when it’s not forced. Forced uniformity is not good either, but you don’t see much of that anymore. Forced diversity it absolutely cringe and seriously ruins the educational experience for students. You know why? No, it’s not because of forced diversity within the student populace, but rather the staff diversity. Recently, there have been numerous measures of increasing the staff diversity forcefully. Is this not basically a racial quota? Yet, it gets away, namely in extremely liberal states such as California and New York. And to prove that this is not a one time thing, I’ll tell you about one of my experiences with this “diversifying” of staff in schools. Recently, in a School district board meeting, one of the speakers said, and I quote: “One of our goals for next school year should be making the POC percentage of the staff from 15% to 23%”. The numbers are not the exact same that I heard, but they were similar. One of the biggest consequences of this is that it really does harm the students education. When you’re not hiring based on competency, and instead of what skin color you are, you’re Being racistDirectly reducing the capacity of the staff of your school Now, I’m not surprised that they do this, as it is clear that public education in America has been on the downfall for quite some time — it doesn’t even show up as a main issue on debates anymore! — but I didn’t think they’d go this low. When you resort to these diversity tactics to please your government/corporate overlords, you’re getting a raise but what about the students? They’re stuck with Computer Science teachers who can’t even code a print statement (true story by the way) just because you put hiring POC over hiring competent teachers. My school district — and one of its schools — are ranked amongst the top schools in California and also in the nation. But the thing that makes it great isn’t the teachers anymore, rather it’s the students. Replace all the students with students from, oh I don’t know, rural Arkansas and you get a school that would be rated the same as it would be in rural Arkansas. Therein lies the problem: it’s not the teachers making it great anymore, it’s the students. Hard working children, particularly from immigrant families are what make the backbone of my school district, and the staff don’t do much to help that. The American education system needs to be rid of this diversity virtue signaling crap, right now. Or else, the the color of your teachers skin will take precedence over your child’s education.

The best ways to invest] [URL: https://thefinancialtalkss.blogspot.com/2023/07/how-to-set-financial-goals-that-will.html] money depend on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some popular and effective ways to invest money: Stock Market: Investing in individual stocks or equity-based mutual funds provides an opportunity for long-term capital appreciation. The stock market offers ownership in companies, allowing you to benefit from their growth and success. Bonds: Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or corporations. They offer regular interest payments and are considered lower risk compared to stocks. Bonds can provide stable income and act as a counterbalance to equity investments.[LINKED_TEXT: Mutual Funds] [URL: https://amzn.to/3XUPD3c]: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. They offer professional management and diversification, making them suitable for various risk profiles.Real Estate: Investing in real estate can generate rental income and potential capital appreciation. Real estate offers a tangible asset that can act as a hedge against inflation and diversify your investment portfolio.Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): ETFs are similar to mutual funds but trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks. They offer diversification, liquidity, and flexibility for investors.Retirement Accounts : Contributing to retirement accounts provides tax advantages and helps you build a nest egg for retirement. Many employers offer matching contributions, making it an even more attractive option.Certificate of Deposit (CD): CDs are time deposits with fixed interest rates and maturity periods. They are low-risk investments suitable for short-term financial goals.High-Yield Savings Accounts: High-yield savings accounts offer better interest rates than traditional savings accounts, helping you grow your emergency fund and savings with minimal risk.Peer-to-Peer Lending: Peer-to-peer lending platforms allow individuals to lend money directly to borrowers, earning interest in return. It can be an alternative source of passive income. The best investment strategy is often a combination of these options based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Diversification across different asset classes and regular review of your portfolio are key to managing risk and optimizing returns. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor an investment plan that aligns with your specific financial aspirations and needs."},{"prompt":"What is the best defence against ransomware?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: {{MetaTitle}}Download K7's award-winning antivirus software & internet security solution that offers advanced virus protection for your PC's, laptops & mobiles.https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100884654-15442354] [URL: https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100884654-15442354]"},{"prompt":"investing in cryptocurrency still profitable?","completion":"Crypto investment has become an increasingly popular option for individuals looking to diversify their portfolios and potentially profit from the volatile and highly speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. There are several key advantages that make crypto investment an attractive option, including: Decentralization - Unlike traditional investments, cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized platform, meaning that there is no central authority controlling the market. This decentralization allows for greater transparency and less chance of manipulation.Potential for High Returns - The highly speculative and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies means that there is the potential for high returns in a short amount of time. This potential for high returns is particularly attractive for those looking to make a quick profit.Diversification - By investing in cryptocurrencies, individuals can diversify their investment portfolios, potentially reducing the overall risk of their investments. This diversification is especially important in a world where traditional markets are becoming increasingly correlated.Accessibility - The widespread adoption of technology and the increasing number of platforms that allow individuals to invest in cryptocurrencies have made crypto investment more accessible than ever before. This accessibility has made it easier for people to get involved in crypto investment, regardless of their prior experience or level of knowledge.Innovation - Cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems and bring about new innovations in the way that we store, transfer and manage our wealth. By investing in cryptocurrencies, individuals have the opportunity to support and benefit from this innovation. However, it's important to note that crypto investment also comes with significant risks, as the crypto market is still largely unregulated and highly speculative. Furthermore, the potential for high returns is also accompanied by the potential for significant losses. It's crucial to understand the risks involved and to educate oneself before investing in cryptocurrencies. In conclusion, the best sides of crypto investment are the decentralization, potential for high returns, diversification, accessibility, and innovation. However, it's important to approach crypto investment with caution and to educate oneself before investing in order to minimize the potential risks involved.

It sounds like a no-brainer. And it used to be a no-brainer... because college used to cost a reasonable amount of money. As recently as 1980, you could get a four-year bachelor’s degree at a public school for less than 10,000, on average. These days it’ll cost you at least 40,000… or upward of 140,000 for a private school... or well over 250,000 for a top school. Unless a kid has rich parents or a full ride scholarship, he must borrow a ton of money to pay for the privilege of attending college. Education Costs… and Student Debt… Are Skyrocketing A few weeks ago, [LINKED_TEXT: I wrote about how America’s broken healthcare industry was bankrupting families] [URL: http://www.riskhedge.com/go/v3c7mf/QOR]. Well, the cost of college has jumped WAY more than the cost healthcare. The cost of a four-year degree has shot up 15X in the past 40 years, as you can see here: If car prices jumped as much as tuition, a base model Toyota Corolla would cost 90,000 today. As costs have zoomed higher, kids are burying themselves under bigger and bigger piles of debt. Student loan balances have snowballed over 400% in the past 15 years. Last month, they hit 1.5 trillion: If student debt were a stock, every Wall Street analyst would be screaming “bubble.” And get this… Americans now owe more for student debt than they owe for credit cards and auto loans... combined! In fact, the average kid takes out 35,000 in debt… a 75% jump in 10 years. That’s a deep hole to dig out of before you’re legally allowed to drink beer. And student loans are the only type of debt you can’t escape, no matter what. Declaring bankruptcy can wipe away your mortgage, your credit card debt, and even stop IRS wage garnishments. But it won’t take a penny off your student loans. Turn 65 and haven’t paid off your student loans? They’ll raid your Social Security check each month. What Do Healthcare and College Have in Common? The government’s dirty fingerprints are all over both. As you may know, the Federal government practically owns the student loan market. More than 94% of all student loans come directly from the US government. And the small 6% slice that doesn’t come from the government is still fully guaranteed by the government. If you’ve applied for a mortgage lately, you know it’s a painful process. You fill out stacks of paperwork, pay steep fees, and hand over a full accounting of your family’s finances. But thanks to Uncle Sam, trillions of dollars in student loans get handed out to 17-year-old kids like candy on Halloween. This free money has warped the whole system and pushed college costs far beyond all reason. Think about it this way: When banks were handing out no-money-down mortgages in the early 2000s to anyone with a pulse, what happened to house prices? They SOARED. Well, colleges know Uncle Sam is bankrolling students, so they hike fees year after year. A recent New York Fed study found for every new dollar of federal student aid, colleges hike tuition by 65 cents. College Is America’s Most “Undisruptable” Industry I wish I could tell you the whole college system is about to get sledgehammered by disruption… But unfortunately, college has been America’s most “undisruptible” industry, [LINKED_TEXT: unlike other industries I recently covered] [URL: http://www.riskhedge.com/go/v3c7mj/QOR]. The vast majority of high school grads still go to college. Once hailed as potential disruptors, for-profit colleges haven’t made a dent. You’ve probably seen commercials for The University of Phoenix. It grew rapidly into one of the biggest and most famous for-profit colleges in the US. But enrollment has plunged lately. And the stock of its parent company Apollo Education Group (APOL) crashed 80% Other for-profit educators like Corinthian Colleges and Indiana’s ITT Tech went bankrupt a few years back and their stocks were “de-listed.” Despite the crazy cost, college is still worth it for many folks today. If you want to be a professional, like an architect, a lawyer, or a CPA, you pretty much have to go to college. On the other hand, if you plan to study archaeology or interpretive dance, college is almost definitely not worth it. There Are Promising Signs That College Is Changing... Have you heard of Coursera? It’s a website where students can enroll in courses from many of the world’s top colleges—like Stanford, Yale, and Princeton. Want to learn how financial markets work from an Ivy League school like Yale? You can enroll for just 50 bucks/month. In the past few years, over 40 million Americans took an online course. I’ve taken classes on public speaking from online learning platform Udemy. They cost ten bucks each and were excellent. The world’s fourth-largest company Google (GOOG) now offers professional certificates on Coursera. You can get a “cloud computing” certificate in two months. Google has given financial aid to 10,000 students taking the course. Here’s My Prediction for How the Disruption Will Play Out It’s only a matter of time before Coursera and other online disruptors start offering real college degree courses. What happens when you can get a bona fide online college degree—one that confers the exact same benefits of an in-person college degree—for a couple of thousand dollars? The number of kids going to traditional college will crater. And schools will be forced to slash their tuition costs. Many top American colleges are already making this shift. You can get a degree from Ivy League school University of Pennsylvania over the internet now. The best part? Online tuition costs roughly half what you’d pay versus sitting in a lecture hall... even though the course material is identical. Look, we’re barely in the first inning of disrupting education. Who knows, maybe in a few years the likes of Google and Amazon will open up their own colleges. You’ll get trained by Google for free. And when you finish, Google will charge companies to recruit you. We Must Always Ask, “What Will the World Look like in Five Years?” Early signs are mounting that some traditional colleges are in trouble. After rising every decade since 1890… the number of US colleges has fallen over the past 10 years. And the number of kids going to college has declined for seven consecutive years. Top schools like Yale, Harvard, and Stanford will always attract elite kids and command huge tuitions. But online disruptors could put many of the 4,000 “middle-of-the-road” US colleges out of business.

Because of that having right employee is one of most important thing in the organization. Since selection is the process of choosing the individual best suited for a particular position and the organization, selection is playing an important role in organizational level. Having right representative depends on the basic leadership in the contracting. Procuring a representative depends on the choice of a perfect individual. If the organizational manages or selectors select an individual who do not match with the job, then it will cost to the organization. Watch Now - Why selection is more important? On the off chance that the chose individual is over qualified or under qualified, the work turnover will take higher number in the association, in light of the fact that, if the individual is under qualified, at that point she will not be able to do the job as expected by his/her managers. Hence, the productivity will fall in the organizational level. It may result to fail the organization in the long run.On the off chance that the association chooses a group of people, not suit to their necessity, at that point they may bomb even in the short run. On the off chance that the association chooses the over qualified individual, it may not help to the person to use his/her ability for the association. In both scenarios, the employees will get frustrate soon and will leave the organization or managers may fire them, before they leave. It will cause to the higher LTO (Labor Turn Over) Selected individuals should fit with the organizational culture, environment, and organizational goals. Those things are key factors to make the success of the organization in the future. If selected individual is not matching with the culture, norms, beliefs, goals, and the environment, both managers and employees will fed-up with working. Choosing a wrong individual will cost by requiring additionally preparing period, (for under qualified people they may require all the more preparing to land comfortable with the position, for over qualified people, they may not focus on the culture and other norms and environment. So over qualified individuals will work out of the process. Both situations will make the job harder and will create to do work more than twice. Additionally, after the worker left the association or after they got let go, administrators may need to experience again with the entire enrollment process. It will time consuming and will consume more money and by that it will make more cost. Likewise, after the worker left the association or after they got let go, chiefs may need to experience again with the entire enlistment process.

Where do I start from educating myself on other options of investment? I feel dumb when friends around me talk about stock trading.","completion":"So I’m going to give you some answers, but I feel it would be a disservice to you, to not warn you of the dangers. Don’t assume that your friends really know as much as they indicate with their chatter. I’ve met a lot of people who think they know what they are doing, and they didn’t, and they lost their money. That said, if you want to be a professional investor, then I would go all in. I have no idea what your career aspirations are, but for those who want to be professional stock traders, you need to get a degree in finance, and one good way to do that is to get an internship at a big company that will help pay your tuition. Get the internship, and the degree (hopefully with tuition reimbursement from your employer). Then you get a license to sell assets and commodities and such, and become a professional trader. Now as for your friends, statistically speaking, last I checked 80% of day-traders lost their money. What is a ‘day-trader’? Well simply put, a day-trader is a non-professional stock trader. These are people on WeBull, or AmeriTrade, or Robinhood, or any number of other cell phone apps that let you buy stocks. People think they can be professional traders, just by tapping on a smart phone app. The reality is, if it was that easy, the everyone on the planet would be doing that and making millions. But they don’t. Why? Because you can’t. Not really. I worked at a financial institution. Let me tell you what real stock trading is, as best I’ve seen it with my own eyes. We had a glass sound insulated room, with computers, and TVs everywhere. Every major TV news channel was on 24/7. Every major news paper and financial paper, was on the tables before the traders arrived in the morning. We had ‘bloomberg terminals’. 24,000 per year PER TERMINAL, to lease these terminals. They can have up to six displays, and a ridiculous number of pages of data on each stock. The room also had an electronic ticker that ran 24/7, with the prices of each and every stock the firm had purchased, scrolling around the room non-stop. Now the question is why? Why did they have all this? Because the stock traders, to do their job effectively, must eat, breath, drink stock information non-stop. They have to know everything that is going on. In order to make money, you need to know if China lunches an attack on Taiwan, and the company you invested in, has all their chip manufacturing in Taiwan. You need to know if X.corp just got slapped with an investigation by the Europe Union over some regulation. You need to know if the latest car GM put out, caught fire on the show room, and no one wants to buy it. You need to know these things, and you need to find out as soon as you possibly can, because if you show up an hour late, the stock prices drop, and now you lost your money. This is why most day-traders lose their money. They think they can tap on their cell phone a few times, and then go play video games, or hang out with the guys, and the money will magically roll in. It doesn’t. This is why I personally invest in mutual funds. Mutual funds are funds that exist with a specific investment philosophy, and they hire the professional traders, that invest our money, on our behalf. So while you don’t have time to sit there investigating companies to invest in, you instead give your money to a mutual fund that hires the people who do have the time, because it’s their professional job to investigate companies, and pick who to invest in. How do you pick a mutual fund? Well I follow 3 simple rules. Never invest into a fund that is less than 10 years old. New experimental funds are for billionaires that have millions to burn on a risky new investment.Also invest into multiple funds, for me, a domestic fund, an international fund, and a general fund. So a fund that invests mostly in America. One that invests in Europe and Asia typically. And then maybe an emerging market fund, or growth fund.Never invest into any mutual fund that has a life-time or 10-year ROI that is below 10%. Getting a 10% return or better, is not hard. Many mutual funds have that. And there is one extra rule: Do not sell your stocks, when the market is down. This is the dumbest thing people do. Their stocks go down, and they pull their money out. That’s idiotic. When stock prices are low, that’s when you buy. Warren Buffet said famously, in order to make money you have to buy low, and sell high. And the first step is, buy low. People do the dumbest things, and sell their stocks when the price is low, and then buy stocks when the price is high. Don’t do that. You really can’t lose money in your 401k or IRA, unless you screw with it. If you lost money, it’s because you screwed with it. Never cash out your 401k, unless you are of retirement age. If you cash out early, with taxes and penalties, you’ll lose a huge portion of your money. If you leave it alone, it will grow. If you invest just 100 a month, from age 20 to 67, into a mutual fund that averages 10% ROI per year, by age 67, you’ll have 1.3 Million dollars or close to it. That’s assuming you never invest more than 100. That you never get a company match on your 401k. And that your mutual fund never does significantly better than 10%. I have mutual funds that average 14% over the life time of the fund. By the way, if your mutual fund only averages 7% ROI, then you’ll retire with 400,000 instead of 1.3 Million. It may not seem like a big deal to get a little lower ROI, but even just 3% less, makes a huge difference. And of course, you should be saving 500 a month in your mutual funds, or 20% of your gross income. Now if you are still insistent on buying individual stocks, then you should do what this guy did. [LINKED_TEXT: A janitor secretly amassed an 8 million fortune and left most of it to his library and hospitalA one-time janitor and gas station attendant demonstrated that you can become a multimillionaire with a modest salary.https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/29/janitor-secretly-amassed-an-8-million-fortune.html] [URL: https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/29/janitor-secretly-amassed-an-8-million-fortune.html]So this guy just bought stocks. His investment plan was really simple. He purchased stocks in household name companies, that he personally understood. So he was buying stocks in Ford, and Walmart, and Microsoft. Just buying as many as he could every month, and owning them. Over his lifetime, he ended up with 8 Million dollars, just in stocks he purchased, as a janitor. Again, I would advise you not to do the day-trader thing, and think you can buy and sell stocks like a professional stock traders. You likely can’t. Most day traders lose their money. You must eat, drink, breath, live stock information to really make money at it. So if you want to be a stock trader, be a professional one, and make a career out of it. If you still bound and determined to do this, I would recommend books by Warren Buffet. Warren Buffet figured out, that you don’t invest in stocks. That’s a bad plan. What you do, is you invest in companies. So you figure out what the company does, what they are making, and what they hope to achieve, and figure out if that makes sense to the market. And when he learned this, he stopped just picking stocks, and instead investing in companies. The good news here is that most of his books are relatively cheap. “The Warren Buffet Way”, is on youtube as an audiobook, but I would warn you that it’s not a professional reading it. It’s the PDF of the book, being read by a computer ‘text-to-speach’, and it sounds robotic, and is somewhat annoying. But that is of course free to listen to on youtube.

Later, Bipasha cleared the facts stating, “Yes, it is me in the picture, it was taken at an opportune moment…it looks like a case of irresponsible assumptions.” She added, “He is so cute and it was strange when he called me cute … He is a friend now and he has promised me that I will be invited to all his matches. I was surprised when he told me that his mum watches old Hindi film movies.” 2. Controversial Photoshoot with Ameesha Patel Bipasha Basu was seen getting cozy with actress Ameesha Patel in the magazine cover photoshoot. People slammed the magazine for Bipasha’s inappropriate pose with Ameesha Patel in the photo. For the record, it was one of the best-selling issues of that magazine. 3. Catfight with Kareena Kapoor Khan Bipasha Basu is a model turned actress and she has had a fair share of struggle before getting a movie offer from Bollywood. In her debut movie Ajnabee, she was seen opposite Akshay Kumar. The movie was a multi-starrer with an ensemble cast of Bobby Deol, Kareena Kapoor Khan, and Akshay Kumar. During the shooting, Bipasha was involved in a fight with Kareena Kapoor Khan and Kareena also made some racist comments on Bipasha’s skin. The fight became ugly and actresses didn’t talk to each other for years. 4. Lingerie ad shoot with Dino Moria After the success of the horror movie Raaz, the star of the movie Dino Moria and Bipasha Basu started dating each other. The duo got an ad together for the famous lingerie brand. As expected, the ad shoot was sensational and appealing. However, some people protested and filed a lawsuit to ban the ad due to its obscene content. Later, the actress apologized for it and confessed that the shot was not meant to be included in the ad as per the script. It was the couple playing around which was used in the ad video clip. 5. Call Controversies with Politician Amar Singh In a leaked call record of politician Amar Singh, he can be heard doing a dirty talk with actress Bipasha Basu. The tape went viral which affected the sensational career of the actress as well. However, both Bipasha and Amar Singh came forward and clarified it. While Bipasha clearly denies having any conversation with Amar Singh on phone, but Amar Singh accepted that it was him on the other side of the phone but he wasn’t talking to Bipasha Basu at all. Bipasha Basu said, “The voice in the recording is certainly not mine. I dare say that my voice has distinct characteristics and the voice on the tape is completely different. Nothing could be farther from the truth.” 6. Ugly Breakup with John Abraham Bipasha Basu is also in news headlines for her affairs in the industry. She was in a relationship with model-actor John Abraham for almost 9 years. The famous couple split up and while John said it was a mutual breakup, Bipasha Basu is not agreeing with him even on this. Bipasha said, “Though no break-up is a good break-up, time heals everything, including broken friendships… But cheating, infidelity, and deceit are generally tough to forgive, and in those cases, real friendship is not possible.” She added, “It was very much possible to be friends with your ex if he wasn’t an assh*le.” 7. Child Labor Controversies Bipasha shared a photo in which two kids were seen tying her shoelaces. The pic went viral for all the wrong reasons and embroiled in a sensational controversy. Bipasha Basu was accused of indulging in a child labor crime. However, the actress refused all these allegations and said that the girls in the picture were her sister and a friend.

That's all. If I'm Hindu, I will observe Holi, dussehara, Diwali, Ram-navami etc. If I'm a Muslim, I will observe Roja, Eid, Ramzan etc, similarly its applicable for other religions. If I believe in secularism, then I may not observe Eid, but I will be happy on Eid, I will wish my Muslim friends & brothers Happy Eid or happy Ramzan Bhai.

I assume the question is about dwelling units, so I will answer for them. Short Answer The NEC (National Electrical Code) requires receptacles be GFCI-protected in many locations beyond just kitchens and bathrooms. More information on that below. If one wants, one can exceed the NEC requirements and GFCI-protect all receptacles (with one very small exception that rarely applies to dwelling units - noted below). There is little reason to ever install GFCI receptacles at each and every receptacle outlet just to GFCI-protect the circuit. There are other cost-effective and from a safety standpoint better ways of doing that (details below). Details below for those interested. If not interested, you certainly may stop reading here. You won’t hurt my feelings. A Technical Detail Technically what you are talking about is referred to as a “receptacle” - more specifically a duplex GFCI receptacle. The receptacle is mounted in a receptacle outlet. Many people call receptacles outlets, which is fine with me. I just want you to know the proper technical terms. The Question Rephrased I will rephrase the question - to make it easier for me to address in a logical sequence. “I want to GFCI-protect all (or multiple) outlets (receptacle outlets) - how do I do that?” There are a couple of ways that this is done: Use a GFCI receptacle as the first receptacle in the string of receptacles on that circuit.Install a GFCI circuit breaker. Let’s look at how that is done and look at some pro’s and con’s for each method. GFCI Receptacle First In the Circuit The diagram below shows generically how this is done. The GFCI protects all downstream receptacles if wired this way. Exact wiring for this is given in the instructions supplied with the GFCI receptacle. Pro’s: Inexpensive (compared to GFCI circuit breaker). Con’s: If that GFCI receptacle is located in a hard to get to location, a GCFI circuit breaker might be a better option.But the NEC requires the GFCI protection to be located in a “readily accessable location” - which means a location “capable of being reached quickly for operation, renewal, or inspections without requiring those to whom ready access is required to take actions such as to use tools (other than keys), to climb over or under, or to remove obstacles, or to resort to portable ladders and so forth.” If tripped, one may need to look around to locate where the tripped GFCI receptacle is located at. GFCI Circuit Breaker A GFCI circuit breaker is installed in the circuit breaker panel, and protects all the receptacles on the circuit wired to that circuit breaker. Pro’s: Now you know where the GFCI TRIP/RESET button is - in the circuit breaker box. No need to look everywhere to find it. Cons: More expensive (than a GFCI receptacle).Need to go to the location of the circuit breaker box to locate and reset the GFCI.Personally I don’t believe the typical Quora-reading homeowner should be opening up their circuit breaker box and doing this installation. I do not believe that is safe for them to do. And in some jurisdictions legally they may not be allowed to do this, or it may require an electrical permit. Where Does the NEC Require GFCI-Protection? I will reference the latest NEC (National Electrical Code) - the 2023 NEC. For sure your area follows an earlier edition, but I don’t want to take the time to reference the multitude of editions that are currently being enforced throughout the US. For those who follow the NEC, it is apparent that those involved in developing this code believe in GFCI protection (as do I). In every edition (the NEC is revised every three years) the requirements for GFCI-protection increases. For those who want to see all the details, sign up for free access to the NEC at the NFPA web site. The 2023 and earlier editions are there for you to access.

There are some exceptions to these requirements, which I won’t get into here because they are fairly detailed. You can read them on your own in the NEC. There are also requirements that some specific appliances be GFCI-protected [reference 2023 NEC 210.8(D)]. The ones most applicable to dwelling units are: Sump pumpsDishwashersElectric rangesWall-mounted ovensCounter-mounted cooking unitsClothes dryersMicrowave ovens Note that these requirements are for circuits of 60 amps or less, 150 volts to ground or less. In the US, the common 240 volt circuit is 120 volts to ground, so 240 volt circuits are included in the above. Are There Any Places Where the NEC Does NOT ALLOW GFCI-protection? (Dwelling Units) The NEC does not require GFCI-protection everywhere, but there is only one place where the NEC specifically does not allow GFCI-protection: “The branch circuit supply (for power-limited fire alarm circuits) shall not be supplied through ground-fault circuit interrupters or arc-fault circuit interrupters.” [Reference 2023 NEC 760.121(B)(2)]. Other NEC Receptacle Requirements In addition to GFCI-protection requirements, the NEC has other requirements for receptacles, depending on where they are located, including: Use of tamper-resistant receptacles (TR) in many locationsUse of weather-resistant (WR) receptacles in certain locations (and appropriately-listed covers)AFCI (arc fault circuit interrupter) protection for many circuits Existing Installations Do I need to do all of this for my existing installation? No, the NEC as with many codes contains what is called a “grandfather clause.” This is at 2023 NEC 80.9(B) and (C). Another Possible Question Is there any situation where it would be desired to have each and every receptacle be a GFCI receptacle rather that simply having the circuit GFCI-protected? I can’t imagine anyone doing this in a dwelling unit (because of cost) but I have done this in industrial facilities. This is in an area where GFCI-protection is desired or required, but the concern is that if the GFCI trips it is important to be able to locate it quickly. In those cases duplex GFCI receptacles were installed at each outlet, each fed directly from the circuit wiring (not from another GFCI).

The reason why scientists are more concerned about the impact of CO2 in the atmosphere than water vapor, is because Governments around the world are not able, just at the moment, to tax water. They are however, able to tax the air you breath out. Here is my electricity bill: This is our monthly electricity bill and as you can see, the discreetly named ‘Government and regulatory levies’ (Carbon Credits) plus the ‘Climate Change Levy’, come to £2,964.46 per month. The Government and Regulatory Levies and the Climate Change Levy together come to nearly £3000 per month. Multiply this by all the businesses in the world and you can see why this absolutely colossal amount of money collected by all governments every month, is not going to be relinquished just because little people like me think it’s a dishonest tax which swindles money from the ordinary citizen because they know industrial levies like this get passed on to the consumer. I estimate, (probably wrong) that that all the various climate tax revenues around the world add up to about 4 billion a month - more than enough to pay the salaries of research climatologist, low-carbon Innovation Strategists, Universty climate departments and all other support agencies eager to endorse the new tax."},{"prompt":"What is onpage SEO?","completion":"On-page SEO refers to the optimization techniques used to improve the visibility and ranking of a web page within search engine results pages (SERPs).

You have a few options; if you are in a month to month rental you can find another place and give notice to vacate. If you are in a lease that still has time to complete you can pay the fee for breaking the lease and vacate. The most common reason a landlord will not remove someone from a rental agreement or lease is concern regarding payment of rent and or damages. In addition, removing someone from a lease/rental agreement is basically starting a new contract which requires that the landlord does a property inspection and a final accounting which would require that any deposit be refunded after any damages are deducted. Then write a new lease and collect deposits, fees, change locks, etc. This would also allow for an immediate rent increase so you may actually be better off to leave it as is."},{"prompt":"f Taiwan had fallen to CCP in 1949, what cultural artifacts would have been destroyed during the Cultural Revolution?","completion":"Thanks Kang for asking this question. It’s hard to say what would have happened if the CCP won and actually made it to Taiwan; however, based on what we know when the KMT came, after the 228 incident and the beginning of the White Terror, many Taiwanese that were in danger fled to Japan. I think this would have happened in larger numbers if the CCP came too. The military government that governed Taiwan was definitely very anti-communist and it was probably one of the reasons why they surrendered to the US. Even marxist supporters who were being purged during the White Terror ended up in Japan. Although there were marxists in Taiwan, many of these marxists still imagined an independent Taiwan rather than being part of mainland China at the time. Mao himself had indicated that he was for Taiwanese independence. I would have imagine many of them using their connections from the colonial period leaving to protect their assets as well as escaping because they feared of being persecuted for working for the Colonial government. Knowing Mao’s policies after he won the civil war, I think many Taiwanese would have become very disillusioned quickly. I think the majority of Taiwanese people would have had a “wait and see” attitude as they did when the Nationalists arrived. Unfortunately for them, they would have been seriously disappointed since many Taiwanese were disappointed when they saw Nationalist soldiers arrive. I think they would have been even more disappointed with seeing PLA soldiers. By the time the Cultural Revolution hit, you would have had a fairly large diaspora of Taiwanese in places like Japan or even the Philippines. I don’t think the cultural revolution would have been as successful in Taiwan because remember, during the colonial period living standards were quite good. It’s really hard to go from a fairly developed society to one where everyone had to work in collectively as agriculturalists. I think most likely many Taiwanese would have done what they could to salvage religious artifacts and probably smuggle them to Japan or the Philippines. Everything else that were privately owned would have been hidden or for those who could escape, would have tried to take whatever they could with them when they left for Japan or the Philippines. For the marxists that existed in Taiwan, many of them were more so influenced by a marxist ideology from Japan not really from ..."},{"prompt":"Are antiabortion laws Godly?","completion":"Depends on which God your refering.

This man had single-handedly charted BJP's electoral downfall in the 2004 Lok Sabha Elections. Remember, that Atalji interview. That incident of free distribution in Lucknow where women died in the ensuing stampede. This man really blew them off-limits. But yesterday he was at irrefutable pains. YOGI juggernaut couldn't be stopped. And yes it demolishes the ‘ Lal Topi' without any underlying religious fervour. Rajdeep was obviously at discomforts. His words didn't contain that much flow. Again, the veteran journalist - secular in his beliefs- couldn't understand- why the BJP is set to romp back home despite no Hindu backlash as the Saffron outfit always got associated whenever it won an Election. This Assembly Election is bound to throw surprising results- at least for the Secular mindset. If Kejriwal wins on freebies- Nitish wins on Social Security and Mamata romps home on Welfare schemes- then what crime Yogi Adityanath has committed. In his tenure, Muslims got Houses under the Government schemes. They got free Ration and yes, the Roads became transportable and to maintain Law and Order became his Government's topmost priority. Didn't Muslim households feel Yogi's Government shared their concerns and made them equal participants without any bias that gets associated in a Muslim mind whenever he sees an individual attired in Saffron dress? But then Yogi Adityanth is a Monk of the highest order. Steeped in the most basic traditions if Hinduism- and one who cares for all - with no any bias into the religious affiliations of a common resident in Uttar Pradesh. The problem with the ilks of Rajdeep Sardesai is manifold. These types of journalists carry a dubious set of perceptions. First, they aspire that the Muslim community votes on its preconceived notions. The very manner it voted in the pre-partition days. Paving the way for the creation of Pakistan. Today, Rajdeep strongly believes the Indian Muslims to vote against the BJP on the same religious lines. According to Rajdeep, their mind should be guided by their Faith. Freebies and Welfare schemes initiated by the Yogi Government should never be a part of this package. Second, for the Hindu voters- well BJP is scrupulously destroying the Cultural and Social fabric built over the Centuries and is now under tatters. Hindus must learn more. Here Rajdeep agrees indirectly agrees with our ‘Secular' ex-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. ‘Minorities have the preferential rights on our Nation's natural resources.’ So, the Hindus with nowhere to go must live a second grade Citizens in this Nation. And must agree to become vassal to a Muslim mindset after they gain a majority in the succeeding decades - because of their fertility. It became natural for someone like Rajdeep to hide the Muslim threats- within the shadows of Secularism and exaggerate the religious overtures of Hindus. More - when we have the battleground of Uttar Pradesh- riddled with the fastest equations and a section of Hindus saying not ‘Ram' but ‘Krishna' is their God. Irony is that both the Ram and Krishna Temples were destroyed by the Mughals. And yes, Prayagraj was forcibly named as ‘Allahabad' by that Akbar the Great. Much water has since flown in both Ganga and Yamuna. After, seven decades of partition - the wheel has turned. Muslims voting en bloc on religious lines. And openly bursting crackers on Pakistani win over the Indian Cricket Team. And, Hindus, on the other hand, trying to assert themselves and keep immune from the false narratives of the -’Ganga Jamuni' tahzeeb. The reason why Yogi Adityanath is forced to rename Allahabad back to Prayagraj. Muslims and Seculars ( I mean like Rajdeep) first they always undermine Indian History and again they try to falsify the dangers the majority Hindus face. “Aap to sau crore ho, koi aapka kya bigad lega.” You are a hundred crores, who can damage you. And then starts the dangerous part. First, break the Hindu into caste and language and then align the weaker with the Muslim community and lo you have a formidable combination. Something like what Mulayam and Laloo did. Afterwards Kanshiram and Mayavati achieved. And now Tejaswi and Akhilesh aspire to hold on to. Yogi Adityanath however stood better than them all. With no family baggage the Monk settled for his true RAJ DHARMA. AND we have everyone in Uttar Pradesh getting a slice of Development irrespective of his Religion and Caste. Yesterday, Rajdeep pointed, BJP Rallies contained a sizeable number of women spectators. In comparison, the Samajwadi ones wore an abysmal look on this count. Which women will dare to become a part of the Gunda congregation? I'm sure unless provided with suitable Security - Dimple Yadav too won't venture there. This sums up why Rajdeep Sardesai is splitting his journalistic hairs and the Samajwadi and Seculars wait for another couple of days to do the same. 300 plus or not- Rajdeep Sardesai is non-plussed. BJP is winning the UP Assembly Elections without any religious fervour attached to it's winning flavour. But that leaves another question - after two years when Narendra Modi will resume his campaigning and when those casteist equations will evaporate and almost slow down - as we saw in the 2019 Lok Sabha results- what will then happen to the aspirations of this secular brigade which boasts the likes of Rajdeep Sardesai. After 10th March this question will hound them for two more years."},{"prompt":"What are some unique startup ideas for India?","completion":"Real estate, showroom, agency etc"},{"prompt":"Can I do fashion designing after completing polytechnic?","completion":"Yes, you can go for the fashion designing course after completing polytechnic.

He then set up his own firm, Stratton Oakmont, and used a pump and dump scheme where he would buy worthless and cheap stock and use misleading statements that would make people invest. This would inflate the price at which he could sell his own shares at the highest price worth. JB also had people buy small amounts of normal NASDAQ stock to gain trust of the investor and then tell them to take a risk and buy penny stocks which have a 50% commission again. You cannot sell your client worthless stock you own without telling them also. Jordan Belfort also sold non-existent stock. Jordan Belfort’s friend, Danny Porush, grew up with Steve Madden, a women’s shoe company. JB took Steve Madden public but he, Steve and Danny owned large shares in the company which was illegal. JB made Steve Madden sign a paper saying that the stock is his no matter how high the price goes and to put the stock certificate in escrow (safe hands). This meant Steve Madden was part of this stock fraud. This is because Steve Madden was only allowed to be listed on NASDAQ if the underwriter only owned 5% of the stock. But JB etc owned more than 5% so that was illegal. A rathole was someone who owned shares of stock on paper. But you couldn’t own more than 5% of any stock. JB secretly bought large amounts of new issue stock at standard prices JB would set. In the case of Steve Madden, of the 2 million units up for public offer, 1 million were purchased by ratholes at which JB would buy the stock back (for about 1-5M) at the standard initial price or less so that the ratholes made a profit of 1.50 every 1 stock and then JB would artificially increase the price because of the amount of buying and selling this would cause as everyone would ‘pick up the fucking phone and start dialling’. JB then sold all of his own stock at the inflated price to make 20-25 million profit."},{"prompt":"What are your choices of preference in NEET 2022 counseling?","completion":"I secured an AIR of 2143 in NEET 2022.

One of the most significant issues is the lack of equitable access to quality education, with students from marginalized communities often facing barriers to resources and opportunities. This perpetuates systemic inequalities and contributes to the achievement gap between different socioeconomic groups. Additionally, the emphasis on standardized testing has been criticized for promoting rote memorization and teaching to the test, rather than fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This can lead to a narrow focus on test performance rather than broader educational goals, such as creativity, innovation, and citizenship. Furthermore, the current education system often fails to address the diverse needs of students, particularly those with learning disabilities, mental health challenges, or non-traditional learning styles. This can lead to disengagement and frustration, causing some students to drop out or underperform. There are multiple issues with the current education system in the US that need to be addressed to ensure all students receive a high-quality, equitable education.

The man was Jean Monnet, and through declassified archives, we even know how much money he was given. Dulles redacted the founding charter, albeit he had it endorsed by a French collaborationist, who had been alternately German and French, and finally, they had the Nazi jurist whom Hitler had charged of devising such a contraption when the Nazi thought THEY would be ruling over Europe, be the first chairman of the EU Commission.

It involves various techniques and strategies to make your web pages more search engine-friendly, ultimately helping search engines understand the content and context of your pages and rank them higher for relevant search queries. Key components of on-page SEO include: 1. Keyword Optimization: Research and target relevant keywords that users are likely to search for. Incorporate these keywords naturally into your page's content, headings, subheadings, and meta tags. 2. High-Quality Content: Create valuable, informative, and relevant content that addresses the needs and interests of your target audience. High-quality content is more likely to attract backlinks and social shares. 3. Title Tags: Craft unique and descriptive title tags for each page, incorporating the target keyword. Keep titles within the recommended character limit (usually around 60 characters) and make them compelling to encourage clicks. 4. Meta Descriptions: Write compelling meta descriptions that provide a concise summary of the page's content. While meta descriptions don't directly impact rankings, they can influence click-through rates. 5. Headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.): Organize your content using proper heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.). Use the H1 tag for the main title and subsequent headings to structure your content logically. 6. URL Structure: Create clean and descriptive URLs that include relevant keywords and provide users and search engines with an idea of the page's content. 7. Internal Linking: Link to other relevant pages within your website. Internal links help distribute link equity, aid in navigation, and encourage users to explore more of your content. 8. Image Optimization: Optimize images by using descriptive file names and alt text. This not only helps with accessibility but also provides search engines with context about the images. 9. Mobile-Friendly Design: Ensure your web pages are responsive and display correctly on various devices, including smartphones and tablets. 10. Page Speed: Improve page loading times by optimizing images, minimizing code, and leveraging browser caching. Faster-loading pages provide a better user experience and can positively affect rankings. 11. Schema Markup: Implement schema markup to provide additional context to search engines about the type of content on your page, which can result in enhanced search result listings (rich snippets). 12. User Experience (UX): Prioritize user experience by making your pages easy to navigate, visually appealing, and user-friendly. A positive UX can lead to longer dwell times and lower bounce rates, which can indirectly impact SEO. 13. Social Sharing: Make it easy for users to share your content on social media platforms by including social sharing buttons. Remember that on-page SEO is just one aspect of a comprehensive SEO strategy. It works in conjunction with other elements, such as off-page SEO (building backlinks from external sources), technical SEO (optimizing website structure and performance), and user experience optimization, to improve your website's overall search engine visibility and rankings.

David McCullough's thoroughly researched book (and the exceptional mini-series based upon it) explained well Adams' contribution to the Revolution and the years immediately following, both on the national scene and on the local and colonial (he penned the Massachusetts State Constitution) stages. It may be that, because he was our first vice-president and second president (not the first president), he seems to pale in comparison to Washington or Jefferson, or even Madison. Another reason Adams may seem underrated is because he was often caught in the middle between Alexander Hamilton, a staunch Federalist, and Washington, who embodied the ideals of a republican government and both preceded and eschewed political parties. As president, Adams fought and often lost to more radical elements of his own party, which made him look weak. He regularly drew fire from Jefferson's Republicans, as well, and found himself with few true allies, even among his presidential cabinet. Adams personality and character often opened him to criticism from other politicians and the press. His ability to lock heels in the wrong arguments (as in his proposed title for the president: \\"His Highness, Protector of Their Liberties \\") compelled opponents to tease him and treat him with disdain. He was intelligent, self-made, opinionated, independent, and a Yankee; he was not wealthy, and not a part of Virginia's ruling elite, and therefore was considered somewhat an outsider. While he deserves credit as one of the most brilliant minds of the Founding Fathers, and deserves credit for opening international relations during the American Revolution, he was not without scandal or controversy, especially as president.

All this, though, is found in several recently published books about John Adams and his times, which means to me that his story is being told. He seems to rank highly among the Founding Fathers. In spite of himself, he is not underrated. Edit: John Heim rightly points out that there are no monuments of Adams in Washington DC, which seems to have monuments to everyone. I agree. Here's my response pasted here: Yes, that's a very good point. He also shares the only federal monument (of which I am aware) that bears his name: The Adams National Historic Park, which he shares with his son, John Quincy Adams (and other descendants of note). The fact that he has but the one memorial, to me, speaks more to opinions of him in the first hundred years of our republic than in the last one hundred plus years. The Adams Family occupied the site until the 1920s. Not long after that, efforts began to preserve it. I know of no efforts prior to that to dedicate a memorial to the man. I think Adams is more appreciated in the 20th and 21st Century than he ever was in the 19th Century."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?","completion":"The two mostly used frameworks namely Angular and AngularJS are in tough competition on which one is better to use.

I’ll try to address why such claims throng the internet. In order to understand the caste blind minors, you need to understand their shaping followed by the perception. What is the social context in the first place? The trend that we see often skips this vital part. Let’s take the largest state in the country for instance, where upper castes (UCs) make up approximately 20% of the population. Aggarwal A, Drèze J, Gupta A (2015) Caste and the power elite in Allahabad. Economic and Political Weekly, 45-51. It is apparent how traditional Hindu order is maintained in jobs from the above table. Upper castes encashed their caste capital post-independence and more readily post-liberalization. The result is the skew in the capitalist class derived from the Hindu caste system. Deshpande A, Ramachandran R (2019). Traditional hierarchies and affirmative action in a globalizing economy: Evidence from India. World Development, 118, 63-78. Let’s take a deeper look at positions of power and influence in a well populated city like Prayagraj (previously Allahabad) as of 2012. Aggarwal A, Drèze J, Gupta A (2015) Caste and the power elite in Allahabad. Economic and Political Weekly, 45-51. I can post several such data points (see other answers in bio if interested), but you get the gist . When you put things in context, you realize that anti-reservation warriors are not exactly anti-caste, they assume caste blindness. And what happens when you are blind at the time of injustice? You are okay with conserving the status quo, where a few castes retain top positions. A well upvoted answer here claims that reservations provoke UC school students due to caste columns in application forms, thereby creating hitherto unknown caste consciousnesses, and this perpetuates the caste divide. You see, here the burden of caste is inverted. It doesn’t matter in such climate of ignorance if your surname is a dead giveaway to caste, or whether low caste students are adequately represented in schools in the first place. What matters is UC school kids with little social sense and knowledge in policy getting reminded of caste! I wonder why twice-born kids are not burdened by their ceremonies that remind them of their holy caste. Anyway, reservation attacks are a tool to retain cultural specifics like merit, let alone talking about debarring non-vegetarian food from hostel mess. The latter does not enrage your typical woke, and rightly so. It is conservation of cultural capital of course. It doesn’t matter if 44% of Dalits are denied housing in NCR. Thorat S, Banerjee A, Mishra V K, Rizvi F (2015) Urban rental housing market. Economic & Political Weekly, 27, 47-53. The resulting ghettoization even for well educated Dalits who migrate for jobs is not a problem. But yes, a fucking application form is. Now, most of the anti-reservation crusaders among the anglophone class might not harbor explicit prejudice. But this complex is constructed from a young age using terms like merit and so on. The general view in these circles is that their opportunities are being snatched by lower castes. To push my point further on cultural capital, there are still many who do not know that EWS reservation is for UCs. Not many memes about that from anti-reservation crusaders either. Most researchers who publish important data in the subject from academia are UCs (mostly liberal-leftist), because they are as a group again, well represented disproportionately in top institutes. They make no qualms in admitting that low castes are underrepresented (despite reservations and other schemes) and lag behind in several indices. Gender inequality cannot be erased by forgetting or not analyzing gender dynamics. It requires policies cemented on gender factors. Similarly, caste inequality cannot be erased by acting like it doesn’t exist. Caste is not just an ancient ritual system or tradition. It is a dynamic aspect of the Indian economy. Caste is a good predictor of stunting, household location and income levels apart from the obvious things like dietary habits and caste surnames. Simply, caste reservations ensure that India does not cut a sorry figure when it comes to caste inequality. Casteism is kept alive typically by those groups who score higher in the caste hierarchy. It is easy to understand why claims against reservation are rampant from the same groups."},{"prompt":"Can somebody help me with the best endocrinologist in Mumbai for pcos?","completion":"PCOS is an endocrine and metabolic disorder.

We left in October which means that all the major hotels were closed for the season. By coincidence, on our first night out from Fairbanks we stayed at the same “hotel” that we stayed at on our last night before we arrived there three years earlier. It looked like they had taken the bedroom and bathroom portions of several mobile homes and welded them together, then they slapped a wooden walkway across the front and called it a hotel. The TV got nothing except one channel, a very snowy CBC. Well, it was western Canada, after all. No, that was not the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at, just setting the stage. So we continue driving through western Canada and finally arrive in Sheridan, Wyoming, and lo, in the distance, shining like a beacon, stands a Holiday Inn. We walked into the lobby and I literally remember gawking like Howard Carter after he opened King Tut’s tomb.

If Superman flicked a human being with his finger with sufficient energy to knock them out or push them a meter or more away, it would rip through skin and bone like tissue paper. It wouldn’t knock them out, and it wouldn’t send them hurtling through the air as so many of the comics show. It would just kill them. Their skulls would explode and they would drop to the ground, dead. In the real world, physics doesn’t work the way it does in the comics. The energy in a heavy weight boxer’s punch sufficient for a KO is about 1,600 joules per this source. That’s the kinetic energy, but it’s spread over a 10-oz glove with padding that absorbs some of the impact. It’s a very large surface area which has a lot of give compared to Superman’s finger. Superman’s finger is effectively an undeformable pebble, closer to a steel-jacketed bullet than anything else. A 180-grain (12 g) bullet fired from .357 magnum handgun can achieve a muzzle energy of 580 foot-pounds force (790 J). A 110-grain (7.1 g) bullet fired from the same gun might only achieve 400 foot-pounds force (540 J) of muzzle energy, depending upon the manufacture of the cartridge. Some .45 Colt ammunition can produce 1,200 foot-pounds force (1,600 J) of muzzle energy, far in excess of the average listed above. [LINKED_TEXT: Muzzle energy - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy] Yeah, a .357 magnum handgun produces half the energy of a heavy weight boxer’s punch, but it’s all concentrated in a much smaller area. That’s why outside of movies people don’t go flying backward when they get shot, but instead the bullet penetrates them and totally screws with their innards. So if he imparted enough kinetic energy to rock their brains in their skulls hard enough to cause them to lose consciousness, he’d actually just rip a hole in their skulls and kill them. They’d barely move. The signature image is of him flicking someone’s skull and them exploding backward by feet or even tens of meters. Let’s take a smaller distance. Let’s assume a 90 kg / 198 lb human, and one meter of lateral movement. Let’s assume the center of gravity moves a single meter due to the force, ignoring angular momentum from pivoting around the feet and hips, and gravity. Work (in Joules) = force (Newtons) x distance (meters) Force in Newtons is the product of mass (kg) by acceleration. That means we have to know how fast they move a meter. It’s a rapid lateral movement followed by deceleration as they hit the ground. The acceleration required to produce that one meter lateral movement is close to instantaneous, but let’s call it 0.01 seconds. Force (Newtons) = mass (kg) x acceleration (m/s^2) Superman would have to get the mass moving at a speed of roughly a quarter meter per second in order for inertia and gravity to stop it. And he’d be achieving that speed in 0.01 seconds. That means the acceleration is more like 0.25 * 100 or 25 m/s^2, about 2.5 times gravity. Force = 90 kg x 25 m/s^2 = 2,250 Newtons So per this, Superman has about about 50% more energy in one of his finger flicks than a professional boxer’s punch, packed into something the size of a bullet. And per the Wikipedia reference, that’s about three times the energy of a .357 magnum bullet. Basically, the person’s face would turn to a semiliquid state and disrupt itself as the kinetic energy propagated through the skull in waves. It would be a skull earthquake. The person’s head would just erupt into a geyser of blood, bone shards and gray goo. Yeah, it would be like the scene from Cronenburg’s Scanners, not what is portrayed in the comics. As for Superman sending the Flash a hundred meters? Well, the Flash isn’t invulnerable. His head would have disappeared and bits of his skull would have been found a kilometer away. This is why it’s obvious that Superman’s powers are all actually psychic powers working through unknown physics. Just as you can’t lift a submarine or a plane from a single point of contact without it deforming and breaking around the point of contact, you can’t flick someone with your finger sufficiently hard to displace them through space without blowing up their skulls. See that? That’s 48,000 tons designed to be supported by water over most of its lower half suspended on a single hand. If this were a thing, the hand would deform the steel so rapidly that the hand would disappear inside the submarine, creating a hole. It’s probable that you’d just end up with a Superman-sized hole through the submarine bottom to top. As for whoever he’s carrying under his arm, unless they are as invulnerable as he is, they would be ripped in half on either side of his arm as the submarine enveloped Superman. That means that Superman is actually wrapping the submarine’s lower surface in a massive field of some sort that supports its weight and the hand is merely a prop. In a reality that adhered to basic physics where Superman could actually lift the submarine, no weight would be on his hands. This is apparently the canonical arm-waving explanation that they use to explain it. But of course, the physics of Superman and pretty much every superhero are magic anyway. There’s no actual science involved, just fantasy. And that’s okay. But next time you see Superman flicking someone with his finger and them flying through the air, understand that their head would simply have turned into a red geyser of bone and flesh."},{"prompt":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Echo innovate IT] [URL: https://echoinnovateit.com/] is a mobile app development company based in Chicago.

They were poor like us so I was surprised. But I thought it was so nice of them to think of me. I had all these ideas of what they would have bought for me. So exciting…It was a key chain with the letter W on it. I was ten years old. There is no letter W in my name. But I thanked them, and said it will come in handy when I get a key someday. That was the best I could think of at the moment.I had a bit of money so I went to the thrift store and bought her a key chain with the letter H on it. I had my parents give it to her the next day when we stopped in to get a drink of water after building forts and tunnels in the snow. My parents called her over and gave it to her. She just laughed when she opened it. She said, “Oh wow - this is what I always wanted. Thanks!” We could barely get out the door we were laughing so hard.We had so much fun for years on end bringing up our key chain gifts. We both used it for our first car. People would always question us as to why we had a key chain with the incorrect letter on it.I used my W for my work keys. She married a man whose last name started with an H, and uses it for her extra house keys.Whenever we get a present that is odd in our family, we say that line. Oh wow, this is what I always wanted.

I've always had an issue with dressing myself unless it was a client facing meeting or I had to do a presentation of some sorts. A lot of people don't understand this and I've been hassled about it many times. It came back on nearly every annual review - you dress like shit. And I always reply, I dress what is comfy.. I've came in a workplace (where 75% was brand shirt plus tie - triple suit style) - - and I came like this: The head of the department couldn't believe his eyes, “wtf are you doing R?” but I wasn't send home for it. I wasn't reprimanded. The head of department just shook his head, and said he never met anyone, ever, who went to work in fitness pants. Another day I was wearing a suit on Friday (casual clothing day) and we were told by the administrative ladies to go casual! I was wearing a Metallica t-shirt of my wife - who got this from her mother. The t-shirt was something like the below, you can imagine it turning heads after I took of my shirt. While others where wearing unbranded clothing. I also never do my hair (unless I go for a client facing meeting). So whenever I'm in the office my hair was always like this: I had the nickname of “professor” at one of the firms I was working, given my hair was so out of shape, I reminded the MD of his old professors who had their hair pointing in every direction. Lol. Another thing is, I used to skateboard, so I had this thing with me all the time On my skateboard rucksack, so I occasionally had to go pass security with a bag like this And they often walk towards me…. Thinking I'm some douche bag trying to cause trouble and then realise I actually am employed there as a banker… Whenever I had anyone report into me, I always told him or her, I don't care one shit how you dress, when we go to the client, we dress up to his expectations while if we work internally we dress to our expectations. In case someone complains, they can come to me. I want people who work for me to feel comfortable. Whether they dress in a Hawaiian shirt or in fitness clothing, I don't care. When you are over your 30s, it's not about “statements” anymore it's about comfortable living. I never understood to “dress up” for work if there is no need. I've seen entire back office operations fully suited up. It's ridiculous, because output or quality of these people is generally horseshit. People often phrase “you dress better, it improves your output and whatnot”. All I see expensive clothing do, is you parading around like a proud lion pretending you are a big shot.

Essentially in Roe v Wade the Burger Court made the decision to support one set of beliefs held by Americans against another set of beliefs held by other Americans. In my view that decision was a violation of the First Amendment’s right to believe as we choose. Roe forced a large minority of Americans to accept something they did not believe in often with religious implications. Roe was quite properly negated and the issue returned to the states where the Democratic process must be allowed to function. The States are the only forum suitable for resolving such arguments.

I assume many others have as well. This is my understanding of what string theory is and how it came about. : I think Holger Bec Nielsen had a team of scientists trying to improve Einstein’s ideas. They were at a standstill and started looking at some very old math books for ideas. They came across a picture in an old textbook that looked like a picture commonly worn on t-shirts around smash labs. Since centrifuges were not invented when the old math book was written they were curious about what the book was about. It was about what sounds made on drums and stringed instruments if they vibrated in spaces with more than three dimensions. From this they surmised that very small building blocks were nat particles but more like vibrating elastic bands or strings. From this string there came about. Later people guessed that these strings may be very symmetrical. We then got super-symmetrical strings aka superstrings. Eventually, there were a variety of string theories but Edward Witten showed they were all just different perspectives of the one idea. Later experiments showed that strings were not as symmetrical as suspected. If I recall correctly Holger then was exploring quantum dynamics as a way to find something more complex hidden under string theory, Assuming I recall correctly I suggested a rough sketch of an idea involving randomness with very simple laws similar to Conway's Game of Life. I think Holger then spent a few years exploring that idea. Meanwhile, Lee Smolin and others have been exploring ideas such as Loop Gravity. Loop gravity seems to be similar to String Theory/M-Theory but tries to describe something closer to gravity and work towards explaining particles while string theory seems to more easily explain particles and is working to explain gravity. I think Brian Greene said f the two ideas meet we may get a proper quantum gravity model."},{"prompt":"Why aren’t there major chains of Chinese restaurants?","completion":"Because it would overshadow McDonalds, obviously.

Where do I start from educating myself on other options of investment? I feel dumb when friends around me talk about stock trading.","completion":"While you can engage in stock trading, I would recommend pursuing long-term strategies. These typically require less maintenance and time, relying on data-driven, diversified portfolios to build wealth. They are generally more sustainable, especially for newer investors. In terms of where to specifically start, just begin with simple research amongst content creators and major financial institutions. Vanguard, Fidelity, NerdWallet, and other large financial platforms usually offer content geared towards educating newer investors on basic strategies and bets practices. If you are interested, I produce content for newer investors who are looking to begin their journey. Ultimately, your strategies and portfolio allocations will depend on your personal investor goals and risk tolerance.

You can have the will and the determination to get something accomplished, but your will alone isn't enough. You have to make changes in your life if you want to be successful. There was things I wanted to get away from but I couldn't as long as I kept myself in a position up doing the same things over and over. Going to the same places, seeing the same people. There must be a new normal. No matter how bad you want to accomplish a goal,unless, you make changes to make it possible it won't happen. It doesn't matter how bad you want it. If it were possible to attain the way you're doing things now ,you would already have done whatever it is you are willing your way to. Having the will to to do something, the determination, that's all great. That is terrific assets to have. That alone, it's been my experience, doesn't accomplish a whole lot though.

What does a typical day look like? What are their responsibilities? What do they do to grow their company every day?","completion":"The day to day activities of a startup CEO evolve over time as the company grows. The specifics of that path differ depending on the industry and business model. Here's my answer for a software/internet technology startup CEO. 1. Identify a vision, around a really important problem that the startup can uniquely solve. 2. Figure out what resources you need to start to prove that your vision is correct... and assemble those resources (usually money and people). You will be constantly raising money and hiring people, along with any other key resources needed for your particulary business opportunity. 3. Identify the business model you will use to solve your customers' problem in a way that ultimately makes money. Will you be selling a product or a service? How much will you charge? How much will it cost you at first and at scale? 4. Make and execute realistic plans, in chunks or stages. Your plans should be designed to answer specific questions about your business that convince others that your vision about the opportunity is correct, and over time remove specific risks associated with your business. For example:+ prove the need you've identified is real by talking with potential customers (survey) + prove your proposed solution to the customers' problem will technically work by building a prototype. In addition to actually working, does it satisfy the customer and make them happy?+ prove that your business model is sound by selling your prototype to some customers. Are they willing to pay what you expected? Does it cost as much to offer your product/service as you thought? 5. Increase the value of your business and repeat. Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 as you grow. As a startup CEO, you need to be a \\"player/coach.\\" You need to actually do the work, not just manage people who do the work. It helps if you have a functional expertise in addition to general management expertise. I see a lot of startup CEOs who are good at engineering, sales or product management. You need to balance being strategic with being opportunistic. As you make plans and execute them, you will always have scarce resources. So you need to be very focussed on the questions you need to answer to raise the next round of cash, and hire the next group of teammates. Silicon Valley generally works on a series of investment stages, like seed round, Series A, Series B, etc. Be aware of the questions you need to answer, and the risk you're removing at each stage. Think like you're doing a series of experiments that prove your vision is correct, and prove that you can create a good fit between your product/service and your customers' needs. Find trusted advisors along the way and ask for their help. But ultimately listen to your gut instincts when making tough decisions."},{"prompt":"Deepika Padukone slept with Akhay Kumar during the shooting of Desi Bozy?","completion":"Yes I have heard an intimate story on the sets of desi boys, here is the story… Ready??

Next, ask them if they think anyone and everyone should have access to a nuclear weapons stockpile or chemical weapons, etc. If they believe that some weapons should be regulated in some circumstances, it obviously means they are not totally, absolutely in favor of access to every kind of weapon for every kind of human being on the planet."},{"prompt":"What is the practical value of the bottom number in a time signature? I get the top number intuitively but the bottom number remains a mystery to me as a decent guitarist of 25 years only now trying to learn theory.","completion":"The upper one tells you how many there are, The lower one tells you what kind they are. Most usually we see 4 at the bottom. It means each of the beats 1234 1234 is a quarter note in length. If you're tapping your foot you're tapping out quarter notes 3 over 4 works the same. Find the pulse and tap it, 123 123. That's also quarter notes you are tapping 3 over 8 means three eighth notes to a bar. Brisker. That is a quick three to a bar. What you'd tap then goes quickly while the actual music does its own thing in time to it. If the lower figure is 2, these beats are a half note long. 3 over 2 is a stately or sad three to a bar. 4 over 2 is a stately or sad four pulses to a bar. I hope that helped.

While the speed of electricity/charge is almost the speed of the light (300 000km/sec), the drift velocity of electrons is usualy less than 1mm/sec. USB cable & charging The most important for a USB cable is the internal cable section, measured as AWG - bigger section (= lower AWG) is better. AWG24 is a good common USB cable (0.2mm2 wire section, 0.5mm wire diam, 2A max current). AWG22 is a very good USB cable (0.33m2 wire section, 0.64mm wire diam, 5A max current). The lenght of the cable is important, but only if it is long enough to make his internal resistance dropping to much voltage. That being said, the battery is charged by an electronic circuit that has some max specifications. Even if using a 2000mA capable cable, the max charge can be at 600mA because of the electronics... Another thing about charging batteries : the standard technology used with most of the portable devices (Lithium) accepts a safe charge (to keep battery long duration and many charge cycles) of 0.5C = 0.5 x battery capacity. Eg for a battery of 3Ah the charge current must not exceed 1.5A (0.5 x 3). Which means approx 2 hours of charge. If the charging time is longer this will protect the battery AND the charging circuit (which gets less hot if lower currents). Data rate Although the communication speeds today are very fast (giga bit per second) all is handled as series of binary data (0/1). It's just the oscilation/radio frequency (and sometimes the parallelism) that creates this throughput. In the radio waves - higher frequency means higher data rate BUT lower range. Microwaves oven Microwaves is \\"just\\" radio waves. But powerfull enough to shake molecules (and so product heat in the matter). More mobile molecules (like liquids) are easier to heat. A microwaves oven always works at 100% of his power. Using it at 30% means using it 30% of the time at 100% of his power. Tags Most of the tags used in RFID have no internal energy source (althoug they have an electronic circuit). The energy is captured from the radio waves emitted by another device (called \\"reader\\"). GPS The GPS is a radio device. A network of 31 sattelites flying at 20000km today send their positions (in the bands of 1.22/1.57GHz at 50bit/sec) to the ground. Every digital device needs to see at least 4 satelites to be able to calculate his position. Light bulbs The led bulbs have electronic cards inside to handle their power supply ! So actually when you buy a led bulb, you buy an AC/DC power supply. A led bulb has usually many small leds connected in series. So if a small led gets broken maybe the bulb stops working - but you can repair it by replacing the broken led. Also his power supply is usually intact."},{"prompt":"Which is the best travel portal development company?","completion":"Hi, If you are looking the website for your travel business,i can suggest you one of the best web development company developed a travel portal for me.

I have two friends who are both Special Agents. The FBI employs approximately 35,000 people, including special agents and support professionals such as intelligence analysts, language specialists, scientists, and information technology specialists. It is an institution, and the vast majority are rank and file Americans who have undergone a vetting process that many Americans would not make it through. As an institution, I trust them. There has been no evidence of widespread corruption. There have been some leaders who were corrupt (including their original leader, J. Edgar Hoover). However, the institution remained as it was - a very large organization of Americans who had somehow passed through their strict recruiting process, and became employees. Most of them have tended to be Republicans. Most of them, have tended to be fairly religious, and fairly regimented, and fairly “straight and narrow” and focused on strict law enforcement. A lot of them have ended up being Mormons (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) — because that religion tends to shelter the young, and preaches the “evils” of any drugs, and alcohol, or sex outside of marriage. There have been exceptions, to be sure. As mentioned, J. Edgar Hoover was a frighteningly corrupt human being. (Even if those in his institution were not). The FBI has allowed two enemy spies to rise to relatively high levels in security agencies, during its history. (Google the names Robert Hanssen, and CIA agent Aldrich Ames). Fortunately, both of them were caught by others in the agency, and both ended up in federal prison. Institutions are made up of people. Whether it is a hospital, or a school, or a police force, or a private corporation such as IBM or Microsoft or Google or Amazon or Walmart. Thousands of people. Just because the current head of the Department of Justice (William Barr) has a long, long history of corruption — going back to Reagan’s Iran-Contra Scandal — does not mean that I mistrust the entire Department of Justice. That fact does not magically change the people who make up the other 34,999 people who make up the FBI. Large institutions are still made up of people. Individual people. In this case, about 35,000 people. I trust the institution, but I do not trust the current leader. The current leader can (and is) ordering his underlings to conduct investigations for no reason. I get that. It will be a waste of time, and resources, and the staff must comply. I once had a boss who was corrupt. He was finally charged with 17 felonies. Many (most) of the staff recognized his corruption. I did. At no time did I engage in any corrupt activities. I was ordered — at times — to do things that I knew were silly, and a waste of resources, and a waste of time. I had no choice. But, I never engaged in anything corrupt, even though my boss did. In fact, I was one of a few who finally spoke out, in confidence, in a deposition — to help to end his leadership. Human beings can be corrupt. Institutions are made up of a lot of human beings. Yes, it is possible (and even likely) that a few will be corrupt. And, in a few cases, it is possible that some who are corrupt will rise in the ranks to a position of power. Shit happens. That does not mean the entire institution “cannot be trusted.” One must focus on what the leadership does, and assume that those actions are the actions of that individual human being. That does not mean that the other 34,999 are somehow “corrupt.”"},{"prompt":"What did you read today that made you say, Is this real life!?","completion":"Quora articles."},{"prompt":"there anything Turkic about Azerbaijani culture (other than language)?","completion":"Again, someone has seen few things in common between Azerbaijanis and Iranians and has concluded that we are just a weird language speaking crypto-Iranians.

Definitely. However, the interest rate is likely to be substantially higher than that of an “average” borrower. That’s because there’s a greater likelihood that the bad credit borrower will default on the loan, Not all lenders will lend to someone with bad credit. Depending on how bad the credit it, the money might have to be borrowed from a lender who specializes in high-risk loans. There also may be additional conditions attached to the loan. Maybe the loan can’t be unsecured—that is, borrowed without any collateral. In that case, the borrower might have to pledge something of value—a car, for instance—which the borrower would lose if he/she defaulted on the loan. Maybe the borrower would need to have a co-signer—someone who agrees to pay if the borrower defaulted on the loan. Big picture: The lender wants to make sure that it will come out ahead even if the borrower defaults. One piece of advice: Work on improving the credit. The higher the credit score, the fewer conditions will come along with the loan."},{"prompt":"What’s going on with all the fires in Russia? Is this sabotage? Ukrainian special forces?

Microwave heating has the advantages of fast heating speed and less damage to nutrients in food. its main principle is to make the water in food produce molecular oscillation, release energy, and then play the role of heating. no new substances are produced in the process. In addition, the radiation produced by the microwave oven is non-ionizing radiation, which is usually not harmful to the human body. So using a microwave oven won't cause cancer. Cancer is mainly a malignant tumor. at present, the specific cause of the disease is still unclear. the possible main causes include chemical factors such as alkylating agents, acylating agents, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, ethylnaphthamine, aflatoxins, and physical factors such as ionizing radiation. biological carcinogenic factors such as carcinogenic viruses, as well as genetic factors, have nothing to do with the use of microwave heating. However, if the microwave oven is not used correctly, such as burning or burning food during heating, harmful substances such as acrylamide may be produced, and long-term excessive intake may have a certain carcinogenic effect. In addition, we should also pay attention to the selection of microwave ovens of standard quality, and when heating food, pay attention to the use of suitable microwave ovens and quality and safe containers, so as not to produce harmful substances during heating, which is not conducive to human health after eating. What things can't be put in the microwave oven?In general, the instructions provided with the microwave oven will be described in For example, there are many functional introductions and matters needing attention in the toshiba air fryer microwave instructions. Food with membrane or shell is not suitable for microwave heating, it is easy to explode and hurt people, such as eggs, and eggs without eggshells are not allowed. Foods high in fat and low in moisture. Such as cheese, nuts, pork, etc., these foods have little moisture and are easy to scorch or explode after microwave heating. In addition, dried fish, dried meat and so on should also pay attention to, the water content is too low, microwave heating is very easy to paste, resulting in carcinogens. As the microwave heating water, the water does not flow, but the temperature rises, it may exceed the boiling point and there is no sign of boiling. At this time, as long as there is a slight disturbance, such as opening the microwave door to get the water cup, the water inside will boil violently, causing scalds. Of course, apart from food, these utensils can not be put in the microwave oven. Any containers containing metal (aluminum bowls, stainless steel bowls, gold-patterned porcelain cups or porcelain plates), paper boxes, ordinary food packages bought outside (ordinary plastic bags and plastic wrap), these can not be heated in the microwave oven!

Quantum physics and General relativity are two of the most successful theories in Physics but unfortunately — they don’t work together. We know, Quantum physics describes and predicts the effects in the tiny world of particles. Likewise, General relativity works perfectly for predicting how gravity works in the big world of planets, stars, and galaxies. But they are incompatible—gravity can’t be explained in the quantum world—and there must be a reason. So, String Theory attempts to resolve this incompatibility with conclusively explaining all the Matter and Forces in our universe. And grew up as the Theory of Everything. HYPOTHESIS : String theory suggests that what we think of as particles of Matter (Quarks and Leptons) and Force Carriers (Gauge Bosons and Scalar Bosons) are actually vibrating one-dimensional energy strings. This is the standard model of elementary particles. The list doesn’t include the hypothetical particle - Graviton (possibly a Gauge Boson) So, Strings vibrating at different frequencies adopt different states—at one frequency one could be an electron (Matter Particle), while at another frequency it could be a photon (Force Carrier)—resulting in different particles. It could be possible that blue vibrating strings form Matter particles and red vibrating strings form Force carrier particles. And this is because their frequencies are different. (The diagram is just for illustrative purposes.) PREDICTIONS : It also predicts that there may be many more dimensions than we are familiar with—up to 26 dimensions may exist that we are unaware of. The dimensions would exist at such a small scale that it would be impossible to detect them—even with the most powerful machines. Let me give you an example - Look at your mobile charger cable (or something like that). If I ask you to tell me the dimensions of your cable, you might reply with its length. Conclusion 1 :- We consider a mobile charger cable as a 1-Dimensional object. . . But now imagine a highly intelligent microscopic ant which is moving up-down (across the circumference), left-right, back and forth on your charger cable. And then, if I ask the ant to tell the dimensions of the charger cable, then the ant will reply with its length, breadth and height. Conclusion 2 :- The ant considers a mobile charger cable as a 3-Dimensional object. . . Conclusion 3 = Conclusion 1 + Conclusion 2 Conclusion 3 : If we go deeper and deeper from macroscopic level to microscopic level, we can access more dimensions. (as in this case, a human perceives the cable as a 1-Dimensional object but the same object for a microscopic ant is having 3-Dimensions) It also predicts that the familiar subatomic particles (which build Matter) should have been created in the Big Bang along with some unfamiliar particles (which build Antimatter), but that these would have disappeared (or decayed) within moments of their creation. EVIDENCE: There is no evidence to support this theory. Everything is assumed and predicted. And the simple reason is - Our current understanding of Physics is not enough to get more of this theory. Although we are trying, we are still slightly uncomfortable about these brain-blending concepts."},{"prompt":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

What may be considered humane by some could still involve the taking of a person's life, which many individuals and organizations find morally objectionable. That being said, there have been various methods employed throughout history that have been viewed as attempts to carry out executions in a more humane manner. Here are a few examples: 1. Lethal Injection: Lethal injection is a method used in several countries, including the United States, to execute individuals on death row. It typically involves a combination of drugs that aim to induce unconsciousness, stop breathing, and ultimately lead to cardiac arrest. However, even lethal injection has faced criticism due to concerns over potential pain and suffering caused by inadequate administration of the drugs. 2. Nitrogen Hypoxia: This method involves the administration of pure nitrogen gas to induce hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, leading to a painless death. It is argued that nitrogen hypoxia may be a more humane method as it causes a gradual loss of consciousness without the feeling of suffocation associated with other gas-based methods. Nitrogen hypoxia has not been widely adopted yet but has been proposed as an alternative in some jurisdictions. 3. Firing Squad with Sedation: In some instances, a firing squad execution has been carried out with the addition of a sedative to minimize any potential suffering or distress experienced by the individual being executed. This approach aims to render the person unconscious before the firing squad delivers the lethal shots. It is important to recognize that debates surrounding capital punishment often focus not only on the method of execution but also on the ethical, moral, and legal considerations related to the death penalty itself. Public opinion varies significantly on the acceptability and effectiveness of capital punishment, and many countries have abolished it altogether. Ultimately, discussions about humane methods of execution are part of a broader conversation regarding the ethical implications and societal consequences of the death penalty."},{"prompt":"What happens when a title search doesn't find an HOA associated with a house that is being purchased then the HOA president claims the title search company made a mistake and the house belongs to the HOA?","completion":"Well, this is pretty simple actually… The fact that a property is part of an HOA is part of the public records of the deeds. So there’s one of two things. Either the HOA president is lying, or the title search was incomplete. The HOA president should be able to show the public records to back up the claim. If they can’t, then you don’t worry. If they do, then, if you got title insurance from the company that did the title search, you need to look at what the title insurance actually covers. Depending on that, you may be able to get some money — maybe even make the title company take the house off your hands.

Another thing I see a lot is people not heating the gel for long enough. I like to let mine get to a rolling boil for about 5–10 seconds to make sure the agarose is thoroughly dissolved. Sometimes for high % ones I swirl it then boil a second time.Before you add whatever reporter you’re using, like etBr or SYBR, it’s critical that your agarose is heated enough. Once added, swirl the mixture to make sure it’s fully diffused or you’ll get little ‘cloudy’ spots when you image. Once you pour your gel, be patient! If you pull the comb out too early, you’ll ruin your wells. If you have any bubbles when you first pour, use a pipette tip to pop them or drag them to the bottom of the gel where they won’t interfere with your bands during imaging. This needs to be done immediately after pouring your gel, or you’ll end up with small distortions (usually crooked bands) in your data. Also; If you keep high concentration stock buffer, double check that there is no precipitate before diluting for use. Sometimes 100x or 10x stocks, when left too long, start to have previously dissolved components like TRIS or boric acid come out of the solution.

[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://thecourpuses.quora.com/Read-at-your-own-risk]People love reading books but there are equal or even more people who hate reading books. A writer must aim to attract readers from the second section and believe me they won't be interested to read the books which are currently trending on the list. They want things to be said in a simple yet interesting way. Problem 1: Fancy Vocabulary doesn’t make you a great writer. This generation has writers who focus more on vocabulary but not the story and the plot. Not every English speaking person knows what the word \\"Sonorous\\" actually means. Yet we come across these kinds of words almost in every novel. This isn't bad, this works well for exams like GRE but this doesn't attract the reader. I will prefer reading an Autobiography instead of searching the synonym of a word every 2 minutes. Use these words but not very often, try mastering the screenplay with simple but meaningful words. Here's an example of director Trivikram's screenplay: Situation: Character A's daughter fell in love with her driver. Dialogue: (A says to his daughter) Worlds might collide but no hard work will reduce the distance between the front and the rear seat. Simple, yet artistic. Nolan's screenplay: Talking about the Mathematics behind physics, Neils Bohr asks Oppenheimer \\"The important thing isn't can you read the music, it can you hear it. Can you hear the music, Robert?\\" This is a beautiful line where the musical notes refer to equations of physics and hearing the music refers to the imagination of physics. Problem 2: I see many writers completely describing a scene and they concentrate on the details more than the emotion of the scene. This isn't a problem with experienced writers but there is another problem. OVER DESCRIPTION OF A SIMPLE SCENE. My inspiration is derived from Kalki Krishnamurthy's Ponniyin Selvan Novels. Where he describes some of the scenes so well and leaves some to writer's imagination. A writer must not stress a reader to imagine everything. If he wants to do so, start a scene in a simple way and build the scene properly and in the end use all of your skills. Of course this is a lengthy process but a reader gets attached to the story and imagines it completely, not the way you wanted them to but the way they like. I think the above two issues are something that had to be addressed on a social media platform, hence I did it. ~[LINKED_TEXT: Sudhamsh Reddy] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Sudhamsh-Reddy-22]"},{"prompt":"w do I start a successful YouTube channel and become a YouTuber?","completion":"The Strength of Partaking in “the long game” in Internet Ventures for Beginners I have had the fortune to instruct and advise to countless aspiring businesspeople.

I was living in a small town of about 900 people, walking along our school’s baseball fields with two of my friends. I was in elementary school at the time (probably the 4th or 5th grade), crossing the fields from a basketball court going home, when I looked down and spotted and old metal object covered in dirt. I dug it up and it turned out to be a handgun. We took the gun home and showed my parents who then reported it to the police. A police officer stopped by and retrieved the handgun, which it turns out was lost by one of the local town-folk, who never reported it missing. I remember seeing an article published in our local newspaper about our “act of valor” and thinking to myself, well of course we’re going to report a lost gun to the police - What else would we have done? Now that I’m older, I’m amused by how naive I was about the incident as a kid."},{"prompt":"What are some suggestions for a math HL IA topic in calculus?","completion":"It’s quite funny how (almost) everyone doing the IB would have the thought process of the following when finding a topic for their Math IA: What topic I should choose?2. What should I do with that topic? Which in this case, your topic is Calculus and now you’re pondering topics on what should you be doing on Calculus. However, the right process (at least in my opinion) should be: What problems do I have?2. How can I tackle this problem? And I think by thinking in this fashion, you would have a fresh start in tackling your problem. You are not bounded by any restrictions that you should use calculus or whatever topic to solve such a problem. Moreover, the tools that are needed to solve your particular problem would be present by itself when it is needed. Now, up to this point, my answer would definitely not seemed to be answering your question. But bear with me; observe the following example. This would require some imagination. Imagine you have a box of equal length, width and height [math]l[/math] with volume [math]V[/math]. Suppose you want to compress this box, making it smaller over some interval [math]t[/math]. Now your sister suddenly comes and asks you out of curiosity, “can you know how fast or slow the box shrinks when being compressed?”. And you’d become annoyed, why would you waste your time answering such nonsense of a question (but truthfully you just don’t know). Then, the stakes gets higher, your sister said: “I would give you £10 if you could answer my question just now”. Now you have some motivation. You tell her to give you some 10 minutes to figure it out. Then there were you, thinking how can you tackle this problem. How can someone measure the change of volume? It is just absurd. Or is it not? Well after some hard session of brainstorming you tell your sister to give you an extra 10 minutes. You then figure out one way to measure this change. “How about I measure the change in length of the sides of the cube?” you ponder. And then you really tried the method, you measure the change not just in length, but in width and in height altogether. You write down some data you’ve found and you see there is a pattern formed. In particular, you see all the sides of the cube (length, width and height) decreased at a constant rate together. When the height is 3 cm, the length is 3 cm and so is the height. You compressed even further, all the sides have equal length of 2 cm. A spectacular pattern. But still, that’s just a measure of change in length over time. You still couldn’t describe the change in volume. You take a peek at the clock and there’s 5 minutes left. Your £10 is going to fly off. And then you remember the some calculus that you’ve learned in class. It never clicked for you but that shade of memory just suddenly plays in your mind. The chain rule! From your experiment you’ve found out a function of all the sides of the cube, we called it [math]l(t)[/math] which varies as time varies. And you know from elementary geometry that the volume of a cube is just the length, height and width of the cube multiplied. We have now, [math]V = l^3[/math]. [math]V[/math] is a function of [math]l.[/math] So the rate of change that we have measured was just [math]dfrac{dV}{dl} = 3l^2[/math]. And we can find the rate of change of the length of which we now know the function by experiment by differentiating that particular function, [math]dfrac{dl}{dt}= l'(t)[/math]. Then by the chain rule, we conclude that the rate of change of volume of the cube is given by: [math]dfrac{dV}{dt} = dfrac{dV}{dl} dfrac{dl}{dt} = 3l^2 l'(t)[/math] And by plugging in all the numbers needed, you found the rate of change of volume and get your £10. Now the point here is, in your IB life, you need to find a problem, find a motivation for that problem, and in solving that problem you would encounter all the tools that you’ve learned like calculus. And in that moment, you will be surprised that you might even need topics you’ve learned that you’ve never imagined how to use it, but you suddenly just… need it. And that’s the proper motivation that you should seek. Well, some readers would think that my example was too simple. Or it is not even considered calculus. Well my point here is not show some rigorous calculus or whatnot. My point is the idea of finding a nice IA topic. Of course I can entice you into awesomely nice topics that the study of calculus allows you. Like for example how you can use Taylor series to do a linear analysis on a system, but that would require too much backstory, and my my point wouldn’t be concise. Nevertheless, go find a problem, get some motivation, think hard how to solve it and solve it."},{"prompt":"Are there any health benefits to feeding my kitten carrots and greens?","completion":"No, they can't process any of that.

We’re hearing a lot of chatter these days about a looming recession¹. They do happen, and you will experience one or two… or more… along the way. So what the deuce is a recession, you ask? Well, it can mean different things to different people, but common traits are a decline in consumer confidence (experience-based or rumor-based) due perhaps to job loss and reduced or stagnant wages that encourages folks to change their shopping habits. When those things occur, the natural result is moderated shopping and a decline in business investment activity. In short, the economy shrinks, and the Gross National Product (GNP), the broad measure of a country’s economy, goes negative. There’s no approximate period for how long recessions lasts, but they often linger for more than 6 months². The early 1990s recession lasted 8 months causing a GNP deterioration of 1.4%. Ten years later, the early 2000s slump lasted 8 months resulting in a GNP decline of 0.3%. Six years later, the mortgage crisis-inspired Great Recession reared its ugly head, driving the GNP down 5.1%. That recession ended 10 years ago. So, if you feel a recession coming on, what do you do? I’m guessing you already have a plan, but if not, make one and stick with it. Here are some tips based on my own experience. Protect Your Assets So how do we protect our assets from these dastardly recessions? In response to this question, I’m inclined to bring up my PDQ Principles of investing –Patience, Diversification and Quality. Hopefully, as an investor, you already practice some or all three of these principles as part of your plan. But allow me to elaborate beginning with patience. Patience is such an important personal trait to exercise during a recession. It manifests itself in several ways. Stay calm. Follow your plan. Don’t let surging emotions take over, which often lead to irrational and impulsive decisions. Just remember, if you’ve made quality investment choices, once the economy begins to recover – and it always does – those wise, diversified investments you made prior to the recession will also recover. But what if I need my money very soon, you mutter? I would answer, do you need it all right now? If not, don’t be impulsive and sell everything if you need only some smaller portion of your investment dollars. Just remember, in a declining market your fear of loss is stronger than usual, and impulsive decisions can lead to a much greater financial setback than the situation might warrant. Diversify As to that diversification principle, particularly in an economic downturn, it helps limit losses and often creates opportunities for a quicker recovery. I’m inclined to favor broad market index funds for young investors. But as an individual matures and is financially able to afford a broader scope of investing, a diversified portfolio might also include – in addition to stock funds – bonds, real estate (usually a young investor’s home), even some small-scale exposure to other real estate and… mmm… commodities. And, of course, whether young or old, six months to a year or more of rainy day funds (cash) will come in very handy – possibly enabling you to avoid selling any of your investments to meet unexpected short-term needs and/or emergencies. If you’re not inclined to go the fund route to achieve diversification, at least try to identify investment-grade bonds and/or companies with quality assets, little debt, and good cash flow. And in that same vein, look inward because the same rules apply to your own household. Your chances of outlasting a recession are much more likely if you have that rainy day fund, a small debt load, and steady employment (cash flow) to cover those dastardly bills that keep on coming. Keep it Quality Trust your judgment. If you’ve saved that important rainy day fund (cash or near-cash), and if you stick with your quality investments, you can ride the usual recession back to prosperity. And please keep in mind, bailing out of your investments in the face of a downturn can lock in untimely gains, triggering taxes, or real losses – or both. If you trust that “quality” portfolio, and if you exercise patience, those “paper losses” are most likely to be temporary in nature. And ask yourself this question. If I do decide to sell, when do I buy back in? During the inevitable recovery, most of the folks who do get back in, often do so late in the recovery cycle, suffering what I call “opportunity losses” as well as those real ones incurred by selling during the downturn. Timing your way in and out of a market is a losing game. Don’t fall victim to it unless uncontrollable circumstances force the issue. Don’t Sell, Buy If you feel a recession coming on, consider making small, frequent automatic investments – perhaps in your 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan at work. And keep doing it throughout the recession and beyond. It’s called dollar-cost averaging, a system that buys you more shares when prices are lower. And keep reinvesting any surplus earnings (like dividends) for the same reason… lower share prices. Remember, if you’re either anticipating or experiencing a recession, don’t join the thundering herd and become a seller. Recessions create buying opportunities. Don’t miss out by selling out. ‍ ¹Recession: A period of general economic decline defined as a contraction in the Gross Domestic Product (GNP) for a period of six months (two consecutive quarters) or longer. Much milder than a depression, a recession often doesn’t last too far beyond a year and is marked by high unemployment, stagnant wages, and a decline in manufacturing, retail sales and the aforementioned GNP, a measurement of economic output. ²The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 was 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, a period that included the Great Depression (NBER Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions)."},{"prompt":"What is the best way to invest in gold through SIP?","completion":"To invest in gold through SIP, you must have a basic knowledge of mutual funds and the know hows on how to go about it.

That being said, according to a recent study, only 56% of businesses make it their fifth year since inception. This means that 44% of companies fail within the first five years. The number one reason for startup failures, according to CB Insights, is the lack of market need for the product or service. You may have great talent and a passion for making your business a success, which are the most important factors of a great entrepreneur.

However, I think India is a pseudo-democracy. The reason for this is, leaving aside national elections, very few people understand the election process at the local and state level or even vote. As a result there is no accountability and elected officials do what they want and can ignore corruption and benefit from it. For example, consider the issuing of driver's license. The office is called RTO - Regional Transport Office. It is run by touts/middle men. If you have a problem, you can be harassed for days. Who do you complain to? Can you tell the RTO head that he is a incompetent fool? You can't. Because you don't know who he is. Even if you do know who he is, you can't come close to his office. Can you complain to some elected official? I don't know who that is, nor do I know how to approach his office, nor do I know how he got elected or the election process. I do know that he lives in a house which is so opulent that it looks like the house of a South American drug lord. In the US, citizens know who they are voting for, how to contact their elected officials and let them know there is a problem. They can tell the officials to 'fix it or else...you don't get my vote'. That is the meaning of democracy! I am not sure how things ended up this way in both countries. I also think it's unfortunate that we Indians are willing to put up with this."},{"prompt":"When Jordan annexed the West Bank was there any Palestinian resistance against Jordanian rule?

The core of it, for those of us who believe in One True God (SWA) — again, giving Christianity a break on the Trinity here — is that pagans do not worship the God of Abraham. To the three Abrahamic religions, worshiping Allah is in and of itself morally superior to any non Abrahamic practices. Aside from that, I’d argue that’s the only thing morally superior, as some pagan religions embrace things like altruism similar to Abrahamic religions."},{"prompt":"Why has indexed shifting displaced traditional friction shifting on bicycles?","completion":"I had a bike where the cassette (rear gear) was indexed and the chain ring (front gear) was friction. I found it easy to use. Back in the day, bikes had five cassette gears. It was easy to set the friction lever to a good position for each gear. As the number of gears increased, the spacing between the gears got smaller. It became harder to find the correct lever position to keep the chain centered on the gear. If I could, I would go back to those early days on a modern bike, but have the gears spaced further apart. (I mean a larger difference in the number of teeth in each gear.) Indexed shifting works well when it works. But it’s finicky and hard to set up correctly. When it isn’t set up well, I have to start playing games to get the chain in the gear I want, such as shift down one click, then put a little pressure in the downshift position to get the chain to drop into the lower gear."},{"prompt":"Can you write something that will make me feel the true size of infinity?","completion":"NO!

Other explanation for these things can be, he/she might be an exteovert and loves to hangout with you or other people. However if some other person who is not your friend (let it be a stranger) helps you in your most tough situation, what would you call them then !!? so its more of a personal quality thing, if a person is good and helping by nature he will help even without asking, but if a person is rude and doesn't like helping people, he might even find a way to excuse himself from you, no matter how good you are friends with them. A friendship doesnt bind anyone to do things for you.

This way when it's useful to the target group it automatically earns money, profit. For startup ideas, I was searching for issues that need a solution. 1. Majority of college going crowd in India are not job ready. They don't know how to prepare a resume, how to face an interview, how to write an email, how to apply for a job - prepare a job application. SOLUTION : - Training them but requires college permission. - An job agency that does it for them. 2. Environmental damage is a much talked about topic. It is causing natural disasters and can lead to submerging of cities and countries under oceans. SOLUTION : A media (print / electronic / digital) company that spreads awareness on saving environment. 3. Sex education is missing in many developing and under developed countries. Awareness about periods, STDs, female & male anatomy, sexual health problems like premature ejaculation, phimosis, etc are missing. SOLUTION : Online training via app or website. This can be self paced. 4. There are TV channels dedicated just to news. But, no radio channels like that. Radio is accessible on the go on mobile, automobiles, etc and has more rural penetration. Currently there are only news bulletins for 30 mins or so on radios. SOLUTION : A radio channel dedicated only to news. Keep in mind the high licensing cost for radio spectrum, to be paid to govt. 5. I have seen elderly people, including my parents, struggle with the use of devices and apps. Not just social media, but basic functions like sending an SMS. There are many useful functions and apps across devices that can make their lives easier but they need basic knowledge. I noticed an elderly struggle to make an emergency call on her smartphone when her spouse was medically critical. Her Children weren't near her. She was always used to receiving calls, hardly made calls. Whenever there is a glitch or an issue with a device, they have to be dependent on others or travel down to a service centre for even tiny things. What appears very easy and normal for youngsters appears herculean for elderly. This is made tougher due to elders staying alone. SOLUTION : Train and guide elderly citizens with use of gadgetry, devices, apps, social media, etc. Plus frequent maintenance of the devices. It could also include an on-call 24/7 support to answer any queries they might have. (I know my parents will love this :) ) 6. Startups have a lot of assets - Tangible and Intangible built over many years. But, when a startup sinks, all this goes waste. This could be their infrastructure, contact DB, their brand and logo, etc. If these can be monetized, it could generate additional revenues. SOLUTION : A marketplace for trading startup assets - especially true in the case of struggling, failed startups or those that are scaling down ops where entrepreneurs just want to wind up and move forward. This can help them in cash flow issues and sustain till they make critical profits. 7. When digital newspapers, magazines, ebooks, WhatsApp messages, Facebook posts and even Google search can be in vernacular languages, I hardly see emails (newsletters, updates, transactional, one to one, etc) in any language apart from English. Also, why should emails only be text? Why not a voice based or video based email? These can help break the language barrier and make emails accessible to the illiterate too. SOLUTION : Vernacular email system. Possibly audio and/or video based."},{"prompt":"CNN reported that 1,000 US health experts have demanded that businesses not be allowed to reopen, but protestors should not be criticized for violating suggestions and increasing infection risks.

First, what I do not like: When the the character you are playing or the vehicle you are driving (in third person games) generally remains the same size during gameplay. Or when enemies mostly remain the same size and the game essentially becomes a shooting gallery (static perspective, and you shoot enemies as they pop out in various parts of the image.) I really like cinematic games. By this I mean games where the gameplay perspective moves up and down and side to side and zooms in and zooms out as can be done with a movie camera. In other words, the game visuals are more dynamic and your perspective often changes. I am talking about while you are playing the game, not cutscenes. Some of the upcoming next-gen games are doing this. Another movie-like visual effect I like to see in games is depth of field, where objects closer to you are in focus and those farther away are out of focus. Also, I think games are more realistic when there are intentional flaws/randomness in in the environment and in the player’s movement. Nothing makes me feel like I’m “playing a game” (as opposed to feeling like I am in the environment) more than the typical perfectly straight and smooth motion when my character moves forward or turn from side to side. A simple example of what I prefer is a slight “rocking” back and forth when the character is moving. Lastly, a related point. No matter how realistic the visuals, many games, even fantasy games, still take place on relatively flat surfaces, where the rules of Earth gravity apply. Also, many games are focused on combating and killing enemies, and perhaps solving some puzzles along the way. Those kinds of games can be a blast to play, but it’s a shame that more game designers don’t start with a blank piece of paper and create truly original environments, goals, and characters. I suppose that is true of all of the storytelling arts, so I am not singling out video games. Bottom line, if a game does not break the rules in some way and has largely static perspectives and perfectly fluid movements, I do not care how photorealistic the rendering."},{"prompt":"What's the next number in the series: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11?","completion":"The answer could also be 14, considering that a set sequence is all that is provided.

Social scientists have a look at people, which locations sensible and ethical restrictions on what we do that physicists and chemists do now not should address.

Indeed, for many social scientists, it is not feasible to create an experiment at all - as an anthropologist I examine huge scale social institutions. On a sensible stage, it is not viable to either run an synthetic test, or even to capture all the viable facts for a given phenomenon.

Could Flanders ever become independent or join the Netherlands in the future?","completion":"Most people don't know the history of that area, back in the 1500s Belgium and Netherlands were combined and ruled by the Hapsburgs called The Spanish Netherlands. During and after the 30 Years War 1618–1648 France began a campaign to Attack the southern part of it, and they also began an Independence movement where Amsterdam would flood its own city to rid themselves of Spanish troops, they would release the water from the sleuces or dikes. As Independence came closer France kept attacking the Belgium part due to their French speaking, Catholic ways, while Netherlands were more German and Protestant, so a split seemed logical. Napoleon was the last Tyrant that tried to keep them together, but by the Revolutions of 1820 and 1830 Belgium was freed under their own king and Netherlands ruled by the House of Orange, but was more like a Republic. However, Belgium was condemned by the world after their genocide in the Congo in the 1800s, so their movement again would have to wait. After WW1 Belgium lost its kingdom and the borders redone again, but the minority of German speaking Protestant peoples of Flanders in Belgium were ruled by the French leaning Catholics. Since Benelux started the European Union after WW2, they again had more freedom and now began to be able to move as they wished within the EU nations, which appeased them for the time being, but what about the ones who just want to stay and cry foul of arbitrary border drawing? Today, we now have the free East Belgium movement, similar too the Basque in Spain, but much less violent. But The EU has real political issues now that England is gone and many countries are on the verge of bankruptcy like Portugal, Greece and Italy. Who bails them all out? Germany. So the German speaking or Flemish speaking Belgians are emboldened to get the change that they want.

A little girl, I believe she was 9 years old at the time, was admitted a few days after me and was placed in the room beside mine. She was the only girl under 13 there. I was one of the few older girls that she trusted. On Friday nights, the techs would allow us to stay up an extra hour and watch a movie, if we had no complications that week. We decided we were going to watch Insidious, as there was a marathon of the movies playing that night. The little girl went to her room early because she was scared. After we all were in bed, my roommate went into the girls’ room, and jumped on the bed of the 14-year-old roommate of the girl, since she had been saying how scared the movie made her. Just a little joke between them. The little girl started screaming from the next bed over, like a true blood-chilling scream, and I ran into the room to comfort the girl. She balled into my arms and wouldn’t stop screaming/sobbing until around 4am. I was so scared for her. Turns out, she was there because her mother had been “selling” her out to men since the girl was 5 years old, and she through the darkness, she thought one of the men had found her and was going after all of us. She was sent to a long-term child sexual assault facility in another state a week later, and I still think about her a lot and wonder if she’s doing alright now."},{"prompt":"My partner of one month doesn’t like my therapy dog of 10 years.

The main reason being that a shotgun is far more effective. Pistols are defensive weapons (for the most part) that are intended to be concealed, and/or easily portable. There is absolutely no reason to conceal and/or transport a pistol in a home, and a 12 gauge or 20 gauge shotgun is a far better alternative. There are many documented instances of a pistol being fired at close range, and multiple rounds missing their target, and many documented instances of once those rounds impact, the person shot survives well enough to return fire. I assure you that without an exceptionally high level of training, it is exceedingly difficult to intentionally hit a moving target, under stress, and in in low light conditions (READ NEAR IMPOSSIBLE). Give a 20 gauge shotgun with 00 buck, to any man or woman, never having shot a weapon, and from 3 yards, the aggressor is a dead man."},{"prompt":"Why do we need to know what a subspace is in vector algebra?","completion":"Pair (V, R) is Algebraic structure called Vector spacejust if V … is some set of elements v (called vectors)R … is set of rules where both V and R comply vector specific requirements.R may by called Vector algebra.

It is any value from some given Field F.It is not a word game, next conditions expect operation on f values, which only a filed can ensure. The correct statement is that we have Vector space over field F. Example: We often ose vector space over field of real numbers. It causes that vector coordinates are real values. In study of harmonic current we often must work with vector values over field of complex numbers. In other complex cases regarding space rotaions, other scalars may be used, by my imagination."},{"prompt":"Can you do a singing reveal?","completion":"I love singing English (obv) , Japanese, and Korean songs.

They were gorgeous, sweet, and loving dogs. And I loved both of them dearly. But when I got them, I had no idea what I had gotten myself into and I found that out by trial and error over the first two years of their lives. Because of their needs, I would never have another one. Fortunately, we got them when we first got married and did not have children. So we took them jogging every day. Nonetheless, we had to make them “outdoor” dogs because we worked long hours and when closed in the house all day they got stir crazy and claustrophobic. As others have said, they require incredible amounts of patience for training and lots (tons) of exercise. They are bred to run and pull and have the chest and leg muscles to prove it. They love to run, so as soon as they are off lead they take off so that they can run freely. When they run and pull, if you watch them, it is the definition of canine joy. It is seriously abusive to keep them tied up and closed in. During the first few years of their lives, we lived in a major big city. One day they got away from me and ran into the yard of a neighbor about six houses away. The neighbor had a rabbit hutch and rabbits in the backyard and our sweet huskies killed all his baby rabbits. This was the first and only time they did anything like that. The neighbor (justifiably) went insane even though we made significant, adequate monetary reparation. Worse yet, he accused us of keeping undomesticated and wild “wolves” And he wanted us to euthanize them (of course we did not do that.) Shortly thereafter, we moved to Montana—which was a great place for them. They had plenty of room to run. We got a small basket sled for them to pull our young children. I found a woman who did textile work. I gave her the literally garbage bags full of fur when they blew their coats twice a year. She spun it into yarn to use for knitting and weaving. (Yes, they lose that much fur.) Still, no matter how careful we were, occasionally they got away. If they did, they broke for daylight. One day they got away and traveled scores of miles. We know this because I went out looking for them in my truck and the huskies were leaving a trail of irate ranchers behind them because they were chasing cattle and horses! Then, I lost their trail. As the day wore on, on instinct,I started driving up and down the town’s streets looking for them. They had come back into town of their own accord. I found them tied to a fence in someone’s backyard. It was clear the people had every intention of stealing them because the dogs wore collars/tags with our name and phone number on them. They had been gone for most of a day and no one had made any effort to call us. So this is another potential downside to these unique dogs. Because they are so beautiful they are at high risk for being stolen— especially if they go on one of their “walkabouts”. I love the breed dearly. That said, only about less than 1% of the population is equipped to adequately care for these high maintenance dogs. Breeders need to be much more selective about who they permit to adopt these gorgeous animals."},{"prompt":"As a Buddhist, how can I increase my level of compassion without being taken advantage of?","completion":"Reminds me of a fable from our Rishis. There was a Sage who travels on foot everywhere. It is said that a Sadhu that stays and water that stagnates are not both good. So he travels across the country all the time. Once he was crossing the outskirts of a village, and people warned him of a terrible and poisonous snake. The snake appeared before him, and the Sage preached the snake to be compassionate and not trouble people. The snake accepted him as Guru, and obliged. A few months later, the Sage again crossed the same place, and was shocked to see the snake, bleeding and bruised, thin and skinny, weak and pathetic. When he enquired, the snake told, ‘This is how people treated me when they knew I had become compassionate and would not harm them.’ Now the Sage told, ‘I only told you to be compassionate but didn’t tell you to expose it to people’ The snake immediately realised, and from then on, he started hissing at people but never harmed anyone. People too stayed away from harming the snake. As long as you don’t want to satisfy your ego by being accepted and recognized as a compassionate person by people, you can very well take care without being taken advantage of.

In fact, if the amount is over the reportable amounts for anti-money, laundering, they must ask you questions because they’re going to be filing a report about the transaction. But in addition to money, laundering concerns, there are a lot of frauds that lead people to pay in cash, some of these are pure scams, and some of these are people who don’t want a money trail when you pay for work that they’re supposed to do for you. Then, there’s also elder fraud, which is not uncommon. That could be everything from a family member, who is getting someone who’s beginning to lose their mental capacity to handover a lot of cash to someone who is abusing the elder financially, and/or otherwise. I have no problem with the bank, asking about these things. However, I have quite a few friends overseas, and apparently over in England, the bank teller can decide whether or not you get to withdraw your own money. Given that bank, tellers, intelligence, education, and common sense vary greatly, I would not be comfortable with that level of control in the United States."},{"prompt":"Other than cheating, what's the biggest betrayal in a relationship?","completion":"Being dishonest and a liar,I think That about covers everything in betrayal ."},{"prompt":"What is the best one liner you have written?","completion":"The charm of life lies in living to be surprised [LINKED_TEXT: Crossing the Mirage - Passing through Youth] [URL: https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EBnWDwAAQBAJ&dq=crossing%20the%20mirage&source=gbs_navlinks_s] Sensing that she had stolen his heart, she bowed her head as though in guilt.

Six months later Keller is gone and Maggie (wife’s IT) is now 9 and been a momma’s dog her whole life, but not mine. When wife left it was a bit to be single after fifty years, but she lived ten miles away. Six months later Keller is gone, I’m crushed, and Maggie done’t know what’s going on and where is her big brother? In March I recognized not only my depression was only getting worse and Maggie was as well. Once I let my family that I was looking for another dog for a canine companion for me and Maggie and all hell broke lose. It appears that my family thinks I’m too old to need another dog. Anyway I found that my specifics requirements made finding a suitable match for Maggie and me. I even adopted a pound puppy from local shelter. Big mistake, too male dog was described as a 4 y/o neutered male mixed breed weighing about 40 pounds. The neutered male part was correct, he was neutered the week before, he was in fact very sexually motivated. He weighed much closer to 55 pounds of all muscle (primarily Aussie cattle dog mix). He wanted so much to stay but he just wouldn't leave poor Maggie alone. I had him less than a week and the pound took him back. The fact was if I didn’t have Maggie I would have kept him, and I said as much to my daughter that is my wife’s room-mate and from that point on we ceased to be a family. They used to come around and help with chores and all as I own the same home my daughters were raised in, and it comes with a half-acre yard which is pretty labor intensive. Now I am totally alone, but it is because after three months of looking I found the perfect playmate and companion for Maggie and me. She came by way of a local rescue group, as came from a foster situation Not a shelter. The family who had been fostering for six-weeks did a good job, because her history was she was captured feral running with a pack in the CA central valley. She is absolutely a challenge, but Kayda spend first week hiding underneath a shed within my dog run before the previous foster mom came up and helped me coax he into her crate and brought her into the kitchen where she stayed for a week, and her and Maggie began bonding. Now I still need to get a collar on her, but my patience has paid off, and the best part is watching the two. Btw Kadya came from rescue with that name, and because she was replacing Keller I decided to keep the name. She is a sweetheart, and loves Maggie me she knows where the food comes from and is warming up, but on her terms. No more than one hand at a time near her. She loves to be pet and scratched, but don’t bring a second hand. She follows Maggie all over and its full out chasing all over. It’s like an obstacle course made of forty years of accumulated stuff, and trees every dogs dream. I’m retired and nobody to distract me and Kayda will be going for leash walks in no time."},{"prompt":"What do Yankees fans think about Sandy Koufax?","completion":"He retired before I started following baseball.

Once while employed as a Safety Professional and working at a site which focused on the sand blasting/coating of rigs, there was a lot of Air Compressors involved. The senior level management as well as Engineering staff up to foreman level knew the hazards of using/handling compressed air equipment and trained frequently on compressed air safety. The worker level though given frequent training wouldn’t care much as the work load was very high. New recruits were added frequently due to the work load and it was getting difficult to get ample training parted to these. We had three different locations running simultaneously. One afternoon I got a phone call from one of my assistants looking after another site that an incident involving an air-compressor has happened. During the lunch break, after having lunch three workers involved in some horseplay. Two of them caught the third one and forcefully inserted the compressor air hose into his butt and started the compressor. His belly got bloated in no time. He tried to pass of “Gas” but to his dismay the pain started and was unable to move and was about to collapse. The first aid was called upon immediately and they took medical emergency help from the outside hospital. He was rushed to hospital and a surgery was carried out immediately and luckily the person was saved. The whole site and other sites of the company got hold of the news. HR had to run for a couple weeks. Police case was filed. Other serious issues followed. We had to stop the work at the three sites and give a detailed Safety briefing about the incident. Though this started as a laughing stock material among workers, most of them didn’t realize the seriousness of the incident. A strict warning notice was posted in all sites to prevent such horseplay. The three workers sacked from the job. I myself as the Senior Safety guy, told to my fellow workers that if i see any such horseplay in my site, i won’t be waiting to report to the management instead i will personally escort them out of the site as immediate effect and the management won’t even dare to question. Education and Training enforces the Safety culture among the illiterate shop floor workers.

While these are still being used in certain niches the audio engineers working in recording studios, which is what I know best, mostly uses non-destructive Digital Audio Workstations, rather than \\"audio editors\\" - even for most tasks where one would previously use editors. Within the recording studio scene, there are several different popular choices, but Avid Pro Tools still enjoys the position of being the industry standard that all major studios must use/have if they want to be part of the industry where people more than ever go back and forth between locations to record, edit and mix. In that sense, if one were to pick one \\"most popular\\", Pro Tools must be it. But many engineers swear by different DAWs. Still the field is dominated by the old usual suspects: Steinberg Cubase and Nuendo, and Logic (now under Apple) are probably the biggest contenders. Personally I prefer Reaper which has become a very well known alternative over the last few years, not least because of its reasonable price, hassle free trial and registration process and its miniscule size, which IMO kind of makes a mockery of the competition, which looks very bloated in comparison. For this reason it has also become a favorite as many people's \\"other DAW\\" and for live recording rigs with engineers who mainly use other DAWs in the studio."},{"prompt":"Can an employer continue to ask for help once an employee has resigned?","completion":"Don’t know of any law that says they can’t call you but, equally, there is no law that says you have to respond.

If we take physicalist approach where matter is matter and it is independent from our perception of it, than in some objective way, those 2 ships would not be the same because they have different parts. Second way to look at it is structural way. Do they have the same structure? If yes, and only one survived, the other was thrown in the sea, than we have the same object in a structural sense. There is no other object that is more same to the old one than this one with new parts. But if the old one was built on another location again than it has the right to be called the primary object and the other one should be called a copy which has identity of its own. So a copy becomes original when and if the original dies out, or gets destroyed. Third way to look at the problem is subjective way, or narrative way, does the narrative and description of the ship stays the same before and after parts replacement? In this subjective way, it depends from that if a person is consciouss of the change of the parts or not. If the person was not conscious of the change, than the change of parts does not play any difference in the perception from the person of this object. So if a person is not aware of a change, than we can say that for him or her its the same object. Forth way to look at the problem is when the person is consciouss of the change, thats basically our case. In our case, we have to decide based on our preference if we give more weight to the material from which object is made (which changed) or to the structure of it (which did not change). So this question is a question of idenity, what gives idenity to something? In my opinion identity is based on this things: Content of it, from what it is madeIts relationship to other objectsPerception of it from itself if it is conscioussPerception of it from other consciouss beings So, in a case of ship of which all parts got replaced but its structure and relationship to other objects are still the same, we can not answer the question is it the same ship with yes and no, but we have to use fuzzy logic and answer it with how many percents its still the same object and how many percents its the new object. Those percents depends from the observer but also just of the object in case there is no observer."},{"prompt":"Other than cheating, what's the biggest betrayal in a relationship?","completion":"One of the biggest betrayals in a relationship is a breach of trust.

Applied mathematics is the study of mathematical methods and techniques that are applied to solve real-world problems in various fields, such as physics, engineering, biology, economics, and finance. Applied mathematicians use mathematical modeling, analysis, and computation to develop new methods and techniques for solving problems and understanding phenomena in these fields. Some of the areas of applied mathematics include optimization, numerical analysis, probability and statistics, and differential equations. Mathematical physics, on the other hand, is the study of the mathematical foundations of physics and the application of mathematical methods to solve problems in physics. Mathematical physicists use mathematical tools to describe and analyze physical phenomena, such as the behavior of particles, waves, and fields, and to develop new theories and models to explain these phenomena. Some of the areas of mathematical physics include quantum mechanics, relativity theory, statistical mechanics, and classical mechanics. In summary, applied mathematics focuses on using mathematical techniques to solve problems in various fields, while mathematical physics focuses on using mathematical methods to describe and explain physical phenomena."},{"prompt":"With how hard it is being an undocumented immigrant, why not just give them citizenship?","completion":"Better yet, why not deport all of them?"},{"prompt":"w do I transfer a Word document to a PDF?","completion":"PDF files are used to distribute documents as there are a lot of benefits to submit or print your document files into PDF.

Although Russian tanks were decent, they tended to be mis-used, and the German air-support (and attacks) was devestating. Moving 50 miles a day across the longest ‘battle line’ in history was the Nazi direction… initially. The Germans would take top leader Russians (when located, or captured) and shoot them immediately. Many times the Russian troops were flanked, encircled, trapped and taken off to… die in prison camps. But the Germans underestimated the man-power that the Russians had yet to bring to the front from China (much of whom were ‘released when Japan and the Soviets signed a non-aggression pact. Both the Nazi’s and Russia had alignments with Japan). As winter came on, the Germans were very poorly prepared for a ‘Russian’ winter, and they were coming towards Moscow; the thing for Stalin to do was insure they had neither food to eat, or fuel (wood) to burn. In mid November, 1941 an order was given to burn villages in front of the advancing Germans, and withdraw the citizens. Below is temperatures (Celsius) of St.Petersburg; on December 4th, the Moscow temperature dropped to -31 degrees Fahrenheit (-37 degrees Celsius). In this cold weather, Günther von Kluge ordered German Army Group Center to fall to defensive positions. [There is a widely supported Russian theory that navel wars (smoke) in the Baltic brought on record shaking cold weather. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #aapes]]This was the turning point for Hitler’s ambitions, but he didn’t know it yet. Moscow was torn apart already by the German luftwaffe, and ‘wood’ became a fuel for the Muscovite. In contrast to the Germans, the Russians were very prepared for cold-weather field work, and their numbers increased markedly with better ‘focus’ of attacks upon the Germans. If the Germans were to advance, the Russians would fall-off to a predetermined side, regroup, and attack the German flank. The Germans could not sustain a winter night in a ditch with the ease the Russians did. Frostbite of fingers and toes markedly reduced German strength. German vehicles were ‘frozen,’ if not stopped by mud. Soviet prepared winter infantry carried skis along with their rifles. The Germans below were frozen in place.

Pirate crews were run more akin to a democracy, with the crew having equal shares of the treasure and the right to vote on rules and decisions, such as removing a captain. Thus the crew had more of a say in their ship and their fate than in the official navies, where captains had more power over the crew. Also, the pirate captain was expected to grant them victory and riches, and the more he could deliver the more respect he received from the crew. And the more they respected and followed him, the more they enriched themselves. Lastly, pirate captains were expected to be nasty to their enemies, both on and off the ship. Crewmen that attempted a mutiny were expected to be very strictly punished, such as executions or marooning on islands, a slow, painful death for most. And if an enemy crew tried to fight back, the pirate captain would frequently give them the same treatment the Mongols gave to Baghdad: absolutely no mercy. Pirates wanted their victims to give up straight away, so they would spare those that surrendered without a fight, saving their worst treatment for those that fought back. Seeing your captain go berserk on anyone sends a message of “this can happen to you, so NEVER cross me”."},{"prompt":"Can swords cut armor?","completion":"Depends on the armor, the sword, and who is wielding said sword.

The bigger the size of the atom, the less effective this type of overlap becomes compared to the essentially full overlap of a sigma orbital. Thus, given the choice between a secondary pi-bond with the same atom and the formation of another sigma bond with another atom, the tendency to do the latter becomes more likely in the elements below the second period elements."},{"prompt":"Why don't elite soldiers and Navy SEALs have physiques like Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel?","completion":"For the entire 25.5 years of my career as an SF soldier, the most I weighed was 147 lbs at 5′7″ and that was during the second half of my career.

Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","completion":"I am not at 150, I’m around 140 or so. Regardless, I will answer your question. Life is not easier, in fact I find it to be harder. The only advantage I can find is that I can understand things other kids at my age can’t (I am in school so ya). While this can be fun, it acts as a huge disadvantage for a number of reasons. First, school is really, really, really, really, really, really, boring. The teacher is almost always in the subjects I like (math, science, chemistry, physics, aerodynamics) wrong cause they haven’t got a clue about what the Dickens they are teaching. However, even though I know more than they do in specific areas, they can’t seem to appreciate that as I am either too young or something (I will not disclose my age online). I can’t correct them, or do anything beyond their level. Second, you have very little friends, as you are only interested in very specific areas, and most other people are not as avid about it as you are. Even if they are interested in it, chances are, I know way more than they do, and therefore they can’t relate to me. In the case of me, from what I observe and what my peers observe, I have a low EQ, which makes making friends even harder. That being said, stuff I am not interested in, I struggle a lot with (language (writing stories, which school likes to make you do), arts, history).

Or there is something with that name, but it isn’t at all what you see in movies; they just used the word because it sounded cool. ‘Holograms’ come to mind. Pretty much nothing that’s got ‘hologram’ pasted on it as a description actually IS a hologram, from Star Wars to Gorillaz to Tupac. None of them are holograms at all, despite the existence of something called that in real life. I suppose the name “Cheesy-effect-o-gram” was copyrighted. “Nanotechnology” is another one of those things. There are two big categories under nanotechnology. One is nanomaterial science, where really smart people engineer materials that come in very small particles, and when made that way, they have effects you couldn’t get if they were bigger. Self-cleaning glass and engineered antibodies come to mind. Another is “nanorobotics”. Note that “nanomaterials” and “nanorobotics” are totally different. “Nanomaterials” is about things like monomolecular films or amazing tiny structures like an engineered defensin analogue. “Nanorobotics” is about little nanytes - microscopic robots that fly or swim around and have computers in. Another difference is that nanomaterials are real, and nanorobotics isn’t. Nanobots, nanytes, nanorobotics are all TV/movie terms that describe something that doesn’t exist, like an actual holographic image of Tupac. No one has made a nanorobot. A lot of otherwise sane scientists and engineers try to convince themselves that it’s a field of study with some unicorns at the far end a few hundred years from now, and sort of waste their time working on it. Occasionally you’ll see someone going for angel funding from technoMuggles by claiming that their boringly plain nanomaterial design is actually somehow related to nanobots - you see this a lot with medical nanomaterial grad students starting a new business trying to claim their ferromagnetic susceptor junk that’s gathering around a magnet implant in a tumor is actually migrating there actively. But it’s all crap. There are no nanobots. Probably never will BE nanobots. At least not like you see described in the entertainment industry, and likely in any guise at all. There are physics reasons why not. But if you can get funding to try to build one, it’s fun to work on, I suppose. Among the closest things you could get to a real nanobot would be a hunter-killer T cell. It’s got chemotactic sensors, its own power supply, something like manipulators, some amount of propulsion, a fairly complex set of behaviors. However, it does NOT have swarm intelligence, the ability to fly or motorboat upstream in an artery, radio communications, visual sensors or the ability to do unimaginably complex operations like reconstruct dead cells. Or turn into 100 foot tall killer robots, etc. Things that can do this are called ‘plot devices’."},{"prompt":"Who is headless CMS for?","completion":"Cause it’s more intuitive, faster, better, and allows you for smoother and more flexible collaboration.

Even though there are large open bodies of water, the relative humidity remains at about 60% Even as the combustion of fossil fuels (or most organic matter) produces water vapour as well as CO2, this will precipitate rather quickly. One thing why it might concern us in future is that the absolut amout of water in the air is temperature dependent, so we might enter a positive feedback loop, a higher temperature increases the amount of water in the air, which in turn increases the greenhouse effect."},{"prompt":"there any bank PO selected in the UPSC?","completion":"I was selected as a PO in State Bank of India in 1992.

In this, we shall understand the significant difference in these frameworks and which one to choose for your web application development. [LINKED_TEXT: Angular ] [URL: https://angular.io/]is an open-source typescript framework developed by Google. Front end developers use React or Angular frameworks for data manipulation and data presenting efficiently. Angular is an alternative to AngularJS. It is a javascript front end open-source framework. This framework is used for single page[LINKED_TEXT: web applications development] [URL: https://squashapps.com/services/web-app-development] (SPAs). Angularjs changes the static HTML to dynamic HTML. One vital difference between Angular vs AngularJS is AngularJS is JavaScript-based while Angular is TypeScript based. The architecture of Angular vs AngularJS: AngularJS has a model view controller (MVC). The framework acts as a central component to manage data. Angular uses components that are directives with a template. There are two types of directives one is structural directives and another one is attributive. Performance and Speed AngularJs has two-way binding features, with this feature you can develop the application in reduced time and effort. Whereas with better structure Angular framework provides improved performance and speed. Tool support AngularJS depends on third-party tools like WebStorm and IDE. But Angular uses the Command Line Interface (CLI). It will reduce app development time. Mobile Support Both the Angular 2 and 4 features support mobile but AngularJS was not built with mobile support in mind. Advantages and Disadvantages Angular and [LINKED_TEXT: AngularJS ] [URL: https://angularjs.org/]have pros and cons of their own. You can choose the framework depending on your specific requirements. Due to better data binding and Component-based architecture Angular is 5 times faster than Angularjs.AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that is easier and faster to learn.Angular has an independent component and it is self-sufficient and it helps in testing and reusabilityAngularJS provides two-way data binding without the intervention of the developer. So AngularJS has faster and easier data binding.Angular is easier to maintain and scale. Angular apps can be rendered both on browsers and mobile devices.Angular has an inbuilt extension. Developers can easily update the client and server content. And also add an advantage of SEO.Organized and Clean makes AngularJS codes highly reusable.Angular support Lazy load which increase user engagement on the applicationAngular makes cleaner code, better navigation, and high-quality productsAngular components are managed in a very complex way.To use AngularJS developers must be familiar with MVC architecture. Final thoughts Angular is the best alternative for web application development. It is much suitable for building large and complex applications. Google shifted to TypeScript, for better code maintenance and to improve the overall performance of the app. Angular is the framework for the future. Angular is used for enterprise application development."},{"prompt":"Do vocal exercises really help your singing become better?","completion":"Vocal exercises are an important part of a singer's training. Singers benefit from daily vocal exercises in many ways. All voice lessons begin with vocal exercises for good reason. Singing voices emanate from the lungs with the flow of air being controlled by the diaphragm. The air travels through the vocal cords into the mouth over the tongue and teeth and finally through the lips. All of these parts of our bodies are muscles with the exception of the teeth. To control the sound produced so it is on pitch, in rhythm, and enunciated clearly, singers must learn and practice controlling all of these muscles. Vocal cords must gain strength in order to be able to produce musical notes accurately for the required length of time. Additionally, singers must develop lung capacity to be able to complete long musical phrases, reach high notes with ease, and produce enough volume to be heard. The first exercises are to warm up the voice. These can vary. A couple of examples include the syllables \\"ma, mae, me, mo, moo\\" on a single pitch and then working either up or down the scale repeating the process or humming a simple note pattern. You are more likely to be able to match and maintain a pitch properly when humming. Humming causes the throat to widen, the soft palate to lift, and the nasal passages to open. All of these are desirable for singing. The single pitch with alternate vowel sounds starting with an \\"m\\" sound is another exercise which places all the parts of your anatomy in their proper positions for singing. Other exercises will work on different aspects of singing. Production of clear vowel sounds is extremely important when singing. In almost all cases, you will hold the vowel sounds. The consonants are brief sounds on either side of the vowel. Expect to spend the majority of your exercise time on varying progressions of vowel sounds. Lip and tongue placement can be especially important for clarifying the vowel sound and staying on pitch. For instance, the \\"ee\\" sound can easily become sharp in pitch if the mouth shape is too broad. Some exercises are designed to work your diaphragm and make it stronger. An example is \\"Ding, ding, ding\\" worked as staccato notes in a descending scale. Put your hand on your abdomen just at the bottom of your ribcage. You should feel a bounce here as you control the flow of air with your diaphragm. Another group of exercises work through your natural break point between your chest voice and your head voice. This group of exercises is designed to smooth the transition between the full, powerful chest voice and the lighter head voice. An example of this type of exercise is the octave slide either up or down through the scale. Once you've completed a full slide progression based on one note, move up a half step and repeat. Being heard is the goal of singing so there are some exercises designed to help singers project their voices to the balcony seats without injuring their voices. To project a voice is not about volume control which will be addressed next. Voice projection is about sending a voice through space such that a listener can hear it clearly and distinctly. Singing \\"Yah, Yah, Yah, Oooo\\" in a descending scale or yodeling are examples of ways to practice voice projection. Volume control while maintaining pitch is another feature that vocal exercises aim to develop. Holding a vowel sound on a pitch while gradually increasing and then gradually decreasing the volume is an example of this type of exercise. Accurate jumps between pitch intervals is the goal of exercises which involve pitch changes of any interval size. In addition to the exercises which walk the voice up and down the scale, there are exercises which have the voice transition by other intervals; thirds, fifths, and octaves are common. Another class of exercises works on agility of lip, tongue, and soft palate motion. Let's face it, some songs are fast and the words have to tumble out distinctly. The only way to do that is to be able to move the mouth through the required shapes swiftly. All of the exercises listed above help you develop pitch matching and train your ear to hear your voice and accompanying instrument(s). Your body will learn how it feels to produce the sound properly and when you perform, the muscle memory that you have built through the exercises will carry over. A quick note on performance, it is very common for singers to become sharp when they perform. This is because your whole body tightens up including your throat muscles and vocal cords. Tightening produces a sharper pitch. Practice stress reduction techniques and do these within the hour before the performance to reduce the anxiety level. Finally, singing depends on lung capacity. You need tremendous amounts of air to produce the notes in a musical phrase. While daily singing practice will increase your lung capacity, serious singers should also incorporate regular aerobic exercise into their routines. Find an activity you enjoy that makes you breathe hard - running, brisk walking, swimming, aerobics, dance - any of these will have a positive impact on your singing ability.

Take my experience, for instance. I tried so hard to change myself and escape the dreaded friendzone, all so I could marry the girl who put me there. But guess what? She said no! Now, you might think all that effort was a big waste because I didn't get married. But here's the thing: it wasn't a waste at all! I learned so much and gained valuable experience along the way. It helped me understand that sometimes things just don't work out, no matter how hard you try. So, I decided to move on, despite her protests. She wanted to keep me in the friendzone, but I realized my efforts would just be wasted if I stayed. And you know what? That experience actually helped me a lot in my future relationships. Once I accepted the fact that not everything will work out, it was like a magical veil was lifted. I wasn't afraid of failure anymore! Before, I was scared to even go on a date because I thought girls might reject me and all my effort for going dating, would be for nothing. But now, that fear was gone. I went on countless dates, got rejected a bunch of times, rejected a few myself, and eventually found the right one! One girl was totally surprised when I handled her rejection calmly and maturely after our third or fourth date! Later she even came back, but it was too late because I was already engaged to my current better half. Anyways, it's hard to predict which tiny bit of effort will actually lead to results. Think of it like this: you're at a buffet with a hundred different dishes. You have to try out all sorts of flavors and textures, to discover that one dish which blows your taste buds away. Once you find it, savor the deliciousness of that one extraordinary dish and let it bring a smile to your face.

Anything that can be called gun control is an infringement and thus unconstitutional. So any laws passed by enemies of the Constitution must be overturned by the courts. Most intelligent people understand that disarming law abiding citizens while criminals still get guns illegally only endangers everyone. Criminals by definition don’t obey laws. The only affect a law has on them is the penalty part. And the same groups that support gun control want the dangerous criminals back on the street fast, rather than serve the extremely long mandatory sentences for possession of a gun while committing a crime. The only thing that would affect the dangerous armed criminals, this mandatory long minimum sentence, is ALWAYS plea bargained away.

He is of course 100% correct. (That was not the note I wanted to add. That was simply stating the obvious.) When you go to Vegas, you will notice that every casino is filled, FILLED with hundreds, even thousands of slot machines. That is from where the bulk of the gambling profits come. For the most part, the casinos would just as soon not have a single table game in their casinos. However, they know good and well that some people (me for one) will not play a slot machine, for really no other reason than I enjoy gambling for more than just losing money. I like the interaction with other people. I enjoy the camraderie that builds in trying to beat the house (or the dealer). I enjoy getting to know people, and I just like to chat with people I would never gotten to have known. I will admit that, depending on the table game and the slot machine, you can lose money a little slower at tables than at slot machines. Anyway, the casinos have the table games only to get the extra dollars from the smaller percentage of people like me who will only play at tables. If you ask, \\"aren't the casinos happy with the 95% of their profit coming from the slot machines?\\" Of course not, even if everything works out to the casino only getting 1% of its profits from the table, it is 1% they would not have, and you could ask the same question about why Coca-Cola makes odd-ball concoctions of soft drinks when 95% of the profits come from the traditional products. Even an added 1% can mean millions per years. As George said, the casinos have been doing this for a long time, and when a team like his comes in and beats them, the casinos changes the rules, reduce the probability of winning, decrease the payout and make them more difficult games to win, and even play. With all due respect to George and his team, they did more to screw-up the small-time player than all other people combined. I am well past 60 and I have seen the casinos at their glory days when Vegas was run by organized crime. Until his team came in, many casinos still stuck by the traditional values of gambling being a game of risk for both the player and the house. While it would not have had the impact, they could have proven the same ideas in a controlled lab setting, and not ultimately screwed up table games (primarily Blackjack) for everyone on Earth for the rest of time. What their team proved to me was a psychological one; they proved that crooks can hide behind the veil of educational research and intimately, they were only interested in using education, as well as state and federal funds for research, for the sole purpose of monetary gain for themselves, glory for themselves and damn the rest of humanity who still had a number of years, maybe a lot of years, of enjoying the traditional tables games in Vegas. To me, when one person, or a small group of people, for their own gain, makes life harder or worse, or less enjoyable for millions of people, they have committed a reduced form of genocide. Hiding behind a cloak of educational research, and using educational funds to gain the knowledge and information, for the sole goal of personal profit, and personal glory, which results in a reduction to the quality of life is, to me, a hideous act of assault on society and mankind."},{"prompt":"Which is the most unbiased news outlet?","completion":"PBS NewsHour"},{"prompt":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","completion":"There are a few reasons why most Macs are not built with touchscreens: MacOS is not optimized for touch input: MacOS, the operating system that runs on Macs, was not designed with touch input in mind.

Choosing Stocks Based on Your Personality Also, your personality type will play a part in the types of stock you trade. For example, if you are 23 years old, grew up on video games, have a fast mind, and need to have a lot of action to stay focused, then short-term, scalping may be right for you. On the other hand, if you are 65 years old, like to think things through before making a decision then maybe swing trading low volatility stocks might be more appropriate. Whatever decision you make, be sure to think it through. You need to understand that stocks have different levels of volatility and velocity of price movement. By using tools such as Beta, Level I, and Level II information, you should be able to see which is the hare and which is the tortoise. Keep Risk Management in Mind When Picking Stocks Determine what degree of risk you can live with and afford. Focus on creating a stock-picking strategy that is designed to preserve capital and control risk. The most important objective should be to preserve capital. You need to make sure to “stay in the game!” There is a whole spectrum of stocks to trade, each with different levels of volatility, price, and volume characteristics. Start out by minimizing risk. As your skills, experience, and any successes increase, you can consider expanding the risk associated with the stocks you pick to trade. One of the worst mistakes new traders can make is to “just start trading” and “see how it goes.” You need to analyze and calculate, making informed and educated trading decisions. Just like starting or growing a business, a plan is essential. Keep it Simple When You Choose Stocks to Invest In Keep it simple! Whatever stock-picking strategy you decide over the long term, start out by trading just one stock. Watch, study and learn that one stock. Each stock has its own personality and characteristics. You need to understand these “habits” to anticipate the ideal moves to make. Study the charts at numerous time frames - intraday, daily, and weekly. Over time, begin to add one more stock, and then another, and so forth. While you’re trading one stock, it’s okay to study the behavior of a few other stocks and learn their behavior. Once you’ve moved further along the “learning curve,” begin to trade one of the other stocks you’ve been studying. You will already have an understanding of its behavior since you’ve been watching it. Focus on stocks that align with your trading plan and allow for consistency! Do not change your criteria during the trading day – only when the market is closed. Stick with your plan. Changing a plan in the middle of trading will allow you to mentally “cheat” on your plan. This leads to a general breakdown of discipline. Some real-life examples are listed below: Ways to Pick the Best Stocks for Day Trading I will only trade 5 stocks – 1 at a time until comfortablePrice between 150–250The average 30-day volume of between 100–200 sharesMedium degree of volatilityNo high volatility stocksI will see my 5 stocks each night at multiple time framesPerhaps following F&O Ways to Pick Stocks Swing Trading (2 days to 3 weeks) I will pick 50 stocks to trade– 1 at a time until comfortable and I understand this may take a lot of researchPrice above 250Average 30-day volume greater than 500 shares a day25 for Long watch list strong fundamentally (increasing revenues and earnings, high relative strength, in leading sectors)Above 200 moving average perhaps following F&O25 for Short watch list Weak fundamentally (declining revenues and earnings, low relative strength, in weak sectors)Below 200 moving average perhaps following F&OSwing trading combines fundamental and technical analysis in order to catch momentous price movements while avoiding idle times.Retail swing traders often begin their day at 6 am EST to do pre-market research, then work up to potential trades after absorbing the day's financial news and information.The market hours are a time for watching and trading for swing traders, and most spend after-market hours evaluating and reviewing the day rather than making trades. How much you earn on a daily basis is not important. Trading rightly is important in the market. Some trades will surely go wrong and make you lose, but try to minimize your loss and use the stop-loss in every trade."},{"prompt":"Name one thing that made you smile today?","completion":"Sameer is a very highly educated guy who lives in our locality.

I never imagined I would need to use their help as I considered it unethical and reserved for lazy students. I also always focused on doing my studies early enough and finishing my assignments ahead of time. When I got to college, however, things changed. The workload was overwhelming and I still needed to take on some part-time jobs to get upkeep money and pay part of my tuition fees. I still managed to make it work. I was permanently tired, and barely slept some nights but my grades were still thriving. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, however, I was unfortunate to lose one of my sponsors. I lost my scholarship and needed to work full-time plus get a second job to afford my tuition and bills in general. I was on the verge of losing my mind with school, and two jobs totaling close to 18 hours daily which left me barely two hours of sleep, and the rest was spent on my commute. I wanted to drop out of school at some point but the idea of working three low-paying jobs that couldn’t even feed me or afford me a decent apartment was not attractive. My classmate who seemed pretty organized and always ahead on assignments introduced me to her secret: A writing service. I was pretty shocked and against it at first, but the less I slept trying to write my nursing papers after tiring day at work, the more I suffered migraines and depression. She didn't have to approach me a second time. I had researched and found so many scammers online but she recommended [LINKED_TEXT: UKCustomPapers] [URL: http://ukcustompapers.com/] I looked through their website and found many nursing paper samples and the reviews about the service were good.

I like the 100% originality of my essays, papers, and assignments. I also hire a tutor from time to time, especially when I am preparing for finals. This is how I found not only an essay writing service but also an assignment helper, tutoring service provider, project helper, online exam helper and so much more academic help, all in just one website.

Before delving into the study process, it is essential to understand the challenges that lie ahead and determine whether you are aiming for PSUs or prestigious institutions like IIT/IISc. The first step is to thoroughly review the syllabus and divide it into two categories: difficult and easy subjects. Begin with the difficult subjects as they require more time for comprehensive understanding. Simultaneously, allocate time for non-technical subjects to maintain a balanced preparation. Prior to commencing studies, gain a complete understanding of the exam's structure, pattern, subject weightage, and available study materials, including test series. Utilizing previous years' question papers for practice is highly recommended. For study material, consider using resources like notes4u(.in), which offer high-quality handwritten notes and study packages. Craft a study routine that dedicates 8 hours each day to your studies. Allocate 5 hours to technical subjects and 3 hours to non-technical subjects. Stay focused, serious, and adhere diligently to a well-planned study schedule, as it is instrumental in your success. Efficiently manage your time by aiming to complete your preparation at the earliest. Trying to learn and retain everything may not be feasible, so prioritize your studies strategically, focusing on what is essential. Revision is important for countering the retaining problem. As soon as you cover the syllabus, start taking mock exams and thoroughly analyze your performance. Embrace mistakes as part of the learning process but ensure to rectify them promptly to enhance your preparation further. It is crucial to acknowledge that a competitive exam like GATE CSE demands dedication and effort, but with unwavering faith and confidence in yourself, success is within reach."},{"prompt":"What are the best street foods in India?","completion":"Bread pakora is a popular breakfast, tea time snack and a popular street food of india.

Portion control: Pay attention to your portion sizes to avoid overeating. It can be helpful to use smaller plates and bowls and be mindful of your hunger and fullness cues. Choose low-glycemic foods: Opt for foods that have a low glycemic index (GI), as they have a slower impact on blood sugar levels. These include foods like whole grains, legumes, non-starchy vegetables, and most fruits. Limit sugary beverages: Sugary drinks, such as soda and fruit juices, can cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels. Choose water, unsweetened tea, or sugar-free options instead. Regular physical activity: Engage in regular exercise or physical activity, as it helps your body use insulin more effectively and can lower blood sugar levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, such as brisk walking or cycling. Monitor carbohydrate intake: Keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume, as they have the most significant impact on blood sugar levels. Manage stress: Find healthy ways to cope with stress, as it can affect your blood sugar levels. Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or engaging in hobbies that you enjoy. Regularly monitor your blood sugar: If you have diabetes or are at risk of developing it, monitor your blood sugar levels as directed by your healthcare provider.

Everyone is aware that it costs more and achieves worse outcomes than comparable “systems.” The rub is that for the affluent who are able to pay, healthcare in the US probably is the best in the world, or at least close to it. Providers in the US aren’t restricted by government regulations to provide only approved care but can offer all sorts of fancier treatments to their paying patients. There are also no waiting lists for those who can afford to go to the front of the line. The US is also probably still a world leader in medical research and technology. The confusion is therefore between how the “system” operates for most people versus how private providers operate for those affluent enough to pay for it.

I’ve owned cars on and off but for most of my adult life I have not had a car. Of the last 18 years I’ve been sans car for 14 of them. I’ve had a child in tow these last 8 years and have been without a car for 5 of them. One of those years happens to be this past year while living in the East Bay. Owning or not owning a car has always been about convenience for us. If it’s not convenient or useful we don’t have one. We’ve made due with transit, carsharing, bicycles, taxis, Uber/Lyft, and now the multitude of delivery apps available. I have two rules for choosing a place to live car free: Live near a grocery. A big supermarket is a bonus but even if you’re near one or more smaller grocers it can take a lot of pressure/anxiety off of everyday life. Being able to grab milk or a tomato on the way home, even if you don’t need to very often is a big help. Amazon, Instacart, and Postmates all deliver on short notice. Even Safeway delivers.Live near a good transit route. For me, I’m not too particular about it being a bus or rail route. I just want it to be frequent, I want it to run from at least 6am until at least 10pm, and I want it to take me to useful places without having to transfer to a different route. This also needs to be a route that gets me to work. It’s entirely possible to live an easy and convenient life in parts of the Bay Area without a car. In fact, in many parts of San Francisco it’s expensive and inconvenient to try to store a car much less to drive it anywhere. But, as one might expect, you’ll pay a premium (on top of the premium it already costs to live here) for convenience. California has a well known housing shortage that’s particularly acute in the Bay Area. There are many reasons for it and you can read about a few them in one of my other answers here: [LINKED_TEXT: Jim H.'s answer to Will housing in the Bay Area ever go down, or will we have to leave California?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Will-housing-in-the-Bay-Area-ever-go-down-or-will-we-have-to-leave-California/answer/Jim-H-298] One of the main reasons is a combination of NIMBYism and exclusionary zoning. The state legislature is aiming to eliminate some of that with a new bill that would prevent cities from prohibiting dense housing near transit stops (eg, many BART stations are still surrounded by huge parking lots). There’s a really great map at this website below that was made for showing what parts of the Bay Area would be relieved of these controls. It turns out that it’s also a really great visual for seeing the neighborhoods with the best transit. I’ve posted a screenshot of it here but I’m also including the link so you can zoom in and pan around to see the North and South Bay. [LINKED_TEXT: Visualizing Transit-Rich Housing: What Would SB 827 Really Look Like?] [URL: https://transitrichhousing.org/] Everything in green is a 0–5 minute walk from a rail or ferry stop. Everything in blue is a 5–10 minute walk from a rail or ferry stop. Everything in yellow is a 5 minute walk from a bus stop with service every 15 minutes or better. Check the schedules for the rail and ferry stops. Some have regular service all day long, 7 days/week. Others only have rush hour service and don’t run on the weekends. For instance, the Capitol Corridor trains from the Oakland Coliseum up to Sacramento run every hour. From the Coliseum down to San Jose it’s more like every other hour. If you’re set on not having a car I would exclude areas not highlighted on this map. From there start looking for what comes up in your budget. Once you find a place look on google maps for what stores are nearby, maybe poke around on streetview to get a feel for how bike and ped friendly it is - then go check it out in person. Also, FWIW, I live about a mile from BART and live in one of the yellow areas. It works out fine, it’s all about having convenient shopping nearby."},{"prompt":"What is the weirdest object you've ever found?","completion":"I’m not sure I’ve told this story yet… I think I deleted it because I couldn’t find a photograph of the object. I woke up early one morning and looked out of my front window. There was a object sitting on the stairs in front of the gate…about the size of a large puppy. I walked downstairs to investigate. On my doorstep (or close enough) was a hand-carved burlwood hippo. This is close…mine had some age to it, was a different burl, and more detailed and proportionate. [LINKED_TEXT: African wood carving | Wooden hippo carving | Morgan wood | Hippo statue| Hippo carving| Handmade wood carving] [URL: https://www.etsy.com/listing/587376486/african-wood-carving-wooden-hippo?ref=related-2&pro=1] I looked around, but it was early dawn and no one was around. I picked up the hippo (it weighed at least twenty-five pounds) and set it on the newel post. It’s not often someone leaves a beautiful and rare piece of art in front of your house. When I returned from work, the hippo was standing watch; ready to greet me. I picked it up, put it under my arm, and started ringing doorbells. “Is this your hippo?” No one wanted to claim it. I left the hippo on the newel post (away from the sprinklers) and went upstairs to research value and provenance on the internet. I can’t help myself. From my research, I determined that it was African, at least fifty years old, and worth somewhere between 100 and 500. I left it out to stand guard for three more nights. Maybe the owner would come for it? It looked friendly. I grew attached. After three days, I brought it inside. It lived on my mantle for several years. When I finally got my own office, I brought it to work to keep me company. It was too big for my space at my new house. A few years ago, I met someone who collects African art. He loved my hippo, so I gave it to him. It felt like it was going to a good home. It’s not like a giant carved hippo statue is weird in and of itself…but why? Where did it come from? Who leaves stuff like that on someone’s doorstep? What does it mean?"},{"prompt":"Can you ever take out a loan with bad credit?","completion":"Yeah, but you re-e-eally don't want to do that."},{"prompt":"Do US soldiers keep their guns?","completion":"Yes, General Officers carry pistols, in fact they are issued special models of pistol only for General Officers, or they can request them. I have seen many generals carrying their pistols in shoulder holsters \\"in theater\\" of late and it appears to be the in-style thing to do. The practice of issuing special variants or different models of pistol to general officers goes back to at least WWII. The first General Officers' pistols were Colt 1903 Pocket Hamerless models in .32 ACP. Below is one issued to GEN Douglas MacArthur. There were about 2,500 model 1903 Colts issued. In addition, there were about 1,500 of the similar Colt 1908 Pocket Hamerless models issued in .380 ACP. Below is GEN Patton with his model 1908. Although Colt stopped manufacturing parts for both the 1903 and 1908 in 1945, there were enough parts on-hand to continue producing them until 1953. Apparently they Colt Pocket Hamerless models were issued to generals until about 1972. Many generals, like GEN George Marshall, had the pistols finely engraved at some point. Also, as can be seen in the above photograph, GEN Patton had grips with generals' stars added. Interestingly, the General Officers pistols were issued with accoutrements. Beside the pistol there were three magazines, a leather pistol belt with gold plated buckle, one holster for the Colt Pocket Hamerless and one holster for the 1911A1, a dual magazine pouch and a cleaning rod. The next General Officer Pistol was the M15, which was a 1911A1 pistol that was shortened 3/4 of an inch at the muzzle. It was also finished more finely than standard 1911A1's and had different sights. The modifications (shortening, refinishing, sights) were done at Rock Island Arsenal from standard M1911A1 pistols. The M15 was issued from 1972 to 1981. The accoutrements included three magazines, a cleaning rod and cleaning brush, pistol belt, holster and dual magazine pouch. Although the standard 1911A1 was issued from 1981 to 1984 or 1985, the latest General Officer's Pistol is the M9, as seen below. It is also issued with pistol belt, holster, magazines, a cleaning rod and brush and flags (national and general's). The leather belt may now be replaced with a standard belt with a special buckle. Upon issue, the pistols must be accounted for through an automated website on a yearly basis. General Officers are offered the option of [LINKED_TEXT: purchasing their pistols ] [URL: http://www.quartermaster.army.mil/jccoe/Special_Programs_Directorate/Enlisted_Aide_web_documents/Senior_Leaders_Handbook_for_General_Officers_2010.pdf]when they leave the service. The last price I saw referenced was about 500. On a side note, I can remember now seeing generals with leather belts during pass in review, ribbon cuttings, so-on and such-like. I remember having at these times to wear a pistol belt, which usually involved taking my TA-50 off of it. It always seemed asinine to me that we should be made to wear pistol belts without anything attached to them. I remember seeing the leather belt on the general and thinking, \\"What is that maniac doing?\\" Now I know, he was showing off his generals' pistol belt.

Classical paleontologists were not trained in planetary science. Even the Apollo moon program was planned thinking that lunar craters came from volcanoes. There was strong resistance to inviting the Demon of Catastrophe back to the head table. The Deccan Flood Basalts were known. People did not realize that the impact set off worldwide fires. Everything burned to the ground or the water line. The suddenness of the extinction event (hour to years) was not understood. Neither were killing mechanisms. Intense heat and fire followed by darken nuclear winter skies and starvation. A dinosaur impaled by a small piece of red hot ejecta has now been found in North Dakota, but being struck was not the main killing mechanism. Walter Alvarez set out to show that the event was gradual and that the impact horizon represented a large interval of time. Iridium comes down all the time in very fine dust in very tiny amounts. Alvarez intended to use this accumulation as a clock. But the concentration of iridium in the layer is globally far to high to come from just gradual settling of meteor dust. A large impact is required. There was then effort to find the impact crater. Over half of the seafloor has been subducted over the last 66 million years. Not finding crater was not a deal breaker, but the crater is in continental crust where it is available for study."},{"prompt":"What do you think about President Biden's revocation of the Keystone XL Pipeline permit?","completion":"Very stupid, very bad idea, for everyone.

Here are some key considerations to help you make an informed choice: Affordability: Evaluate your current financial situation and determine how much you can comfortably save from your salary each month. Consider your monthly expenses, existing financial obligations, and the amount you can allocate towards saving for a home.Timeframe: Consider the timeframe within which you want to purchase a home. Saving from your salary may take a longer time compared to taking a home loan, which allows you to buy a home sooner and pay for it over a period of time.Interest Rates: Compare the interest rates offered on home loans with the potential returns you could earn on your savings. If the home loan interest rates are low, it may be more advantageous to take a loan and invest your savings elsewhere to potentially earn higher returns.Financial Goals: Assess your broader financial goals and priorities. If you have other financial goals such as retirement planning or investment opportunities that require your savings, it might be more beneficial to take a home loan and allocate your savings towards those goals.Tax Benefits: Explore the tax benefits associated with home loans. In many countries, you may be eligible for tax deductions on the interest paid on home loans. Consider how these tax benefits can impact your overall financial situation.Risk Tolerance: Evaluate your risk tolerance. Taking a home loan involves debt obligations and interest payments, while saving from your salary might provide a more risk-averse approach. Assess your comfort level with debt and the impact it may have on your financial stability.Considering these factors, you can decide whether to opt for a home loan or to cut some amount from salary every month."},{"prompt":"have applied to EPFO SSA.

As an application architect, I would always tell the business users that in IT there is more than one way to do anything. Usually, one has to define your mandatory and nice-to-have requirements and find a product that meets these requirements. ADOBE PHOTOSHOP Without doubt Adobe Photoshop (PS) is the gold standard used by professional photographers throughout the world. But it is very complex to learn and to use. However, you have to know what to change to get the result you want. Its metadata editor (description, location…) and grid photo viewer (Adobe Bridge) is something I use all the time. I probably only use a fraction of its features. The best part of PS is Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) due to its sliders that promote ease of use and experimentation. Adobe Lightroom product is similar to ACR. I have used Photoshop Essentials on my cell phone when I want to fix cell phone photos on a trip. It is very basic and the lack of a grid viewer is a major flaw. One of the requirements is price. Photoshop costs 325 per year for an annual license. When I bought Photoshop CS6 I paid that much for a perpetual license. So I did not upgrade to Adobe Creative Cloud (CC). However, I just bought a new Canon R5 mirrorless camera and CS6 cannot handle its raw files. LUMINAR NEO Currently I have been evaluating Luminar Neo. It’s about 125 for a perpetual license and there are annual subscriptions as well. It has many superb features.

[LINKED_TEXT: Luminating Photos with Luminar NeoIs Adobe Photoshop (PS) the only photo editing software that photographers should use? Has Adobe overpriced PS?

I have just finished reading Mick Wall’s excellent biography ‘When Giants Walked the Earth (pub. 2008, updated 2018). He tracks Jimmy’s career from its beginnings to the present. First as a session player then as the visionary driving force behind Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page was a creative force of nature. Roughly for a decade, right up until the mid seventies, he was genius. The music he created for his band (and it was his band, no one else’s) was brilliantly conceived and extraordinary in its variety - “light and shade”, as he termed it. And yet at the band’s creative peak, right after Physical Graffiti (1975), it all just as remarkably went to sudden shit. There were personal tragedies but Wall’s contention - and I’d agree - is that Page’s heroin addiction had a lot to do with it. That and a degree of creative exhaustion. The two final studio albums that followed were lacklustre compared to their earlier work, and as Jimmy’s drug problem persisted into the eighties there was no new great music - In fact very little new music at all. A couple of albums with a new band (The Firm) and a couple of underwhelming solo albums - the last more than two decades ago. I don’t judge. Addiction is a terrible thing that can take anyone in its grip (I had it twenty years ago). But heroin seems to be the worst drug. It wasn’t only Jimmy Page… Keith Richards too lost much of his ability to create great new songs due to to his drug habit as well. Musical genius (and I think Jimmy Page had it at one point) is impossible to understand. Where does it come from? No one knows but we do know that it can be fleeting, tenuous, and delicate."},{"prompt":"Why is intelligent design opposed by so many scientists?","completion":"Because there is NO evidence."},{"prompt":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","completion":"If the Republican Party, based on what it currently is like, continually controlled Congress, the White House and the Supreme Court for 20 years, assuming they continue on the same path they are on where they continually double-down, let me tell you the story of 2039… The US is a pariah nation, broke, in debt, thuggish and armed with nukes. It looks like a dictatorship in all but name, with President-for-Life Trump having died a few years back in 2034 and handing the reins over to his daughter Ivanka in his will. She was sworn in and held a special gala at the Met right after. The couture was stunning, and I will admit she is still very physically attractive. They starved the State Department of funds and sent off most diplomats into retirement. Foggy Bottom has been waiting for years to see when the Trumps will finally lock the doors. My cousin the diplomat has managed to hang on, but partly that’s because he’s off in India and the Trumps forgot he was there. Social Security was turned into an enormous fund to prop up the stock market in mid-2024, not coincidentally propping up management portfolios for well-connected Republican hedge-fund owners. When I last spoke with my late mother’s portfolio manager, he was yet again telling me how he was only a few million away from the cutoff when they started the shift. Now he can’t keep up. The DJIA is up above 62,000 and humming, despite some other difficult economic factors. Seniors saw their Social Security checks drop by at least a third, but for the leadership it’s OK since some billionaires are getting richer. Medicare was turned into block grants for the states starting in 2022, with Republican states somehow getting more money per person than Democratic states. Obamacare, aka the Affordable Care Act, was repealed that year. Healthcare is now around 25% of our nation’s GDP but we are back down to about 80% of people covered effectively because Medicaid was gutted too. Closing government-funded USDA inspections has probably contributed, as has our vaccination rate having gone down to 88%. And then there’s energy. Between the increase in high-carbon fuel use like coal and oil, and Trump moving to actively block wind and solar power despite them costing about 3 cents less per kilowatt hour, we have lots more asthma and other diseases. This helps fuel our out-of-control healthcare costs. The temperatures have gone up about 3ºF over the past 20 years, or about 1.5ºC. Last year, about 3% of California was blanketed by fire in May through July. Pity about Napa Valley. They’re hoping to rebuild getting good vines from Sweden—France has been heating up too much for its older vintages to stay there. The floodwall that Trump promised Miami was only half-built and somewhere around three times over budget before they stopped, and much of the city I knew from visiting my grandmother during the 1970s through the 1990s is now a few inches underwater, including the entrance to her condo building. Disney World is humming, though—they have new underwater exhibits where you really walk under the sea. Oh, for-profit prisons have been making major bank. They’ve managed to get over 5% of the population behind bars and in camps, where they’ve been stuck doing slave labor due to the 13th Amendment loophole. CCA got the federal contract in 2027 and pushed for federal enforcement of marijuana laws that had been on the books only technically at that point. They scaled back on food, medicine and shelter for prisoners, and after you leave you now have to pay the company for your mostly-nonexistent food, medicine and shelter despite them getting money from the government for your care. I swear they’re charging more than the rent on a two bedroom New York City apartment, per person. We lost our tourists. Oh, we still get some, but mostly foreign right-wingers who want to be able to open-carry a gun for a week before going home and showing the pictures to their friends. Most of them never want to overstay their visas. The ones that do are either very well-connected or get shot and killed for breaking the now-violent-felony law of being illegal. Unless they make it to prison, that is. Our public schools are paying teachers slightly better, but the science classes are showing episodes of The Flintstones—as documentaries. Facts are whatever you can argue and shout in far too many school districts. Many businesses make money depending on how good their patronage is with government. Dedicated public servants still exist, of course, but they’re much harder to find in real life than they are on-screen. My niece has an excellent project in the works at Disney about an intrepid social worker helping some adorable orphans who were adopted from outside the country, who risk deportation because their parents were killed in a freak tornado while visiting the last remaining Florida Key. You should go support her Kickstarter. We no longer have the global reserve currency since Trump trashed the Bretton Woods agreement. Now it’s a battle between the dragon and the phoenix, China and Japan. Our currency is really weak and interest rates are closer to 1979 levels than 2019 levels. I’d love to tell you about this year’s anime, but President Ivanka Trump barred it a few months ago. I hope the trade talks finish quickly. At least with a weak dollar we can export all we want. Only, since we’ve scaled back so much on science and facts and such, our US made goods have gotten shoddier. MADE IN THE USA has become a joke for most goods, with some exceptions for products from the West Coast and the Northeast. Some Republican states have openly talked about putting a The Purge scenario in place, but so far Washington hasn’t allowed it. Support for it seems to be growing in Congress, though. I’ve been writing to my senior senator, Ayanna Pressley, trying to get a firm commitment against. So far I haven’t gotten anything more than form letters from her office, though she is on record as being."},{"prompt":"What are some interesting uses of mercury fulminate?","completion":"Mercury fulminate is an example of an explosive that can be both primary and secondary.

Although that was true there was a few points making it ridiculous: In stead of talking to me he went to HR. That is very weak as he was my line manager. In his shoes (and in fact I have his job now) I would talk to the person myself.He said I was gone for over two hours each time. That was overexaggerated, it was less than 15 minutes because my maximum parking time was only 3 hours and I had to extend it. In fact it is solved now as I have a subscription to a nearby parking garage but even when I was gone, it took me less on a daily basis than many others who take hourly smoking breaks. And when I had my parking place subscribed, I did not even stay away anymore, even skipping lunches to stay behind my desk.Moreover, my boss himself took lunches which took over 3 hours. In addition, he came every day at 9 am and left at 6 pm. I arrived at 9 am and left at 9 pm and furthermore my boss had from time to time his smoking breaks. The guy even dared to say these things to a reciprocal conaissance from outside the company, who then mailed me I should be very careful and I might lose my job. I answered her that this guy has a lot of imagination and that I was surprised the dared talking like that behind my back even to a non-colleague.

It might sound a little bizarre, but that’s how it is. That is the greatest motivator I had in my life. It just gives me so much discipline and motivation, it’s indescribable. That’s not the only reason that keeps me motivated. I’m also quite aware every day that I don’t have a lot of time. Basically, I can’t afford to waste time. With these two thoughts in my mind, I have enough focus, dedication and commitment throughout the day. I’m also trying to remind myself of my goals as much as I can. I always have to know why I am on this path and why am I doing something. Knowing that I have to take care of my family is another big motivator for me. Being aware of what I was able to overcome during this life and how far I came pushes me to continue and never stop.

A smirking Mr Trump wagged his finger at the Russian president and said: \\"Don't meddle in the election, please.\\" The pair were holding talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. It was their first meeting since Robert Mueller concluded his investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia was behind an effort to influence the presidential election with a state-authorised campaign of cyber-attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Special counsel Mueller's report said it had not established that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to influence the election, although it did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justicemeeting of leaders from the countries with the largest and fastest-growing economies - and this year is likely to see differences of opinion over climate change, Iran, protectionism and global trade, as well as a host of bilateral meetings between leaders.

But he was reserved ahead of the G20 talks with his American counterpart, only commenting that the pair had \\"things to discuss\\" published on Friday, he offered his thoughts on both global and domestic politics. He said liberalism was \\"obsolete\\", and praised the rise of populism both in Europe and the US. He also described Mr Trump as a \\"talented person\\" who knew how to relate to voters. \\"It's a great honour to be with President Putin,\\" Mr Trump said at the outset of the talks on Friday. \\"We have a very, very good relationship.\\" On Wednesday, in comments made outside the White House, he refused to disclose what he was planning to discuss with the Russian leader. \\"What I say to him is none of your business,\\" he told reporters, bluntly.

It's interesting to note that some of those waves came about in response to a feeling that music had gotten overproduced and commercial (think The California Sound in the '70s and hair metal in the late '80s), and when it faded, it was replaced by something as commercial (Duran & co in the 80s, boy bands post-Nirvana, Katy Perry et al now).

Here are a few examples: Lying: Being dishonest with your partner, whether it's about big or small things, can erode trust and lead to feelings of betrayal. This can include lying about your whereabouts, finances, or past behaviors.Breaking promises: Making promises to your partner and then not following through can also be a form of betrayal. This can include promising to change a behavior, committing to a future together, or being there for your partner in times of need.Disrespect: Treating your partner with disrespect, whether it's through verbal or physical abuse, can be a serious betrayal. This can also include failing to respect your partner's boundaries or needs.Infidelity: While cheating is a form of betrayal, it's important to note that not all forms of infidelity involve physical intimacy. Emotional infidelity, such as sharing intimate details with someone else or developing a close emotional bond with someone outside of the relationship, can also be a significant betrayal. Ultimately, any behavior that goes against the trust and commitment that are the foundation of a healthy relationship can be a form of betrayal.

However, it is often difficult to prepare such a list because the manufacturers often keep the price under the wraps and preserve them for potential customers only. Coming after the Pagani Huayra, the Pagani Huayra BC is the priciest Pagani car ever made. Named as a tribute to Benny Caiola, a noted Italian investor with probably the best collection of Ferraris and a very close friend of Horacio Pagani, this car is a delight for the lovers of Pagani’s details. Debuting at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, this car has a wider rear track, new sidetracks, and many cool aero features. Like the earlier version, the 6.0 liter V-12 bi-turbo engine of the BC is sourced from AMG and produces 790 horsepower and 811 lb-ft torque. This power is run to the rear wheels through the tripod drive shafts leveraging a 7-speed Xtrac transmission. And the most amazing bit is that the BC takes over the Huayra by changing the model’s standard 150 milliseconds to 75 milliseconds. At 2,685 pounds (1,218 kilograms), the BC also happens to be a lot lighter than the Huayra due to the extensive use of carbon fibers and other lightweight materials. Originally introduced as a concept car in 2013 in memory of a deceased son of the founder of Pininfarina, the legendary Italian design house, only six of these cars have been made as of yet, thus becoming one of the most coveted cars. This is one of the costliest Ferraris ever made and is based on the Ferrari 458 Spider. Each of the handmade units has an all-carbon-fiber frame and is an open-air luxury car with two seats. Like the Ferrari 458, it has no roof, side windows, and windshield, and is 330 pounds lighter than its ancestor. This makes it smarter and quicker, though it has the same naturally-aspirated 4.5 liters F136F V-8 engine, which sends 562 hp to the rear wheels. The renovated interior also comes with a host of interesting details like aerodynamic headrests built directly into the roll cage. The coolest fact about this car though is that the owners of each of the six models were chosen by the manufacturers themselves, making this one of the rarest of the rare invite-only vehicles. While there has been no price announced for this car as of yet, expert estimates place it at around 3.2 million dollars. Built under Andy Palmer, the new president of Aston Martin committed to solvency and relevance with awesome cars, this model is a renovation of the old Aston Martin-Red Bull AM-RB 001. Legend has it that Palmer agreed to this car over a drink with Red Racing’s Adrian Newey and Christian Horner. Newey, renowned aerodynamicist behind Red Bull’s expensive and award-winning sports cars in the Formula 1 tracks, devised an aerodynamic scheme specifically for this car that pushes air via the chassis, resulting in downforce without using the wings. The 6.5 liter, naturally-aspirated V-12 designed specifically for the Cosworth, has a 1:1 power /weight ratio and comes with a Rimac-built hybrid battery system coming with the engine which yields about 1,000 horsepower. As of yet, 150 units of this model have been planned by the company, and the deliveries are expected to start from 2019 onward. In addition, 25 track-only editions have been planned whose prices can only be speculated at present. Upgraded four times since its release in 2005, the Mansory Vivere edition of the Bugatti Veyron is not only among the priciest cars in the world but also one of the fastest. Modeled on the Grand Sport Vitesse Roadster, this German car has an awesome lacquered carbon-fiber body along with a new spoiler package providing new diffusers, a smarter cabin and front grill, larger side scoops, a shortened hood, and the like. The upgraded LED lights are everywhere – the headlight and taillight clusters, the cockpit. And for the aesthetically conscious, maps of history-making events like the Targa Florio race and the like are laser etched into both the upholstered, carbon fiber interior and the exterior. The 8.0-liter W16 engine of the car can produce 1,200 horsepower and 1,106 pound-feet of torque. The original version could reach up to 253 mph and be named the Car of the Decade 2000-2009. The headlights being made of, urm, 240 15-carat diamonds, is the price very surprising? And then there are the LED blades made of 420 15-carat diamonds. And all the gems are customizable. Looking like an armored car with scissor doors and an interior straight out of a sci-fi movie, this featured in the ‘Furious 7′, and has actually been drafted by the Abu Dhabi police for patrol duty! Built by W Motors, based in Lebanon, this is the first Arab supercar. And it doesn’t fare badly when compared with the traditional European biggies. Apart from its awesome looks, the twin-turbo mid-rear mounted 3.8 liter flat-six boxer can produce 780 horsepower through the rear wheels, and a 708 pound-feet of torque. It can do a 62 in a mere 2.8 seconds and can reach speeds up to 240 mph. Not a production car, this is more or less a street-legal version of the track-only McLaren P1 GTR. Converted by the British firm Lanzante, who bought the original P1 built by McLaren, it was made keeping in mind a select group of buyers in the U. S., Japan, U. K., and the UAE. This car has a lot in common with the P1 GTR and the legendary McLaren F1 road car. For example, the gold plating surrounding the engine bay with a 3.8 liter twin-turbo V-8. It is much smarter than the P1 GTR. Not only does it weigh 132 pounds (60 kg0 less than the P1 GTR, but its modified rear wing and enlarged front splitter join with the dive planes to generate 40% increased downforce as compared to the P1 GTR. The awesomeness of aerodynamics can be witnessed where it is made for on track, where it can produce 1000 horsepower. As of yet, only five units have been built, all of them being sold. Built to celebrate the company’s 50th birthday, ‘Veneno’ literally means poison in Spanish, and well, the design does look deadly. Looking almost like an alien space capsule, this car can reach speeds that can give one of those a run for their money, literally. The 6.5 liter V12 with a seven-speed single-clutch ISR automated manual transmission can spin at 8,400 rpm to yield 740 horsepowers and 507 pound-feet of torque, meaning that the car can do 60 mph at 2.9 seconds! The monocoque is heavily inspired by the LP700-4 Aventador and is made of carbon fiber. The sprung portion is placed on the top of a pushrod-actuated suspension, and the total dry weight of this carbon-fiber vehicle is a mere 3,285 pounds, although it is driven by a full all-wheel-drive system. Only 9 units being made, the biggest problem with these cars is their crazy resells rates- one was sold at 11 million! It was the most expensive car in the world ever produced upon its introduction, and only three being available to customers in the first lot, there was a crazy scramble to get hands-on the remaining ones. The most expensive street-legal production car in the world, this is coated with real diamonds. Yes, you read that right. ‘Trevita’ is an abbreviation translating into ‘three whites. The carbon fibers are indeed coated with a diamond dust-impregnated resin, called the Koenigsegg Proprietary Diamond Weave. This technology transformed the fibers from the traditional black to shining, silvery-white, making the bodywork of this car renowned throughout for its unique design and perfection. And that’s not all. Beneath the coating is a 4.8 liter, dual-supercharged V8 having a total output of 1,004 horsepower and 797 pound-feet of torque. This makes it well-equipped at overtaking semis in the freeway. This car comes with a one-of-its-kind dual carbon rear wing, Oconnell exhaust system, airbags, ABS-powered carbon-ceramic brakes, paddle-shift, infotainment system, chronometer instrument cluster, tires monitoring systems along with a hydraulic system. Only three cars of this model had been initially decided upon, before getting reduced to two, because the carbon fiber made it too difficult and time-consuming for regular manufacture. Named after a famous Italian racing track, Huayra Imola’s technical specs have long been shrouded in mystery. The manufacturer has recently released the technical details of the supercar. Mercedes-AMG developed a twin-turbo 6.0-liter V12 engine specifically for Pagani. The engine pumps magnificent 827 horsepower and 811 pound-feet of torque. The seven-speed automatic gearbox makes Imola more powerful than any other car in the Pagani Huayra series. Some of the spectacular features of the car include a large seven-section diffuser, a large roof scoop, more definite side skirts, a shark fin, and integrated spotlights. The gargantuan wing installed at the back of the car makes it look more aggressive. The engineers developed an exclusive paint finish to shed extra weight. They revised the geometry of the design to give ultimate suspension to the car. They installed active dampers along with a front-lift system to keep the car stable under hard acceleration and braking. Huayra Imola also features an improved Brembo brake package and especially designed Pirelli Trofeo R tires. Only five examples of Pagani Huayra Imola would ever be produced. And each is priced at a staggering 5.4 million. Bugatti Divo followed after the immense success of Chiron, however with exotic and much more exclusive specs. As the creators boast, Bugatti Divo is the most agile and dynamic car they’ve ever created. The car generates 456kg downforce at the top speed. The extra drag produced by the aerodynamic elements has reduced the top speed of Divo to 236mhp, 25mph lower than Chiron’s. With 1500 horsepower, Divo accelerates from 0 to 62mph in 2.4 seconds. While Chiron focused on top speed, Divo offers enhanced agility and driving dynamics. The redesigned exhaust system of the car features quad exhaust pipes and a retractable rear wing. To provide an improved downforce, Divo is equipped with a NACA duct on the roof that channels air to the rear of the car. The car also uses improved radiator cooling for the brakes, which is achieved by two vents, one installed on the bonnet and the other on the front wheel arches. Inside the car, the steering wheel is embellished with soft faux suede. The interior also features Alcantara upholstery. To save weight, the storage lockers and center console have been removed. And a carbon-fiber trim has been used throughout the interior. What Divo retains from Chiron is its quad-turbocharged W16 engine. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission has been retained too. Built by a German luxury car manufacturer, Maybach Exelero is known for its peculiar design and price tag of 8 million. Only one model of the car has ever been produced. Maybach Exelero combines the elegance and quality of high-end limousines. The car is powered by a V-12 twin-turbo engine that produces 725 pounds of torque at 2500 RPM. The engine, mounted at sixty degrees, incorporates 12 valves with 3 cylinders each. Exelero boasts a top speed of 218mph and can accelerate from 0 to 62mhp in just 4.4 seconds. The car was commissioned by a tire company that wanted to test its new line of tire family. Needless to say, the tires of Exelero are of magnificent quality. Each tire features a code, specifying its dimensions and limitations. And to prevent the wheels from locking up during braking, the car is equipped with ABS. The interior of the car is embellished with dark and red leather, neoprene, and glossy black carbon fiber. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero was featured in singer Jay-Z’s music video. And the only model of this car is owned by rapper Birdman."},{"prompt":"w did aboriginal people not leave a bigger mark on the Australian landscape despite living here for over 60,000 years?","completion":"It makes no difference how long they were there.

The Borg were first introduced in the Star Trek: The Next Generation series, and they continued to be a recurring threat throughout subsequent series such as Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager. Without giving away too many spoilers, several events led to the Borg no longer being a major threat to the Federation in Star Trek. Here are a few key developments: The Borg suffered significant losses: In various Star Trek episodes and movies, the Federation and other species were able to inflict heavy losses on the Borg, destroying many of their ships and even entire cubes. The Borg were weakened by internal conflict: At times, the Borg collective faced internal conflicts, such as in the Voyager episode \\"Unity,\\" where a group of former Borg drones rebelled against the collective and sought to form their community. The Borg were isolated by trans warp technology: In the Voyager episode \\"Threshold,\\" Tom Paris discovered a way to travel at transwarp speeds, which allowed the crew to bypass Borg territory and escape their grasp. The Borg faced external threats: In the Voyager episode \\"Endgame,\\" the crew used a future version of the ship to travel back in time and launch a successful attack on the Borg, destroying their central hub and severely weakening the collective. Overall, a combination of military victories, internal conflict, and technological advancements all contributed to the decline of the Borg threat in the Star Trek universe. However, it's worth noting that the Borg are still a feared adversary and continue to play a role in various Star Trek stories.

In an unhealthy environment there can be issue of bullying, racial discrimination, abusive people around so the best is to move out to a better environment. I believe quality educational institution will promote and crate awareness against bullying and descrimination etc therefore there's no much stress for students who are living in the college hostel, if any such happens the victim can report to the warden or the director of the hostel and they can take up strict action such as expelled from hostel as well as college"},{"prompt":"Costco dog food good?","completion":"I feed it to all my dogs except for the one that has to have top of the line minimal ingredient blah blah food.

Although I know that you should call a vet first thing). What should I prepare for?","completion":"Steph’s answer is excellent and includes things you will not hear from every dog owner. Not molly coddling is important but at every turn you will be encouraged, by the naïve, to treat this dog like a human child. That is a grave disservice to a dog. You will also hear a lot about socialization. Good socialization only means that the dog doesn’t come unglued when he sees other people and other dogs. It does not mean that the dog needs to wrestle and play with all the dogs he comes into contact with. That’s only puppies’ testing behavior and is not really appropriate at all in a dog over the age of 18 months. In addition to being excessively exciting, they can get injured, even if it was all in fun. Speaking of, if this is a puppy keep in mind that a lot of adult dogs find puppies annoying and they may scare or hurt him if he doesn’t know enough to be quiet and keep his distance. And I’ll drop this on you. There are two kinds of people you will never see at a dog park: trainers and veterinarians. What your dog wants and needs is a predictable, dependable leader. He wants to be the right hand man to a competent, fair and caring leader. He doesn’t want to be bullied when he doesn’t understand what’s being asked and he doesn’t want to live in fear because his person is such a soft doormat that, There’s no way he can protect me because he can’t even stand up to me. Your dog wants you to be the driver, so he can just sit in the backseat and enjoy the scenery until he gets an assignment. And he really wants an assignment. Lastly, walking with him is at least as bonding an activity as feeding and petting. Do it a lot. This may sound like I didn’t answer your question exactly. But the foundation of trust between you is what will allow you to get him to drop something he shouldn’t be eating, to come to you when he’s called so he doesn’t get into a bad spot, and to allow you to examine him intrusively, when there’s a thorn in his ear or a cut on his foot.

I'm in class 11 now (NEET 2023) and started prep a few months back, not feeling like I've studied properly till now.","completion":"Yes, absolutely! It's never too late to restart your NEET preparation, especially when you have ample time to prepare. Class 11 is an ideal time to begin your NEET preparation, and you have plenty of time to cover the syllabus thoroughly. You can start by reviewing the basics and fundamentals of each subject, which will help you understand the advanced topics better. Make a study plan and set achievable goals for each day/week. Ensure that you cover all the topics and subtopics mentioned in the NEET syllabus. Also, take mock tests regularly to assess your preparation level and identify your weak areas. Work on improving your weaker areas while continuing to revise the topics you are strong at. Lastly, stay motivated and focused on your goals. Believe in yourself, stay consistent and determined, and you will surely crack the NEET exam. Good luck! Timetable is an essential aspect of NEET Knockout 2023 by Careers360 as it provides a structured plan and helps students to manage their time effectively.

A timetable helps students to be consistent in their studies by allocating regular study hours for each subject and topic.Reduces Stress: A well-planned timetable reduces the stress and anxiety that comes with NEET preparation.

It is difficult to understand when the stock goes up and down. This simply means that it is not so easy to understand the market. Swing trading is a very popular trading system in the Share Market, which is also called short term trading. If there is any way to earn the most money in the stock market in a short period is Swing Trading. Because with the help of swing trading you can earn more money within a specified time. But for this, you should have complete knowledge of swing trading or else you will not be able to earn money by trading. Here, in this post, you will be able to understand terms easily do that it becomes very easy for you to earn money from swing trading, so let’s get started. Whether you are a student, a businessman, or a housewife, swing trading is a good opportunity for you. When compared with Intraday Trading, swing trading is better as it can be a bit difficult to follow the market due to being engaged in the work during the day. At the same time, holding the position for 3-5 days and making big profits is the fun of swing trading. Swing Trading works on the same principles as Intraday Traders. Let’s see what are the advantages of swing trading? A minimum target of 5–10% is available.Fundamental analysis is not required.The risk from Intraday Trading is also less. Now when there are advantages, there are also disadvantages. The disadvantage is that when you carry on the trade overnight, it is a risk. This means that swing trading is done only when you can hold the risk as well. That is, if the market is up and down at night, then you can withstand it. Because you need to think both good and bad if you have to walk in the market or else you will get stuck. Swing trading is a method in which the Financial Instrument is held for more than one day or two weeks. Swing trading is a way where you try to capture a complete move, due to which the target gets big here. What do you do then? You try to buy at the bottom and try to sell at the top. Now let’s know what is the secret of swing trading? I believe that if you trade with both charts and news together then you will be able to enjoy swing trading. If you trade only on a chart basis then you will do swing trading but you will not be able to take the profits that are there. Like now Path Lab, what was the news? Corona. What was the chart? Combination was. So when both news and charts are found in the swing, then it gives you good profits on the go. And then you play your Trailing Stop Loss. How to make money from swing trading? See it is not easy to earn money, but if you want to know how to make money from swing trading, then you need to know how to choose good stocks in the market for swing trading, which reduces the chances of loss and increases the chance of profit. Wait for the share price to come to a reasonable level.Do not invest all in any one stock.Stay updated with the news of the market.Follow Market Trends.Learn to read stock charts.Strictly follow Stop Loss and Target.Never trade with loan money. These are some of the things that will help you earn money in the market. The market jokes with those who do not understand the market well. How to do swing trading? The Best and First way to do swing trading is News Based Trading. It is considered to be the best way. For example, Path Lab benefited when the news of the testing lab came in Corona & Tata Steel and JSW Steel benefited when the news of the steel company came. Here, one difference i.e., important to understand is that the swing that is traded is either on Breakout or Support and Resistance. You do not get to enjoy swing in the middle of the trade. Secondly, it is a Chart Based on Trading and what will happen in it is demand and supply. Many people do Indicator Based Trading in swing trading. But I believe that if you want to earn money in swing trading, then you should do Chart Based Trading. You will get more money from it. But how? Firstly, one will not be deceived. Because when the indicator runs, the indicator will give you signals only when a move is made in the market, then it will go and initiate buying or selling. But when you trade on-demand supply and support resistance, then you will see buying near support and selling near resistance, then you can pick up the trade from there. How to choose a stock? Like it was also said above, choose the stock wisely based on the news. Track the news of the market. And yes, do not just go with the news. Technical analysis is also necessary along with the news. Only then will you get the benefit. Now if there is a high break or low break of 52 weeks, then we must hit the entry in stock there. Where do you get trading of swings? You will get more at Breakout. When 52 weeks of high break is happening, you will get a buying signal and when 52 weeks is a low break, you will get a selling signal. However, do not work with every company rather only do trade with big companies. The companies you know. Rest you can take help of the screener. Many times it happens that people are unable to book profits or get caught by greed for more. In such a situation, Trailing Stop Loss is the best way. If you are not doing this, you are missing a lot. Swing Trading has many different names such as – Delivery based trading, Short-term trading, Monthly trading, and Positional trading. However, don’t forget that swing trading can lead to both profit and loss."},{"prompt":"it worth buying a (new) Herman Miller Aeron chair?

The big reward I’ve gotten is time. To say that Brave has powerful ad-blocking and tracker-prevention gives a false impression : That Brave is for people who don’t like ads and worry about privacy. Most people grumble about these issues, but speed is what really matters. A second-delay while browsing the web is a huge mental disruption. It’s as if you’re reading a book, flip a page, and the lights go out for one second. Yes, it’s just a second. But you were reading. Caught up in the context of a stream of thought. Ads and trackers slow your browser down. Because they are communicating in this elaborate two-way chatter between your machine and various back-end servers. Brave shuts that down and removes those delays. Here are my stats from 2 weeks of Brave : Brave shows you this whenever you open a new tab. They’re proud of it. With good reason, apparently. 51,000 ads !? Yup. Almost a thousand trackers. Mmhmm. But look at the 44 minutes. You might think 44 minutes over two weeks is nice, sure. Not some epic breakthrough in productivity but impressive enough - now I can watch an extra Black Mirror episode. But you shouldn’t think of it as a single block of time. Rather, break it down into one-second delays. You’re reading a book, flip a page, and the lights go out for a second. Brave prevented 2,800 of those micro-blackouts. Now, the analogy is a bit of a stretch. After all, there is always some delay when you load a new page. So to state it more accurately, we might say that Brave cut the duration of 5,000 of those black-outs in half. No matter how you parse this out, it becomes clear this is a Big Fucking Deal. During the last 2 weeks, I also opted in to Brave’s ad program. Meaning I volunteer to allow Brave to serve up little, tweet-sized ads. These ads don’t interfere with content, they appear above the browser - no graphics, just text. Brave is clever about not pushing your patience with this. It seems to sense when you’re busy. When I’m typing away like I am now, Brave never serves up an ad. It also will take long stretches of time where it shows no ads at all - so much so I have wondered whether my ads are still on. I opted in for ads because of the other reward Brave offers: a cryptocurrency called BAT (Basic Attention Token). In two weeks I accrued about 5 bucks worth. (Most of it was a random direct gift from Brave, which they do occasionally. But some from ad-watching.) My BAT fortune sits in a wallet I can check any time. I can just hold it. Given historical explosions in value for certain cryptocurrencies, no telling how valuable it might become. But I’ll probably use it to tip content-creators. Small operators on YouTube who don’t have millions of subscribers, but who work hard to cover less popular subjects like astronomy. Or who got demonetized for political reasons. That sort of thing. Brave has enrolled many thousands of content-creators thus far (including some major news outlets), but most small-time creators aren’t signed up yet. (For recent stats see [LINKED_TEXT: Monitoring Brave Browser adoption] [URL: https://batgrowth.com/] ) So I’m going to hold these BAT and hand them out as my favorite channels enroll. I must say, being empowered to directly support media that I love, using money I earned by not looking at embedded ads - merely tolerating unobtrusive, occasional ‘ad-tweets’ - feels pretty good. And this post only took about 20 minutes to write. That leaves 24.

Some of these reasons include: Lack of experience or understanding: TDD can be challenging for those who are not familiar with the methodology or who have not used it extensively. Some developers may find it easier to stick to traditional development practices that they are more familiar with.Time constraints: TDD can be a time-consuming process, especially in the beginning stages of development. Some developers may feel that they don't have the time to devote to writing tests before writing the actual code.Over-reliance on testing: Some developers may feel that TDD places too much emphasis on testing, and that this can detract from other important aspects of development, such as design and architecture.Not applicable to all projects: TDD may not be the best approach for all types of projects, such as those that involve complex algorithms or where the requirements are constantly changing.Lack of immediate benefits: The benefits of TDD may not be immediately apparent, and some developers may not see the value in investing time and effort into writing tests before writing code. Overall, while TDD can be a highly effective development methodology, it may not be the best fit for every project or every developer. It's important to consider individual strengths and preferences when deciding whether or not to use TDD in a particular context."},{"prompt":"Why do people spread the fake news that Indian demonetization was a failure?","completion":"If it we're a success then govt would have flooded the media with it's success data .

Kevin Carter was a member of a group called the Bang-Bang Club, a quartet of photographers who chronicled apartheid in South Africa. While he was in Ayod, a village in South Sudan, he came across a child who had collapsed on his way to a feeding center. A vulture can be seen standing behind him. He took this photo which has become infamous because it seems as if the vulture is about to prey upon the child. A very powerful photo indeed. Many assume that after taking this photo, the photographer left the child to become food for this vulture as well as for other scavenging predators. However, Kevin scared the vulture away and the child continued on his way to the feeding center. People who saw this photo did not know this so they criticized Kevin for not coming into the child’s aid. This photo also sparked a debate on when photographers should intervene in situations such as this. Keep in mind that Kevin was told not to initiate any contact with any victims due to the possible spread of diseases. The photo won a Pulitzer Prize, but sadly in July of 1994, Kevin Carter took his own life. It is no secret that the backlash he endured as well as the images that he had seen/photographed all took an impact on his mental health."},{"prompt":"w is Sweden able to send almost no trash to a landfill?","completion":"Thanks for the A2A.

Our recycling stations have special containers for e.g. wood, electronics, paints, batteries… you name it, there’s a bin for it. Whatever is left is sorted into “combustible” and “non-combustible”. Combustible stuff goes to district heating. The rest—about 5% of what was originally discarded—ends up in a landfill. You can do this, too. It’s not rocket science. Trust me on this—I’m a qualified rocket scientist. It does require that people actually behave like responsible adults, of course, and do things that benefit everyone without having to have someone stand and watch over them all the time."},{"prompt":"As a police officer, have you ever responded to a call and once you got there said to yourself, “Nope, not worth it” and just left?","completion":"Once. I pulled up behind a car stopped on the shoulder of the interstate. 5 Hispanic gang banger types standing around it. I ask if they need help. They spoke very little English but they spoke Spanish among themselves. I noticed they kept encircling me. I would step out of their circle and they would encircle me again. Then a guy in the back seat hiding under a blanket appears. Hackles on my neck are standing straight up by now. So… I get back to my squad car and drive away.

It was in the year 2016 when Bipasha Basu had broken many hearts when she had married the man of her life, Karan Singh Grover. From their attires to their happy pictures, everyone saw the magic Karan had cast over our Bong beauty, Bipasha. The rumours of their dating have started when they did their first film together, Bipasha and Karan often share snippets of their life on their Instagram handles. And while we love their pictures, we cannot ignore the fact how much they love each other. Recently, in an interview with the DNA, Karan talked about wife, Bipasha and how his life has changed post marriage for the good. He had stated, \\"Life has a new meaning. It is more beautiful than I could ever imagine. Everything is sorted. She is a master at sorting it down (laughs). Everything is well organised, that’s how a happy life should be. In another interview with SpotboyE, Karan had revealed that who is the boss in his family, and had said, \\"Bipasha, obviously because if the lady is not the boss in your family toh aapka ghar barbaad hone wala hai matlab aapko kuch nahi pata life mein.\\" Coming back to Karan and Bipasha's love story, in an interview, Bipasha had shared, \\"I love Karan because we are like twin souls - we believe in enjoying life like traveling and loving nature. Kahan leke jaogi ye sab - we Indian tend to live like robots, save and die and so are unable to enjoy the money we have earned. It's about the choices you make in life.\\" ADVERTISEMENT In an interview with The Times Of India, Karan and Bipasha had talked about their proposal story, and the actress had said, \\"Well, I believed in marriage, but I never thought I would get married. So when he proposed, my first reaction was, 'What are you telling me?' And.\\" Karan had quickly added, \\"Let me complete the story for you. We were in Koh Samui, it was December 31 and the sky was lit with fireworks. I was carrying the ring with me and something told me that this is the right time. So while she was capturing the fireworks on video, I took the opportunity and gave her the ring.\\" When rakishly handsome TV star Karan Singh Grover made his debut on the big screen, it was alongside the beautiful Bipasha Basu, as fate would have it, sparks flew between these two charismatic personalities—one a Punjabi, the other a Bengali—and by the end of the film shoot, the two had fallen deeply in love. T+L How did you two meet? Bipasha & Karan “We first met for the reading of a film at a hotel in Mumbai,” Bipasha begins. Karan confirms and adds, “As soon as I looked at her, my first reaction was wow, she’s so hot and beautiful. And then you get to know her, and you realise she is crazy!” (Bipasha giggles) “But still a very warm, big-hearted girl; very easy to get along with,” he continues, with a smile. “We hit it off from day one on the set,” says Bipasha. “We would talk all the time in between shots and otherwise, we would eat together, hang out together, and just wouldn’t stop talking.” T+L When did you realise you’re made for each other? Bipasha & Karan “I think our strong bond and deep friendship helped us get together,” confesses Bipasha. “It was a long process—of meeting, not meeting, trying to stay away from each other, living in denial, and all that… a really filmy time. There was no plan in place; I didn’t think about getting married. He surprised me with a beautiful proposal when we took a holiday to Koh Samui to celebrate the New Year. Later, I got to know he had been planning it for a while.” Karan pitches in, “For me, once I realised how much I love her, I knew I was going to ask her sooner or later. There was no doubt about that.” T+L How has life changed after two years of marriage? Bipasha & Karan “I have been living independently since I started working at the age of 15,” answers Bipasha, “So I was used to being by myself, and never missed having a partner.

Is it primarily to learn or to acquire credentials for a future job?","completion":"I personally believe the purpose of a university education SHOULD be to act as a credential to open the door to a better future. A secondary purpose is to expose the student to a variety of information, continuing the education process which began during compulsory schooling. By the time they reach university, students are typically legal adults. They can teach themselves, they have the skills to identify useful materials, read, discuss them with peers and those more knowledgeable than themselves. They don’t need university just to learn. However, the degree they earn from university can be a very useful credential to get jobs they can’t get without that degree. And interviewing for jobs with companies that visit the campus to recruit is one of the lowest friction, highest success rate ways there is to get a decent job, especially at successful large companies. If you want to learn for learning’s sake, do it with a library card, social groups, and by occasionally taking a course at your local college. Attend university if you need the credential, or want to pursue a life in academia. The opportunity cost is just too high to attend university just for kicks, in my opinion. There are exceptions, but they ARE exceptions."},{"prompt":"Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?","completion":"I think the major reason is that you won’t find Kannadiga in large numbers in other parts of India especially out of Southern India. Tamil and Telugu films have been a big draw out of South India.

So the soft power of Karnatka has not been on display much."},{"prompt":"Can you take control of your blood sugar?","completion":"Are you seeking the key to maintaining stable blood sugar levels?

Would you still have to have a priest?","completion":"In France, priests (of any religion) can’t legally marry you. In rural France what normally happens is that the legal marriage ceremony is carried out by the Mayor and, if the couple are religious, they will then walk down or process to the local church where the Priest performs either the old marriage service or a service of blessing.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","completion":"It happened to me. I’m staying anonymous for obvious reasons. A few years back, part of my job required me to travel abroad. I spent 2-3 months home and abroad alternatively for about 2 years. I had a 2-year-old son and a side business which a few friends and I cofounded. I was busy with my day job so my wife helped run the store on my behalf so she spent a lot of time working at the store along with my friends One day, I was abroad and got a phone call from my wife saying she was pregnant again. It was totally unexpected, but soon the happy feeling overcame the vague doubt that I had. Fast forward a few years, I no longer had to travel for work and had 2 little boys that I love dearly. Everybody says my older son is a smaller version of me while the young one doesn't look anything like me, not in the slightest. I never had any suspicion about our biological relationship until one day I found out a conversation between my wife and one of my friend (who was married and had a child. Let's call him Ken) when I was away in which he confessed his affection for her. My wife denied any relationship between them and said that it was only Ken and that she did not reciprocate. I was shocked and could not believe Ken could do that to me, but it was just the beginning. Since then I had had this uneasy feeling. Somehow I knew my wife wasn't telling the truth, but I have no way to find out. As my younger boy growing up, he takes after Ken. I told myself I needed to settle this once and for all. I took DNA tests, twice. And as you can guess the two results confirmed that I was not the biological father. I was lost. Not in my wildest dream can I imagine this would happen to me. I asked my wife to tell me the truth, and with the evidence at hand, she couldn't deny it anymore and admitted to having an affair with my friend when I was gone. My world collapsed. I walked away broken. I wandered for a month here and there thinking about what I did wrong and for what purpose I was living. After I regain my sanity. I called my friend in the calmest way I can to inform him he had a son that he didn't know of and told him I was ready to give him back. Then I called my wife and said I wanted a divorce and everything had been arranged for that to happen the earliest possible. I want revenge. \\"They have to pay for what they did to me.\\" I thought. I fully provided for my wife financially, she had no job and wouldn't be able to support the child alone. Ken, on the other hand, was a successful businessman but he had a family with two daughters and I was sure he wouldn't have the courage to tell his wife about this, and I was right. For almost a year when we were in the middle of the divorce, he never once visited his son nor provided any support for him. I guess he was busy covering things up. I could have easily talked to his wife (we’re also friends) but I refrained. I did not want his innocent kids to be in the same situation as mine, at least not because of me. So we agreed that my older son would stay with me and the younger one would live with his mother after the divorce. My older son is kind of smart. He can take care of himself. He learned the alphabet, colors, and shapes by himself by watching youtube videos when I was gone for business (English is not our mother tongue and we’re living in an English speaking country). The second one is not as smart. He's soft and sentimental. So in a way I was really worried about him. I thought I would feel better after I had my revenge. I did not. When my selfishness died down, I really missed my younger son and the time we were together. I missed the time when he kissed me goodbye before I left for work on the sidewalk every morning and immediately ran to the front window, placed a chair so he could look outside and waved at me as I drove off. If you have children you probably know how that feels. As the divorce was closing (it was complicated because of the nature of our marriage), I dropped by one day to see him. His mother had to find a job, so she did not have the time to take good care of him as when they were living with me. He immediately dashed and hugged me as soon as I showed up at the doorstep. I got a look at him for a long time. He was having a skin disease due to the hygiene of the water where he was living and obviously was not in good shape. That hit me hard to look back and think how cute and healthy he used to be. When he asked \\"Dad, when will you pick me up and return home?\\", I was in tear before I knew it. I spent the night with him that day. In his dream, he was crying: \\"I want my dad. Where's my dad?\\". Suddenly all the memories came back, that moment when I first hold him in my arms on his birthday, all the white nights feeding him and changing explosive diapers while humming songs that do not exist trying to get him to sleep, that moment when he made his first step, all the family outing days when we ran, laughed, kissed and sang… All of those made I realize what was important to me and how bad I was as a father. I had failed my sons miserably. I just need my children to be happy. It didn't matter if he was my biological child or not. Our bond was real and strong. I love him, and he loves me. That's all that matters. I grew up with the blessing and love of my parents. Why did I let my son suffer because of the mistake he didn't make? I cried out loud like a child, it feels good to show your true feelings once in a while… Fast forward a year, we're now together again. I talked to Ken. We agreed the boy is MY son and he had to stay away from him for the rest of his life. The boys are growing fast, happy, and loved. I'm glad I got them in my life. This fatherhood is something I wouldn't trade the world for. I love my sons and still learning to be a good father... Update Thank you all for reading the story of my life and for commenting. I would like to clarify a few things: When I say my younger son was soft and sentimental, I did not mean in a negative way. Imagine you were a parent bear in the wild and you had two cubs. One was strong and smart, the other was not as so. Knowing surviving out there is hard and brutal, you’d probably worry about the latter more and probably would spend more time getting him prepared.As for Ken, I didn’t want to expose him because I couldn’t care less about him. What he was gonna do have nothing to do with me. He also has kids and I don’t want them to be without their parents because of his infidelity. Kids are innocent, I won’t repeat my mistake. Update 2 (and final) Wow, the response to my story was overwhelming so I decided to give some updates:I guess this story is incomplete without talking about my wife. Because of the immigration status, a divorce means separation for all of us so we’re putting that off. My wife and I are staying in the same roof like roommates. I’m helping her get all the trainings necessary for a better job when the situation changes. We’re staying friends and I sincerely hope things turn out better for her. After all, she’s still the mother of my kids and no one is happy to see their mom struggle.For those who called me weak, sucker… I thank you for thinking for me and I appreciate it. I totally understand your rationales. Had this not happened to me, I would have never thought I could do this. But when it’s a reality, you have to deal and learn from it. I’m glad I learned how to forgive and experienced love. You know that cliché saying ”When life gives you lemons, make lemonade”? Well, maybe it’s not very cliché after all."},{"prompt":"What percentage of guys in the gym use steroids?","completion":"We’ve been trying to work this out for some time - and as others have said…it depends on the gym.

What is happening?","completion":"There could be a number of reasons why your rabbit's top of the head has started to lose skin and fur. But I can suggest a few possible explanations for your rabbit's signs: Infestation of mites or other parasites can cause skin irritation, itching, and ultimately fur loss. These microscopic pests can induce dermatitis and cause skin and fur damage in rabbits. A veterinarian can perform a skin scraping or inspect the rabbit to determine the presence of parasites and prescribe necessary therapy.Skin infections brought on by bacteria or fungi can cause sores on the skin as well as the loss of fur. Poor cleanliness, wet living circumstances, or an underlying medical condition are just a few of the causes of these illnesses. To treat the infection, a veterinarian can perform tests and administer the necessary medication.When they are uncomfortable or itchy, rabbits have a tendency to excessively scratch or groom themselves. Overgrooming can result in skin injury and even fur loss. In order to solve the issue, it is crucial to determine what is causing the discomfort or itching in the first place, such as allergies or an underlying medical condition.Skin and hair loss may occur if your rabbit has suffered trauma or injury to the top of its head. Accidents, conflicts with other animals, or other physical issues could be to blame for this. Your rabbit can be examined by a veterinarian to determine the severity of the injury and to administer the proper care. In any situation, speaking with a veterinarian with experience working with rabbits is strongly advised. They'll be able to perform a comprehensive examination, identify the underlying issue, and offer the best course of action for your rabbit's particular condition."},{"prompt":"What is a good gun for home defense?","completion":"Under what I have observed, the best one for home defense is AR-15.

This means that temperature is the cause and CO2 is the effect, not the other way round. Most of the CO2 on the planet is dissolved in seawater. It's solubility in seawater is temperature-dependent. If the temperature rises, CO2 comes out of solution into the atmosphere. If the temperature falls, the CO2 goes back into solution. So that causes temperature changes? Mostly solar activity and the Earth's movement in space. Things we can do nothing about. It seems very unlikely that human-generated CO2 can cause any significant change in global temperatures.

I would assume that soldiers around the World receive some basic instructions on using and maintaining the small arms of their enemies just in case they need to use them. A German I worked with said his paratroop platoon in Tunisia had a few hours of instruction one day for using captured American M1 Garands, 1911 Colt 45 APC and Thompson 45 submachine gun. My Hungarian neighbor that fought on the Eastern Front said their units would scavenge Soviet weapons and ammo off the battlefield to keep on hand when their supply of German ammo ran short so they’d have something to use. The US Army discouraged the use of captured weapons yet still distributed printed illustrated pamphlets about the their designs, capabilities and use, just in case the GI’s had to. Captured German AT guns, mortars and Nebelwerfers were often used against their former owners during an operation until those ran out of ammo before being abandoned."},{"prompt":"You are having a big argument with your spouse.

That weekend I went with my grandparents to clean out the van before it was sent to the dump. It was pretty crushed up an I am surprised my dad survived the crash with very little damage to himself (a scrape on the arm and a gash on his head). My grandmother was the matriarch of the family, a very buttoned down christian woman. She was kind to a fault but there was steel behind the kindness and what she said goes. She refused to believe her baby boy drank, let alone to excess, so the accident, in her mind, was because the roads were slippery. So anyway I'm digging through the wreck for personal items because grandma and grandpa aren't small/limber enough to do it themselves. I find normal things like an atlas, pens and loose change as I dig through the console. Then my fingers wrap around something soft and rubbery at the bottom of the console. I can't look because of the damage (the dash had crumpled almost into the passenger seat and partially covered the console) but its about the size and shape of a flashlight, but floppy. As I yank it free I remember exclaiming, 'What the hell is this?’. I look down and I have a large, very purple penis in my hand. At first the absurdity of the situation turns my brain off. Grandma quickly snatches it away and puts it in her purse saying, 'Thats mine,’ in a matter of fact tone. Grandpa has turned almost the same shade of purple in embarrassment. 'Want, what… Why in the car?’ I ask as Grandpa beat a hasty retreat. 'Do you really want an answer?’ she asked with the barest hint of a smile. 'No ma'am,’ I say, 'anything else I should look out for?’ 'Not unless your Daddy had something.’ We never spoke of it again (at least to each other).

One of my favorite WWII movies is Inglorious Bastards. No real pretext of historical accuracy, just wish-fulfillment Nazi killing. And in that movie the primary antagonist, Hans Landa, the Jew Hunter, was played exquisitely by a German actor, Christoph Waltz. It was one of the best acted roles in the film. Waltz really gave it his all. Why? Certainly not because he holds any sympathy for Nazis, but because he is an actor, a professional, and clearly understands that to really make a hero shine he must be contrasted against a superb villain. Now for a bit of added context, I’m Jewish. My grandfather fled Romania ahead of the Nazis, and quite a few of my family did not make it out in time. But frankly until this question it didn’t occur to me to wonder at the appropriateness of Germans playing Nazis, and having considered it, I’ve dismissed the matter. I’ve been to Germany. I’ve talked to Germans. I’ve seen how they still feel a very personal sense of shame and guilt over what their forebears did, frankly more guilt than I believe they ought to feel. My German friend Marcel was astonished when he realized that I was Jewish yet didn’t hate him. But even if Marcel’s grandfather was himself a Nazi, neither Marcel nor his father are, and they clearly hated Nazis nearly as much as I do. Furthermore, I have done a smidgen of non-professional acting myself, and I have played characters who I reviled. One should never assume an actor holds to the beliefs of the character he plays. And because of all of this, I cannot see a problem with the mere fact of a German playing a Nazi. In point of fact, Waltz’s performance in Inglorious Bastards, as the genially despicable Hans Landa, is how he came to my notice and why I became a fan of him and have sought out other movies just because he was in them. In point of fact one of the things I loved about Waltz’s portrayal was that Landa was not cartoonishly evil. He was polite, meticulous, a consummate professional, and yet applied all of that talent to a job that was utterly horrific. That is how Nazis actually were. The horror of Landa is that he was surprisingly realistic in a film so ridiculous. Nazis were not demons or devils, they were not maniacal mustache twisting dog-kickers doing EVIL for the mere sake of EVIL. They were just men, in some case good men devoted to the well-being of their people, and that purpose twisted in a most horrific fashion. In some cases they were just professionals who followed their orders with Teutonic efficiency, as in the case of Landa. It must have been very uncomfortable for Waltz to portray the character, but having done it I cannot now imagine anyone else doing as well. So yes, I find it perfectly acceptable for a German to play a Nazi, because I do not make the mistake of assuming that such a man is himself a Nazi sympathizer. Original question-Is it acceptable for German actors/actresses to play a role as Nazis in a movie?"},{"prompt":"What are the best freelancing sites?","completion":"As a freelance client, My favourite place is fiverr but for getting started for new freelances i would recommend upwork. fiverr: [LINKED_TEXT: https://bit.ly/3YwA7uA] [URL: https://bit.ly/3YwA7uA]Fiverr: Your Go-To Spot Fiverr holds a special place in your freelancing heart, and for good reason.

Because they are made up of a diverse set of people, and they supply news outlets the world over, they tend to stick to facts, not opinion. If you peruse the content on their websites, you will notice that the style is markedly different than what you are used to. That’s because accurate reporting tends to be a little dull. This is how it should be, especially when it comes to political news. Unfortunately, dull doesn’t make for very good ratings. C-Span is about as much fun as watching paint dry, but anyone with a political opinion should be required to watch it. If you do so and manage to stay awake, you will find that the people we elect, are, by and large, a bunch of selfish idiots. If you are a Liberal, a Conservative, or you belong to the Citizens to harness equal rights for toilet seats, watching c-span will show you just how underrepresented ALL of us are, and what the people representing you are really doing with their time. (My take: In general, their only interest seems to be lining their own pockets and getting re-elected, and doing something they think might give them television exposure, in order to appear like they are being good partisans.) If you think the country is going to hell, don’t blame your neighbors who don’t vote like you do - you have far more in common than you know. Blame these assholes who we elect. Very few actually represent you, and the ones that do get hamstrung by the rest. This is regardless of party or professed ideology.

However, obtaining the call history from the service provider may require a legal process, such as Is it possible to find the call history of a mobile phone number a court order or a warrant.

The probable causes are greed and fear, especially on the part of wealthy white men who do not want to lose any status or power in a world that is changing faster than makes them comfortable. Classic examples of this can be seen in the US right now, with all the talk about clean coal and the need to be oil independent. It is obvious that the days of dependence on coal and petroleum as fuels is coming to an end, but these people want to resists this as much as possible, because they think that change might cost them some money, even though they have more than they will ever need. Their actions, combined with the support of people who think jobs as coal miners, or oilfield workers might be lost, prevents us moving towards these more idealistic worlds, such as the Star Trek world. One thing as a biologist I would like to point out about the Star Trek world is that it seems to have no lifeforms other than humanoids.

I cannot fathom how mind-numbingly easy it would be for everybody on the planet, right now, to just simply give up their prejudices, stop their wars and conflicts, open up their borders more casually and throw everything they have at making the world better than it was before. Sadly, that’s Candyland, not the real world. In the real world, human beings are wired to survive, by any means necessary. Every life lived by every person on Earth is informed by the lives led of their forebears, as well as genetics, history, culture, belief, education (or lack of), experience and deception. Therefore, it would not be so simple for a person living in England to adjust to how a person from China lives. Or Rwanda. Or California. Or Lithuania. Or Argentina. It’s achievable, but not simple. It puzzles me that human beings are so complex yet everything could be so simple. We should redouble our efforts to live life to the fullest and help each other, not hinder. If not, then we deserve extinction. After all… “It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.” “I need your prejudice, your death and your destruction.” Gotta lighten the mood, somehow. Peace and Love.

It assumes that every country started from the same starting point; with honest, law-abiding people but then India somehow become corrupt and the USA remained relatively clean. That is wrong. The history turned out in the reverse direction. Every human is born corrupt. Corruption practically means that you are giving preference to something which is closer to you. It’s not something essentially good or bad, it's just human nature. If you have a limited amount of food, first you are going to fill your stomach and after that, if something is left, you are going to give it to someone else. This is also corruption. It is better to ask how some countries are able to suppress this basic human nature. [LINKED_TEXT: Corruption Perceptions Index 2020] [URL: https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl] has launched recently. Just click on the link and take a look at the countries at the top of the list. What are the common factors amongst them? All those are either country (i) with a small area or small population or both, (ii) or is a developed country. Now for the first case, the explanation goes something like this Small population > Less complex administration > More transparency and easier implementation of laws > less corruption For the second case, it is not clear if development leads to less corruption or less corruption leads to development. India is far away from both of these criteria. Honestly speaking, India is exactly where it should be; somewhere in middle with slowly improving conditions. If someone is wondering, China is only 7 positions ahead, that too with an authoritarian government. Please don’t take it as a justification for corruption in this country. There is this perception going around that people in India are either selfish or stupid and that is why corruption is not decreasing. That’s a very shallow and lazy analysis. If someone really wants to do something about it, start by looking at what others did to overpower this basic human nature. Anyway, USA is really an anomaly in this case. They have 3rd highest population but still, they are in much better rank. It’s not exactly clear to me how but I guess they got a nice starting point after their independence and they took good advantage of that. There is no such starting point for India as it is not a nation-state which came into existence recently but an organically developed civilization dating back at least thousands of years."},{"prompt":"My mom says cigarette smoke can reprogram cells in your airways, causing COPD to hang on after smoking ends.

The Buddha often spoke of compassion – understanding that there is suffering and doing what will best help to alleviate that suffering – as the most beneficial and moral of all behaviors. Knowing that there is dukkha is the strongest incentive for living a life of compassionate behavior toward ourselves as well as toward others. Compassion for ourselves and compassion for others are not mutually exclusive. Progress on the Path to Enlightenment results in our developing progressively purified mental dispositions and behaviors. The Buddha taught that developing wisdom and compassion is essential if one is to find enlightenment. Moreover, like two wings that work together in flight, each of these qualities supports the other. Wisdom distinguishes beneficial from non-beneficial, while compassion moves us to action.In modern terms, in his discussions of these two attributes, the Buddha was basically speaking of empathy for another’s suffering and the desire to alleviate it. Empathy both precedes compassion and is a prerequisite for compassion. Fundamentally, to have empathy is to understand another’s feelings. It is to put ourselves emotionally in the place of another. The ability to empathize, however, depends on our capability to feel our own feelings and identify them, because to recognize them in others we need to be able to recognize them in ourselves. To play with the clichés that capture this notion, empathy is walking in another’s shoes or hearing with someone else’s ears. We can understand the common connotation of empathy in this way."},{"prompt":"Why are Tempurpedic beds so expensive?","completion":"A mattress is designed, in a rectangular pad for supporting a lying person, it plays the role of bed or on a bed frame as part of a bed.

This one captured a girl in the background, with whom the sailor was actually out on a date that day. She did go on to become his wife later and her name is Rita Mendonsa. Image source : [LINKED_TEXT: VJday Times Square Kiss] [URL: http://www.famouspictures.org/vjday-times-square-kiss/] Second, the pair who are actually kissing in the photograph, George Mendonsa and Greta Zimmer, did not know each other. The actual story behind the photo is as romantic as a cabbage: George was all set to leave for the war again and was on a date with a girl with whom he later said he had fallen in love at the first sight. They were watching a show when they learned the war was over. So leaving the show in the middle, they went out on the streets where people had begun preliminary celebrations. George got buzzed after having one too many drinks. Now, George highly respected the nurses he had seen in the war. Obviously, because they treated the injured soldiers and helped them get back on their feet. He then sees this girl - Greta, in a nurse's uniform. Alcohol and reverence for the nurses takes over and promptly forgetting his love at first sight Rita, he moves away and grabs Greta- the nurse and plants his iconic kiss on her unaware self. Greta was obviously not amused and tried to get out of his grasp but it was over as quickly as it had begun. And get this, Greta was not actually a nurse. She was wearing her dental assistant uniform and had walked to the square to confirm if the news was true. Anyway, long story short, George and Rita end up marrying and Rita was never really bothered by the photo as George was all tipsy and they weren't even engaged at that point. I do however feel that the photo did capture the happiness which came with the end of the second world war - if you look around the pair, happiness is beaming everywhere in the background. The grabbing someone forcefully part is not cool though. And that's why I feel this is a misunderstood photo as the spotlight has always been on George and Greta.

How on earth did Tesla manage to pull this off, while other companies including Google have been trying to do it for years?","completion":"Tesla hasn’t “pulled anything off”. I assume you mean the “Full Self Driving” version of Autopilot, which sounds like it could be a driver-less car solution that could do the same things as Waymo but is not. Let’s look at the [LINKED_TEXT: Tesla Website descriptions] [URL: https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot#usingautopilot] for their Autopilot capabilities: Autopilot Autopilot includes the following functionality and features: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control: Matches the speed of your car to that of the surrounding trafficAutosteer: Assists in steering within a clearly marked lane, and uses traffic-aware cruise control Enhanced Autopilot In addition to the functionality and features of Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot also includes: Navigate on Autopilot: Actively guides your car from a highway’s on-ramp to off-ramp, including suggesting lane changes, navigating interchanges, automatically engaging the turn signal and taking the correct exit.Auto Lane Change: Assists in moving to an adjacent lane on the highway when Autosteer is engaged.Autopark: Helps automatically parallel or perpendicular park your car, with a single touch.Summon: Moves your car in and out of a tight space using the mobile app or key.Smart Summon: Your car will navigate more complex environments and parking spaces, maneuvering around objects as necessary to come find you in a parking lot. Full Self-Driving Capability In addition to the functionality and features of Autopilot and Enhanced Autopilot, Full Self-Driving Capability also includes: Traffic and Stop Sign Control (Beta): Identifies stop signs and traffic lights and automatically slows your car to a stop on approach, with your active supervision Upcoming: Autosteer on city streets First note the caveat about “with your active supervision” — this immediately puts the lie to the term “full self driving”. This terminology, even above and beyond the already-misleading term “autopilot”, is one of the more brazen marketing ploys in automotive history. Then note that the main thing that Waymo does — steering itself around the city — isn’t even in Beta yet at Tesla. The fact that this is a single short line at the bottom of the list makes it seem like a minor improvement, it’s not: it’s an order of magnitude harder than almost anything else on that list. [LINKED_TEXT: Steve Baker] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Steve-Baker-100] notes the extensive array of Lidar and other sensors used by the Waymo cars, and that’s kind of the point. Current Tesla designs currently don’t have the sensory capability to safely do urban driving; they try to make up for it with software but you can’t extrapolate from data that’s not there. The Tesla “cheat” of requiring frequent driver input on the steering wheel (to validate that they are providing “active supervision”) doesn’t even make sense in an urban-driving scenario where there is constant and significant steering action throughout the process. So Tesla has not “pulled off” anything in the area that Waymo is working on. None of this is to say that Teslas are bad cars. The two companies are approaching the same overall problem set (complete, “real” autonomy) from two different directions — Tesla is taking what works today (e.g. advanced autopilot capabilities), adding some additional sensors and software and coming up with an impressive set of capabilities, but leaving the really hard nuts (such as urban driving) for last/for others. Waymo is starting with the hardest use cases and making sure they are starting with more than enough sensors to make it work, and applying off-line mapping and AI techniques that Tesla’s hardware and software can’t do. From there the rest of it (highway driving etc.) becomes trivial and the trick will be to manage costs (e.g. find the minimal required hardware set to do the job). Moreover, the experimental taxis are test/prototype vehicles and in no way are in competition with Tesla as a product. I don’t think Waymo has any real plans to become a car company at all. Eventually what Waymo learns will make its way into many cars, potentially including Teslas, and we will have the best of both worlds."},{"prompt":"it possible to have an English accent if you are not white?","completion":"Of course not.

They asked my to send a CV and a photo ; I remember wondering why the photo would ever matter. Remember: IT guy, mostly spending his days in front of a computer, rarely expected to communicate with humans, but ok, sure, why not. The recruitment agent called. She sounded like someone in her 50s, self-confident, and seemed to know what she was looking for (she at least knew there was a difference between Java and Javascript, which is less common than one thinks) . But then she blew my mind: Her: that’s your picture? hmm. This might be a problem. How much do you care about your long hair? Me: not all that much, but why would that matter? Her: they might not be ok with it, so I recommend you cut your hair short. Me: again, I never cared much about my hair, but may I ask what problem one could potentially have with me having long hair? As far as I know, I would be nowhere close to dangerous machinery: this is an insurance company and I work with computers. Her: you don’t understand. These are serious people. They expect serious employees. They will not be ok with your long hair. Now, I remember having watched that episode from whateverwasit where one young guy is told to cut hair, remove piercings and hide tattoos in order to get a job. But he was a sales guy in a shop. He would meet customer all the time, and needed to “please to eye of everybody” or something like that. I remember this episode of whateverthatonewas where the “cut your hair” line was a test to see of much one wanted the job. He did cut the hair and did not get the job. That’s humiliating alright.

One holds that life begins at the moment of conception and anything that ends a pregnancy is equivalent to killing a human being. The other side is against any limit on abortion, period. The most extreme of these hold that the mother should be able to decide for a short time AFTER birth. Even the more moderate of these insist that it be called a “fetus” instead of “unborn baby”. There is no room for compromise between these two positions. Each can point to science to support their positions. It doesn’t help that motherhood is looked on with disrespect. Feminists believe that a woman’s proper place is working rather than raising children. And, some women depend on abortion as birth control. And the anti-abotion position is endorsed by Catholics and Evangelicals. That makes it easy to dismiss their side as trying to push their religion. What brought this to a head was a law limiting abortion to the first 15 weeks. That’s fairly liberal by European standards where 12 weeks is the norm but the pro-abortion side considered it unacceptable and sued to have it overturned.

He knows how much our bills are and when they are due. He helps with bedtime and teaching our daughter things and playing with her and her general care. He’s cooked dinner before, though he needed quite a bit of guidance. He cleans, he does the yard, he spends time with us, and he still gets his alone time to play video games or whatever he chooses to spend his time on. He’s an employee, a husband, a father, a man, and an individual, and he gives time and attention to each of those roles, just as I am an employee, a wife, a mother, and an individual, and I give time and attention to each of my roles. We are partners in everything. There are weeks where I don’t do much housework. Either I’m not feeling well or I just need a break from it all, and I know I can take that time to mentally checkout from an area or two, because my husband has my back. And he can and has done the same. Because I’m there to pick up the slack while he does what he needs to. We’re human and that’s how we care for ourselves. We leave the dishes for a day so we can spend an extra hour with our kid, and still have some alone time. For example, anyway. This is what works for us. I know several people who have a more clear cut division of labor and what each person’s role is, and what responsibilities each have. I know people who treat chores and money and all of that as if they were roommates. It’s almost businesslike. But it works for them, so great.

It works for us, and I feel like it’s made us happier, healthier people because of it."},{"prompt":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","completion":"This is a conversation I have been having with my son. I have a long standing habit of eating once a day. Probably been doing so for around 35 years. I started the habit as a young man, when i would work summers doing hard physical labor. I simply didn’t feel like eating while I was hot and sweaty. When I ate in the morning and immediately started working, I would get queasy. So, I ate my full at dinner and was satisfied. I didn’t suffer from hunger pangs. I was drinking enough water to always have something in my stomach. I would use lunch time to read or take a dip in the water (I am on the Chesapeake Bay). I think people have confused being hungry with the impulse towards habitual eating. It takes 18 hours or so before my stomach starts growling. I do not feel the urge towards snacking, as it was never my habit. My stomach growls, I drink some water to stay hydrated, and I no longer feel hungry. Before dinner, my stomach will growl even with water in it. I sometimes feel hungry when I wake, but it goes away with my first cup of coffee or drink of juice. I know in advance if I eat, I will invariably feel nauseous or uncomfortable. However, when I was younger, for a while I was consuming a lot of sugar. The sugar gave me cravings which could be confused for appetite. I found myself consuming more and more sugary things, until I started feeling addicted and cut back down. Considering the daily nutritional requirement for most people, it is an easy thing to consume a days food in one meal, while still getting everything you need. By doing so, you can avoid a lot of problems caused by overindulging and eating too many preserved foods. It’s a LOT easier to be able to afford eating healthy if you are eating appropriately sized portions. Instead of feeding on cheap volume throughout the day; eat a full, nutritious meal once a day and thoroughly enjoy the food you prepare. I have seen people giving their child snacks to distract them or keep them quiet. I think this is a habit that continues through life. I’m a Generation X latch key kid, and I did not come home for lunch as a kid. I had a neighborhood to run. :) I never formed the habit of three meals a day. I thought my friends were preoccupied with food and didn’t really understand. Now that I am in my 50s, even eating once a day I have to be careful not to put on weight. The food in the stores now will put weight on you just walking past it. So much sugar and so many preservatives. Get to be friends with the grocery store clerk who refills the veggie section in the grocery store, and enjoy the best fruits and veggies available to you, then look around for a grass fed organic beef wholesaler and buy a freezer. Eat real food, once a day, in appropriate portions, supplement for trace minerals and the most important vitamins, and disappoint your doctor regularly when you don’t need all the pills everyone else seems to need. Eating the right amount and quality of food, is something you do for YOU. That craving is a heart condition later, so ignore the heck out of it, until it ceases to bother you. Because it will eventually not bother you to ‘skip’ meals that only caused you difficulty to start with. You will feel lighter, more active, more energetic, and you will sleep like a log at night. People do not realize how much food they are carrying in their colon. It’s literally pounds of food being processed as you walk around. You must have an almost empty digestive system to identify which foods cause you digestive difficulties. With a few pounds of yesterdays foods still moving through you, one can only make guesses. Most everything you complain about in your life is probably connected to your diet, and you just don’t realize it yet. We were taught as kids in the 70s that ‘You are what you eat’ and I took it to heart and proved it. I enjoy food more than most people. I put more thought into what my dinner will be than most people. I spend a few extra minutes getting the best quality I can afford. And I am usually salivating as I put it on the table. I enjoy eating, rather than feeling any guilt whatsoever. Other people are munching chips during the day, I am plotting and planning what I will do to leftovers of that shoulder roast I made the other day. It’s a mindset. It would take you weeks to starve to death. Missing a few of the meals everyone seems intent on eating, regardless of need, will only do you good. Embrace the newfound awareness of how your body reacts when you eat when you are TRULY hungry. It’s satisfying in a unique way. When every night you are thinking ‘That may have been my best dinner yet!”, because you are truly enjoying and appreciating the food you serve yourself. Adjusting your eating habits shouldn’t feel like a chore. It’s a gift you give yourself. If other people do not understand, let them witness the results. You don’t have to say a word to defend yourself. They wouldn’t believe you anyway - they are creatures of habit."},{"prompt":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","completion":"No like why would i be upset?

It's important to nourish your body with a variety of delicious and healthy foods. Fill your plate with colorful fruits and vegetables, lean proteins like chicken or fish, and whole grains such as brown rice or quinoa. These choices provide essential nutrients and can help keep your blood sugar stable.Remember that portion control plays a significant role. It's not about depriving yourself but rather enjoying your favorite foods in moderation. By paying attention to portion sizes, you can savor the flavors you love while keeping your blood sugar levels in check.I encourage you to explore low glycemic index (GI) foods. These include foods like sweet potatoes, lentils, and leafy greens. They are digested more slowly, causing a gradual rise in blood sugar instead of sudden spikes. Incorporating these foods into your meals can help you maintain more stable blood sugar levels throughout the day.Let's make a conscious effort to reduce sugary beverages in your routine. Swap out sodas or sugary juices for refreshing options like infused water, unsweetened tea, or sparkling water with a slice of lemon or cucumber. By cutting back on sugary drinks, you can better manage your blood sugar and promote overall health.Fiber is your friend when it comes to blood sugar control. Incorporate high-fiber foods into your diet, such as whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and legumes. Fiber slows down the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream, helping to prevent sharp spikes and maintaining a more balanced blood sugar level.Let's get moving! Regular physical activity not only helps manage blood sugar levels but also improves your overall well-being. Find activities you enjoy, whether it's taking a brisk walk, dancing, swimming, or playing a sport. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week, and remember to include strength training exercises to keep your body strong.Managing stress is an essential part of maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Find activities that help you relax and unwind, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or pursuing hobbies that bring you joy. Taking care of your mental and emotional well-being can positively impact your blood sugar control.Prioritize a good night's sleep. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Lack of sleep can disrupt your body's insulin sensitivity and affect your blood sugar levels. Establish a relaxing bedtime routine and create a comfortable sleep environment to promote restful sleep.If you have diabetes, closely monitoring your carbohydrate intake can be beneficial. Work with a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, who can help you determine the right amount of carbohydrates to include in your meals and snacks.Lastly, always follow your healthcare provider's instructions regarding medications and treatments for blood sugar control. They are there to support you and provide guidance specific to your needs. Personal recommendation : [LINKED_TEXT: Ground-breaking Blood Sugar and Sleep Support] [URL: https://0e8757q76vfva5ufmhsbwg3-46.hop.clickbank.net/] Remember, you're not alone on this journey.

Why or why not?","completion":"We are all parts of a single system called nature. Because we exist in a single system, our actions and even our thoughts influence each other, either positively or negatively. By relating to others unfavorably we actually invite upon ourselves certain pressures from nature (COVID-19) that come to shake us up and show us that we are not in balance with the general law of homeostasis. But when we relate to each other like in a family, where each one cares for the well-being of the other, then by this we can all be well off and receive everything we need in life. It follows that the well-being of the individual is inherently linked to the well-being of those around him. Nature’s law is unbending. It doesn’t take our feelings into consideration. It is a law and that law must always remain balanced. We would be wise to learn about this law as it directly impacts our day to day life. The rest of the parts of nature (i.e. the still, vegetative, and animate degrees) already exists in balance with this single law of homeostasis. Only human beings must learn to live in balance with nature through our own education. This is the call of the times and what distinguishes us from previous generations. So let's treat each other with kindness and consideration and life will be good! Even thinking of this is already a huge step in the right direction."},{"prompt":"Who is a better Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi or Manmohan Singh?","completion":"Manmohan Singh"},{"prompt":"Can Onigashima Luffy beat Blackbeard?","completion":"Hard to say Oda hasn’t given us any clear indication of Blackbeard’s strength On one hand the man managed to capture two insanely powerful devil fruits He easily killed a Yonko’s commander (although in a sneak attack) And he easily defeated the powerful Whitebeard remnants. He was strong enough that Ace feared his neck was going to break during their fight At one point, he scarred Shanks, and Shanks seems to take him very seriously Emperor Im, the leader of the WG, had his wanted poster and tore it apart. In the mind of the leader of the entire world, Blackbeard is as dangerous as a fishwoman who can easily destroy Islands, and a Rubber boy with the potential to become Pirate King. Luffy always loses to his tough opponents initially, from a writing standpoint, Oda knows he needs to deliver. I personally expect nothing from Blackbeard. But a lot of OP fans seem to think he’ll be the greatest villain in the series. Oda has also gone of out his way to foreshadow their eventual fight. Essentially, there’s no fucking way Oda would let Luffy beat Blackebard in a single fight. Looking at what we have, I’d say Luffy has a decent chance. But, still, I’d be shocked if Oda didn’t have Luffy lose at least twice to Blackbeard. The greatest villain in a series full of great villains can’t be taken down so easily. Other the other hand His entire crew was one-shotted by Magellan. Surprise or not, the Warden could’ve killed Blackbeard’s entire crew right there and then. He is also sneaky. Relying on underhanded tactics as opposed to straight out battle, this would hurt someone like Luffy who isn’t very smart. ( But maybe Sanji can shine as a strategist and overcome that) This is reflected in his crew, like Siryuu who chose to eat the Invisible fruit. As a swordsman, you’d think he’d have more pride than to rely on cheap tactics like that. But Blackbeard doesn’t care how you win. I could 100% see a scenario where Blackbeard tries to gang up on Luffy, similar to what he did with Whitebeard. With his entire post-timeskip crew present, he ran from Akainu who was by himself. Killing Akainu would significantly raise his fame and remove one of his biggest threats. There are a few reasons he could’ve chosen to run, but I think the pros outweigh the cons. Leading me to believe that Blackbeard didn’t consider his entire crew to be capable of beating a single Admiral. He hasn’t shown any haki mastery While he was strong enough to beat Ace and presumably Marco. Blackbeard’s main advantage is his ability to negate devil fruit using the dark fruit. People like Ace and Marco are more or less fodder without their fruits. Luffy has spent the entirety of the post timeskip time honing his haki skills. He relies on his devil fruit, but not nearly as much as Ace and Marco did. Even if you took his df away, current Luffy is still an extremely powerful force. Oda has gone out of his way to show the weakness of Blackbeard and the Blackbeard Pirates. Kaido was supposed to be the pinnacle of strength, merely cutting the guy was a huge accomplishment. Whitebeard was so fearsome that the WG had to bring out everything they had just to face him. Blackbeard has none of that. He’s been shown to be a coward, incompetent at times, weak, relying heavily on others, the dude only has a bounty of 2 billion. List of Points Pro Blackbeard: Two powerful dfs, killed a Yonko commander, has intense physical strength, Shanks considers him a threat, the leader of the WG consider him to be a threat, he’s been hyped up as Luffy’s main antagonist Cons: Does not possess a strong will, has a seemingly weak crew, uses underhanded tactics, has only beaten foolish devil fruit users, no extreme haki skill shown, Oda has shown him as a fool multiple times, doesn’t have the feats of the other Yonkos. Summary Sorry, for the long response the shortest answer to your question is that Oda will almost certainly have Luffy lose to Blackbeard. In the world of OP, it doesn't entirely match up. But OP is a story with trends and expectations and Oda tends to follow his trends and surpass expecations. So Blackbeard has to defeat Luffy, at least twice, maybe maybe only once."},{"prompt":"it safe to apply aloe vera gel on the face overnight?","completion":"Yes, it is generally safe to apply aloe vera gel on the face overnight. Aloe vera gel is a natural and gentle ingredient that is widely used in skincare products due to its numerous health benefits for the skin. Aloe vera gel contains a high concentration of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that can help moisturize and soothe the skin, reduce inflammation, and promote healing. Applying aloe vera gel on the face overnight can help hydrate and nourish the skin while you sleep, leaving it looking refreshed and rejuvenated in the morning. However, it is important to note that some people may be allergic to aloe vera gel, so it is recommended to do a patch test before applying it to your entire face. To do a patch test, apply a small amount of aloe vera gel to a small area of your skin and wait for 24 hours to see if you experience any adverse reactions, such as redness or itching. Additionally, it is recommended to use pure aloe vera gel that does not contain any added fragrances or chemicals that can irritate the skin. If you have sensitive skin or are concerned about applying aloe vera gel overnight, it is best to consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional before use."},{"prompt":"Were female relatives of a new Ottoman sultan also at risk of being killed following a new ascension?","completion":"No. Women were never in the line of succession and as such were not “threats” for a new sultan seeking to cement his authority."},{"prompt":"Which is a better band: Iron Maiden or Judas Priest?","completion":"In the end, it all comes down to preference. This question is like asking “What do you prefer, tea or coffee?” One might have a preference for tea, other might have a preference for coffee, and some, like me, prefer both tea and coffee. Needless to say, both the bands are the most important and influential bands in the history of not just Heavy Metal alone, but the history of entire music. Both of them are unique on their own, but have equally influenced and left a legacy in Heavy Metal. Let’s talk about Judas Priest first. Why is Judas Priest important? Well, they were the first to revolutionize the genre. Black Sabbath were at their peak during the period when Judas Priest just released their debut album, and while Sabbath were playing their own style of music, with downtuned guitars and heavy riffs, Priest were playing more of a Hard Rock style. It all came down to 1976’s Sad Wings of Destiny, where Priest took Sabbath’s style, removed Blues influences, and added twin guitar to the mix. This trend was started by Judas Priest, and by the 80s, basically every single band were following this style. More than that, they also popularized the leather and chains gimmick of Heavy Metal band. Not to forget Motörhead, who, like Judas Priest, were equally important in the history of Heavy Metal. Bringing Punk into the mix, Motörhead’s fast and aggressive style of playing became influential to Thrash Metal. Iron Maiden, on the other hand, was quite different. Maiden had plenty of influences in their style, and was more influenced by Progressive Rock than any others. They ended up with their own style- unlike Judas Priest, whose style was more riff-oriented, Iron Maiden’s style was more melody-oriented. Also, the galloping style of songs, which was as a result of Steve Harris’s unique bass playing style, and lyrics inspired from history, mythology, literature anecdotes. Both the bands have quite a diverse discography, although Iron Maiden’s is more diverse. Iron Maiden’s later years, especially after 2000, can be considered as Progressive Metal, while Judas Priest has remained firmly attached to their roots. Talking about influences, both the bands are equally influential and important. But talking about which band is better, it would be better if left to one’s own preferences. For me, it will always be Iron Maiden."},{"prompt":"w do Democrats explain the peerreviewed paper on the 4 hidden algorithms found in the NY voter rolls using multiple obfuscation techniques built into the system?","completion":"Interesting that you didn’t provide a link.

A person’s body can develop during exercise in 2 days. One way is with a lot of repetition, this builds a more endurance based muscle. And the other is with a small amount of repetition and a large weight, this builds a large mass type of muscle that can lift a heavy load, but only a few times before it tires out. Look on that Japanese Ninja Warrior show, that’s literally a perfect example of what types of bodies real navy seals and stuff have (there is an American version of that show as well). Do you remember when a really big bulky guy tried to do the course and they always fail badly? It’s because they struggle to lift their own body weight for very long, they get tired easily. It’s also the same reason most MMA fighters don’t look like WWE actors or like bodybuilders, but instead MMA fighters are more slender and can fight for up to 25 minutes straight. It’s the same reason boxers also don’t look like bodybuilders. It’s the same reason almost no athlete on earth looks like a bodybuilder. Below are the bodies of the only men to ever win the Sasuke course (Ninja warrior). This is how the body develops for training that requires you to constantly be able to lift your own body, and over 10–15 minutes of it if necessary.

What should I do?","completion":"Okay, so I've read some of the answers here and I agree that your new partner should be kicked to the curb, but let me address a few things to help you. You are in the honeymoon phase of your relationship. A flood of hormones ransacing your brain are telling you that your partner is perfect, can do no wrong, therefore you need to compromise everywhere you can to please this creature God gifted to humanity. Unfortunately, statistically speaking, most life altering things people compromise on in early relationships become massive regrets later on in life. So truly think about that. Don't think about how you feel for this stranger you have been with for one month. Instead think about how you will feel after giving your dog up to please this individual. One month, one year, even five years from now. You've had this therapy dog for 10 years. That tells me your dog is a senior citizen in doggie years. You are that dogs trusted human. You are that dogs world, their UNIVERSE. If you give your dog up to please someone else, could you live with yourself after? Maybe your dog would live happily for the remainder of its life…or maybe it would become depressed wondering what it did wrong for it's human companion to abandon it. Then, what if this budding relationship fizzles out? Are you just gonna turn around and try to get the dog back that you just recently abandoned? Is it really worth putting the dog through that kind of stress and heartache? I get it. You are enthralled with your new partner. You want to do everything you can to make them happy, to make them love you more, but that doesn't mean giving up on everything important to you. Your dog is not just your pet, they are a part of your family, and if this partner of yours can't accept your family the way it is, well I can guarantee that you will find one who will. Making compromises and communicating are two very important factors of having a healthy and stable long term relationship, but there are some things that you should never compromise on. To me, that means anything that will cause you emotional or physical harm, anything that you can't live with yourself for having done, or anything that will intentionally/maliciously cause harm either emotionally or physically to someone else. Just remember, at the end of the day, your dog is always going to love you unconditionally. You can't say the same about this partner if they are already making comments about you getting rid of your dog. I realize it feels like the hardest choice in the world right now, but truly consider it. I hope this has helped you and may you and your pup live your happily ever after together for many more years to come! Edited for spelling. Auto correct clearly got me, again lol."},{"prompt":"Alexandria OcasioCortez said Going by track record, I’d feel safer in a bathroom with a trans woman than a powerful male executive any day of the week.

Lee ever return to Gettysburg or Appomattox?","completion":"There was never any reason why he would have, and there is no record of him ever returning to either place. He may have traversed some of the battlefields in the Wilderness/Spotsylvania area and Manassas when he visited Washington after the war, and he is known to have been in Richmond after the war, but that’s about it. He easily could have visited Appomattox from where he lived at Washington College (now Washington & Lee University) after the war; they are only about 60 miles apart. But he had no reason to ever do so. And Gettysburg probably pained him for the rest of his life. He knew he had made grave errors there. Pickett never forgave him, but Lee likely never forgave himself, either. Lee died in 1870, long before any commemorations of the Civil War occurred. Furthermore, he was opposed to such things and believed the South should put the war behind it and focus on rebuilding itself. This was one of the reasons why Lee accepted the leadership of Washington College after the war—he wanted to help the next generation. Even if Lee had lived to be a very old man (he was 63 when he died), it is unlikely he’d have ever wanted to return to those places."},{"prompt":"World War II, why did Stalin order that Moscow buildings be burned down, despite the freezing Russian winter?","completion":"Stalin never ordered to burn down buildings in Moscow. But there was a highly controversial Order 0428 (November 17, 1941) that commanded to burn down villages right behind the enemy lines and close to the main roads in order to leave German forces without shelter in winter. The Order claimed that Germans force locals out of their houses, but that wasn’t entirely true. The Order also demanded from retreating Soviet forces to take the civilian population with them. That wasn’t always done. In effect, Stalin ordered to burn down populated villages. That’s why it was a controversial, criminal and likely wrong (from the military standpoint) decision, probably based on faulty information and inspired by the burning of Moscow in 1812 and Finnish tactics during the Winter War. In practice, special arsonist groups sent by the Soviet command mostly tried to burn down specific buildings primarily occupied by Germans.

But to me, I consider it a challenge. You don’t want gluten or sea food, and you like your steaks well done? Challenge accepted! I have an unofficial mental list of dishes that impress middle to upper-middle class midwesterners. I sift through that eliminating things that the guests don’t want to eat, and choose from what’s left. Generally I have a theme of things that midwestern Americans have heard of but don’t really know what it is, combined with familiar things that with a little effort you can make way better than the average restaurant. For example; Prime rib with Yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. You would be surprised how many people from middle America don’t know what Yorkshire pudding is, have never had really good gravy, and couldn’t recognize a potato ricer if their life depended on it. Filet Mignon and properly seared sea scallops. So simple, so good. Tagliatelle Bolognese. Hand made pasta, my wife’s bolognese (her’s is simply better than mine). Good Italian wine. Pannukakku. It’s a Finnish “pancake” (except it’s more like a dutch baby). If I’m cooking breakfast it’s either pannu and sausage, or home made hash, extra crispy, with seeded rye toast. Oysters 3 ways. On the half-shell, char grilled with garlic herb butter, and deep fried. I live in the UP of Michigan, and if all else fails I can go with fried smelt and home made tartar sauce.

The founder of Bridgewater Associates wrote about monetary policy and the markets over the last 50 years. He said investors have been over-investing in stocks and other equity-like assets that will most likely see diminishing returns. “The world is leveraged long, holding assets that have low real and nominal expected returns that are also providing historically low returns relative to cash returns. I think these are unlikely to be good real-returning investments.” He also cited historical shifts in the geopolitical and macroeconomic climate, such as in the Great Depression and World Wars, to explain the coming “paradigm shift” that will soon face the economy. He said the financial crisis was the last major “paradigm shift” and blamed unsustainable growth rates as a root cause. Dalio said the best investments are those that “do well when the value of money is being depreciated and domestic and international conflicts are significant, such as gold.” He said that it may be “risk-reducing and return-enhancing” for investors to add the precious metal to their portfolio. “In paradigm shifts, most people get caught overextended doing something overly popular and get really hurt,” he wrote. “On the other hand, if you’re astute enough to understand these shifts, you can navigate them well or at least protect yourself against them.” Read The Full Article Here [LINKED_TEXT: How to invest in gold | Is good to invest in gold | How to invest in gold and silver] [URL: https://medium.com%2F@medium.com/@ravibarik852/how-to-invest-in-gold-is-good-to-invest-in-gold-how-to-invest-in-gold-and-silver-b24d72cb47b1]"},{"prompt":"Why is Gov.

She cares nothing for the Native People's believes, wishes or ever their rights. She cares nothing for responsible environmental management. And she cares nothing for the greater good of this country. She is like a 2 year old child, wants what she wants when she wants it regardless of what is right and will do whatever she can to try and make that happen. Biden didn't put the ban in place. The prohibition against firework was established back in 2009 because of the horrible environmental impact they were having and because the Native People strongly objected to them being used on the sacred grounds. Trump, not caring about either of those objections, created some nonsensical narrative about how the ban was some kind of effort to “erase our history” and authorized a huge fireworks show (right in the middle of the pandemic) and had a major “celebration” on July 4, 2020. The problem with bringing some kind of lawsuit is, Mount Rushmore doesn't belong to South Dakota. It belongs to the federal government and she has no standing to say what happens in federal land. So, it is highly unlikely ANY court is going to side with her. And she knows it. Her two concerns are, to rally her GQP base and use this as another manufactured crisis of how the poor conservatives are being oppressed by the big, bad democratic administration and how they are so picked on by the mean Ole Federal Government.

Users want a simple experience when navigating your website, and they likely won’t remain on your webpage if it has a poor design. Take a look at the following piece which elaborates on the importance of website usability: [LINKED_TEXT: Website Navigation Tools: Why You Need Website 'GPS'] [URL: https://blog.walkme.com/website-navigation-tools/?t=20&para1=SMQ] What are website navigation tools? A website navigation tool is the part of a website that helps the user successfully get from one point to another. Typically, websites have these tools built visibly into the design, like a navigation bar at the top of the page or a search bar that allows the user to search for particular information within the site. With user experience in mind, website navigation tools should, ideally, help the user to get from point A to B in the fewest clicks possible. Tools like a navigation bar, breadcrumb trail, or site map provide a map for the user to read and navigate through the site themselves. For example, if a user starts from the home page and clicks through multiple pages to reach their final destination, it is helpful for them to see a breadcrumb trail of how they got there. Traditional Website Navigation Tools Don’t Always Work Currently, most online systems rely on “fold out map” style navigation for users to know where they are, how they got there and where they should go next. Website navigation tools are usually found as a part of the URL or as a clickable list at the top of the page. But, just like how printing out directions for a road trip may not be as helpful as using a GPS, these navigation tools can [LINKED_TEXT: often fall short] [URL: https://blog.walkme.com/customer-journey-pain-points/] of giving the user an optimal experience. An optimal website navigation experience includes directions for where to go, not just where you have been. And to make it even more helpful, navigation should include how to get there. The Best Website Navigation Tool is WalkMe’s DAP Fortunately, WalkMe’s Digital Adoption Platform (DAP) is the GPS of website navigation tools. When a user is not sure how to get from A to B, or wants to know the most efficient way, WalkMe will provide onscreen guidance to take them on the best possible route to get there. In the same way we trust a GPS to tell us at the right time when to turn next, users can trust WalkMe to show them where to click or look to next when they need help. Walk-Thrus, which are step-by-step guidance balloons that point the user to where they need to go, are one of the main and most popular apps. Beyond the balloon guidance, other WalkMe apps such as ShoutOuts and Launchers help draw user attention to certain parts of a site. A ShoutOut is similar to a pop-up message and can play on a site when you want to let the user know that there is guidance available. Launchers are buttons on the page that start WalkMe apps. For example, when the user needs help, they may want to click on a “Help” or “Guide Me” launcher to help them through a potentially difficult process on the site.

For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","completion":"Magazine is what feeds the rounds to the camber. It typically has a spring that does it. Magazines can be either fixed or removable. Sometimes they are removable but still loaded like they were fixed. A magazine typically holds 5–30 rounds. Magazine: Clips are used to feed rounds into a magazine, typically one that is fixed but sometimes also on a separate magazine. There are two basic types of clips. Stripper clip and en block clip. Stripper clips is put on top of the magazine and rounds are pushed into the magazine. When the bolt is closed the clip is thrown away. One can also load the rounds separately. En block clip is pushed to the magazine with the rounds. After the last round is fired the clip is ejected either from the top or bottom. In some cases it is ejected only when a new is pushed. One needs the clip to use the magazine. Modern rifles use large removable magazines so clips are less common. Stripper clip: En bloc clips: Sometimes the word clip is used also on magazines especially in case of pistols. This is technically incorrect. An assault rifle is an infantry standard rifle that fires both single shots and fully automatic (sometimes limited to three round bursts). It typically uses an intermediate cartridge that makes the automatic fire more controllable than on older full power rifles. Assault riles can be traced back to the original STG-44 made in Germany during the war: An assault rifle: StG44: Assault rifles typically have more metallic look than older rifles which had a large wooden stock. They have things like pistol grips. Assault gun is or was a tank that had no turret or an armored gun as in the German organization they were different from tanks including the uniforms of the crew. Assault guns: They originally were intended for infantry support on assault. Later they were witted with longer guns and were more used as tank destroyers and are really indistinguishable from those. In modern use they are replaced by Infantry fighting vehicles. They have smaller automatic cannon and can carry the troops inside. Assault weapon is a made up term. As a general rule it covers semi-automatic civilian versions of assault rifles and some other weapons. The rules can be arbitrary and over cosmetic or ergonomic details like bayonet mounts and pistol grips. AR is just what weapons manufacturer ArmaLite used as symbols of its weapons. They were AR-number. In this context most important are AR-15 the 5.56 mm assault rifle that became M16 series rifles. Colt later started to sell it as semi-automatic for civilians with the same name: AR-15. The rights to the weapon have expired so others make it also but they cannot use the name AR-15. AR-10 is older version made in 7.62x51 caliber i.e. more powerful. AR-18 is a further development in order to make it cheaper. It is far less common. All these were originally made as fully automatic but the civilian versions are semi-automatic only. Not all ARs are “assault weapons”. AR-7 is a .22 caliber survival rifle: While the bore diameter is same as with AR-15 the bullet has only about one third of the muzzle velocity.

Rumor has it that Chinese sashimi is full of parasites and cannot be eaten.","completion":"First of all, “sashimi” is a dish from Japanese cuisine. There is no such thing as “Chinese sashimi” unless you are eating at a Japanese restaurant in China, but then again, why would you do that? That would be like going to an Italian restaurant in the Philippines and expecting to get authentic Italian cuisine. It’s possible, but it’s not a guarantee. Just like it’s possible that the sashimi in China is just as rigorously selected by the head sushi chef who actually Japanese, and is imported from the fish markets in Japan, which have the highest standards for fish that is considered “sushi grade.” (On the other hand, Japan has the highest number of reported cases of seafood related parasites in the world.) The dish you may be referring to is a raw fish salad served in Southern China called “Yu Sheng.” It is traditionally made with freshwater river fish, and was probably the original inspiration for Japanese sushi, as it was being served before sushi existed. Fresh water fish usually have more parasites than marine fish, and this dish is even outlawed from being served in Hong Kong as being “too risky.” Raw fish in general is inherently risky. According to marine biologists and seafood experts alike, parasites in fish are natural, not a contamination. Fish caught in the wild commonly have some sort of parasites, and fish that is considered “sushi grade” has been frozen at -4 degrees for 7 days to destroy the parasites that are present. They may be dead, but they are still there. So let’s not be prejudiced and racist: It’s not just “Chinese sashimi” that is full of parasites, it’s ALL sashimi. So maybe your rumors are dead wrong, and just that, a rumor. Or maybe they’re correct and you are eating parasite ridden fish. The real question is, why are you ordering a risky dish like raw seafood from a restaurant that you mistrust, in a country that is not known for that particular dish??? That seems foolish at best (if you are a newbie traveler) and downright stupid if you expect/demand perfection in this situation. Go get dim sum, west lake duck, dancing shrimp, or some other Chinese specialty and you’ll be much more likely to have a tasty, parasite-free meal. Go to Japan for sashimi. In China it’s just a plate of uncooked fish."},{"prompt":"What are some less known facts about Mars?","completion":"Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather.

Now I can finally with peace, answer this question. So starting off with some general points: · Do some bird watching, without being looked like a creep. (but in a good way, more like finding a crush) · They are the best detective in the world. · Also scolds like a mom when you start doing weird/bad stuff. If I keep going on I think it will turn out to be way more lengthy and a boring piece (also with my bad grammar I am sure to get a scolding from her once she reads this). Well for this answer as I have not yet asked her permission to use her name I will go with the nickname which only I use (because that’s one of our secrets), Dinosaur or Dino. (Will explain this if the relevant question again arrives in my feeds) Incident 1: So this incident happened a day before my grandmother (Dadiji) passed away. (Numbering the days so can get a general idea how the event unfolded) Day 1: At night around 9oclock we did a video call to my Aunt’s home to check how Dadiji was (she was staying there for some time). After the video when I saw my Dadiji I was really depressed as she was not in good condition at all and were looking like lifeless during that stage. I was scared of what I saw. Day 2: The next morning at 10oclock I called Dino since I was way too scared and my hands were shivering. She was sleeping at that time and also angry at me (we do fight a lot). Also, one thing about Dino is that she loves to eat and the only other thing that she loves more than food is sleep. She picked up the call half asleep and was asking “what happened?” (still asleep), I replied by telling what happened and how I was feeling within sec. she woke herself from sleep and got into full support mode and made sure I release all my emotions. (Well the time she sleeps in class then wakes up it roughly takes her 5mins to come back to senses) After few days: I was not eating anything after the incident and neither was I sleeping properly and she noticed one day I became too weak she forced me to eat by saying “Chal chalete hai Maggi khate hai mera bahut maan kar raha hai!” (Come on let's go eat some Maggi, I am in a mood to eat some), she knows that I would never eat alone, I knew very well how full her stomach was that day, even then also she ate with me (she was getting late also to go back home). And called me when back I was back home whether I was taking care of myself or not. So next, Incident 2: This incident happened on my Birthday. Let me tell you one thing for me I am excited for my birthday but I know it would be a lonely one just people wishing me due to their Facebook forced them to wish me and then some random messages (well mostly copied once) on WhatsApp and then the day end with nothing special. (Just a few calls from my 10th class friends which makes my day generally) This year again I was expecting this, as the day before my birthday Dino and I ended up having a huge fight and were damn angry with each other. At 9oclock in the evening, a day before my birthday we talked and things got good since there was no mistake at all from either of us. It was already 11:30 pm and just 30mins remained for my birthday and I was wishing that the call went on and I want her to wish me the first but she said she was sleepy and will call back to wish me. And as I have told earlier if she is sleepy it means she will sleep and only wake up the next morning. But this time at sharp 12:00 am she called me to wish me my birthday. I was so happy that moment I can’t tell those feeling in words. Just so you all can imagine how it felt then, this was my first time when someone called me at exactly 12:00 am to wish me my birthday. I know for most of the people it is a normal thing but for me, this is what I call being treated as special, then we talked for about 10-15mins and because of that fight earlier we were tired and we ended our call and went to sleep, (More people did wish me after that) but those were on WhatsApp or a bit later. (Two of my friends completely forgot about it and I am still upset about that fact) So these are something how I am going to define my unique piece. I am truly blessed for having her in my life. And I always want her to be my best friend. I can share all my secrets with her, crack all my lamest jokes that I can ever think of (even though her lame jokes are of no match to mine), share all my emotions with her, and yet not get judged for a single thing, rather she a lot of times guides me in telling what is good and what is not. Sorry for my bad grammar and she sure going to scold me for all the grammatical faults I have made.

Pripyat had to be evacuated, and radiation levels are still dangerous. The Fukushima nuclear disaster wasn’t as severe, only because they had better safety measures in place. Three Mile Island here in the US was another very close call. Chernobyl was by far the worst because the Russians thought that they were saving money and time by not including a containment structure around the reactor.

I’ve learned that you should never compare yourself to others. When you compare yourself to others, you are telling yourself that you are not good enough. You are telling yourself that you don’t measure up. It’s a slippery slope from comparison to comparison-based envy. Envy is torture. And it’s a poison that can infiltrate your life and make you feel lost and helpless. I’ve also learned that it’s best to accept yourself for who you are and to continue on the path of self-discovery and self-improvement. When you are aware of who you are and accept it, it becomes easier to move forward with path that is yours, not someone else’s. And finally, I have come to understand that when it comes to happiness and fulfillment, it is up to us to provide it. In order to be content, we must become our own source of joy. We must become our own guardians and protectors. We must learn to embrace the joy and happiness within ourselves, not just look for it in others.

He was unable to show his retaliation and might to these small band of sikhs because he and his army was badly tired of long battles and he had to return back to his country. Next time Abdaali himself led a furious attack on reunited Sikhs in Feb 1762 .Inspiration of their unification was Sarbat Khalsa at Amritsar .Petty disputes of Sikh leaders were settled at Darbar Khalsa and the leader of these reunited sikh was elected unanimously. Abdaali with the help of governer Sirhind and Lahore,he chased Sikhs and their families in every nuke and corner. About 20 thousands Sikhs along with their families were killed in this hollocaust called big hollocaust.But this holocaust also could not defeat Sikhs,but proved a night mare for Abdali . Destruction of Golden Temple by Abdaali to humiliate Sikh morals ,reunited scattered Sikhs with more enthusiasm and energy to revenge. This act of Abdali to destroy Golden Temple was end of mighty king of Kabul. This time Abdali was defeated by Sikhs ,about 5 thousands of Afgan soldiers surrendered . Sikhs used these captive Afghan army to cleane the sacred pound around golden temple and to rebuild Golden Temple. Defeated Abdaali returned to Kabul and never look back to words India. United Sikh chiefs made confederation of (confederacies ) called Misals.From 1762 to 1799 Sikh chiefs were independent warlords of their confederacies. Sikh kingdom was established in1799.

Officially, Curry is listed as 6'3\\" by the NBA, which is his height without shoes. However, some people might perceive him as shorter than that due to his lean frame and playing style. Additionally, some players in the NBA may exaggerate their height, leading to discrepancies between official listings and actual heights. On the other hand, some people might perceive Curry as shorter than 6'3\\" due to the way he plays on the court. Curry is known for his quickness, agility, and ability to create space from defenders, which might make him seem smaller than he actually is. Additionally, Curry is often compared to other NBA players who are taller and more physically imposing, which might further emphasize his perceived lack of height. Overall, it is important to remember that height can be subjective and influenced by various factors.

Mattresses are one of the most important factors to avoid back pain as most people spend at least 7 hours on them each day. Sleeping on a bad mattress can cause back pain as they usually lack back support and can affect the alignment of the back. It is definitely worth taking the time to select the best mattress for your body that supports your back whilst you sleep and one that is comfortable to sleep on. The type of mattress you choose must be comfortable and have the necessary back support to reduce back pain and give you a good night's sleep. A good mattress usually is around 7 to 18 inches deep with a good number of spring coils for support allowing the body to be supported and at the same time allowing for the natural curves and alignment of the spine. [LINKED_TEXT: A good mattress] [URL: https://geekygadgets.in/best-mattress-india/] can be bought by going to a showroom that has lots of brands and varieties, and start by lying on the firmest mattresses the store has to offer. Then lie on the softest ones. That gives two good comparison points. Find a mattress that is between the two endpoints, but closer to the firmest ones than the softest. Get on the mattress in your normal sleep position and evaluate the mattress for the level of comfort and support that feels right for you also discuss their mattress purchase with their doctors. The majority of back stiffness occurs while sleeping, to reduce this from occurring you can: *Make sure that your pillow can support your neck, but too many pillows can cause neck strain. Sleep on a contoured pillow to avoid neck strain – you want to keep your neck and spine in-line while you sleep. *Try putting a small pillow between your knees when you sleep. This will help keep your hips in-line, avoiding lower back stiffness. Ensure your mattress is big enough for you and your partner. If you are sharing a small mattress, you may sleep in awkward positions because you are being crowded out. A saggy mattress contributes to muscle stiffness and chronic back pain, this can be avoided by purchasing an orthopedic mattress that contains more support than a regular mattress. *If you have trouble sleeping, try lying on your back with a pillow under your knees, or sleeping on your side with your knees bent and a pillow between your knees. *Your bed should be a height that makes it easy to get into and out of. When getting in, sit on the edge, lower your body on to one elbow and shoulder, and draw up your knees and then feet. Reverse the procedure to get out. The other option is to go for an adjustable bed they are different than standard flat beds because they allow users to change the incline angle of the head of the bed and, in many cases, at the foot of the bed as well. A slight incline of the head (no more than 45), coupled with additional support under the knees, can help reduce pain, particularly leg and back pain from herniated discs and/or spinal stenosis. It also helps a patient to get out of bed without having to roll and sit up as much as if one was rising from a flat position."},{"prompt":"w can you stop a car if someone cuts the brakes?","completion":"Handbrake is usually mechanical to avoid loss of brakes due to lack of hydraulic pressure."},{"prompt":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","completion":"Why would be upset about Jungkook, a 24 year old man having tattoos?

That’s why they hire consultants. Consultants typically follow a standard method of problem identification. They don't worry about politics. They’re not concerned with losing their jobs. So they can say things that employees won’t. Furthermore most companies are so understaffed, they can’t (or won’t) allocate resources for innovation. Companies are so worried about today, they don’t think about tomorrow. Yet innovation is a key capability for any company—and should not be outsourced to consultants. In The Innovator’s Solution, Clayton Christensen recommended dedicating a team to explore a specific set of problems to be solved—and separating them from the teams maintaining today’s products. You can also innovate in your current products by focusing on problems instead of features. Many engineering teams have a never-ending list of customer requests, sales demands, and executive mandates. So they simply build what has been requested in a feature-building factory model.

What happens to a material if its Poisson’s ratio changes from negative to positive value?","completion":"Poisson's ratio is a measure of the relationship between the change in lateral dimension of a material and the change in its axial dimension when subjected to an axial load. It is expressed as a fraction, where the numerator is the change in the lateral dimension and the denominator is the change in the axial dimension. Poisson's ratio can have a value between 0 and 0.5, with a value of 0 indicating that a material does not undergo lateral expansion, and a value of 0.5 indicating that the lateral expansion is equal to the axial compression. In some materials, Poisson's ratio is negative, meaning that the lateral expansion is in the opposite direction to the axial compression. If a material's Poisson's ratio changes from a negative to a positive value, it means that the material has undergone a change in its mechanical properties. This can be due to factors such as changes in temperature, stress, or composition. In general, a change in Poisson's ratio can have significant implications for the behavior of a material under load, as it affects its ability to deform and absorb energy. For example, a material with a low Poisson's ratio is generally stiffer and stronger, while a material with a high Poisson's ratio is more ductile and capable of absorbing more energy before failure. Understanding the behavior of a material in response to changes in its Poisson's ratio is an important aspect of materials science and engineering, and is essential for the design and optimization of many products and structures."},{"prompt":"w many countries have you travelled to and which are they?","completion":"JapanN.

Let me tell you about the most unbelievable garden of antiquity - Babylon Hanging Garden. The [LINKED_TEXT: Hanging Gardens of Babylon] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon/] were the fabled gardens which adorned the capital of the Neo-Babylonian [LINKED_TEXT: Empire] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/empire/], built by its greatest king [LINKED_TEXT: Nebuchadnezzar II] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Nebuchadnezzar_II/] (r. 605-562 BCE). One of [LINKED_TEXT: the Seven Wonders] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/The_Seven_Wonders/] of the Ancient World, they are the only wonder whose existence is disputed amongst historians. Some scholars claim the gardens were actually at [LINKED_TEXT: Nineveh] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/nineveh/], capital of the Assyrian Empire, some stick with the ancient writers and await [LINKED_TEXT: archaeology] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Archaeology/] to provide positive proof, and still others believe they are merely a figment of the ancient imagination. Archaeology at [LINKED_TEXT: Babylon] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/babylon/] itself and ancient Babylonian texts are silent on the matter, but ancient writers describe the gardens as if they were at Nebuchadnezzar’s capital and still in existence in [LINKED_TEXT: Hellenistic] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Hellenistic/] times. The exotic nature of the gardens compared to the more familiar [LINKED_TEXT: Greek] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/greek/] items on the list and the mystery surrounding their location and disappearance have made the Hanging Gardens of Babylon the most captivating of all the [LINKED_TEXT: Seven Wonders] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Seven_Wonders/]. Babylon & Nebuchadnezzar II Babylon, located about 80 km (50 miles) south of modern Baghdad in Iraq, was an ancient [LINKED_TEXT: city] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/city/] with a history of settlement dating back to the 3rd millennium BCE. The greatest period in the city’s history was in the 6th century BCE during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II when the city was the capital of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The empire had been founded by Nebuchadnezzar’s father Nabopolassar (r. 625-605 BCE) after his victories over the Assyrian Empire. Nebuchadnezzar II would go on to even greater things, including the capture of [LINKED_TEXT: Jerusalem] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/jerusalem/] in 597 BCE. The Babylonian king then set about making his capital one of the most splendid [LINKED_TEXT: cities] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/cities/] in the world. The [LINKED_TEXT: Ishtar Gate] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Ishtar_Gate/] was built c. 575 BCE with its fine towers and depictions in tiles of animals both real and imaginary, a 7-20 km brick double [LINKED_TEXT: wall] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/wall/] surrounded the city - the largest ever built - and then, possibly, he added the extensive pleasure gardens whose fame spread throughout the ancient world. The first mention in an ancient source of the gardens is by Berossus of [LINKED_TEXT: Kos] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Kos/], c. 290 BCE. The Gardens The majority of scholars agree that the idea of cultivating gardens purely for pleasure, as opposed to the production of food, originated in the [LINKED_TEXT: Fertile Crescent] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Fertile_Crescent/], where they were known as a paradise. From there the notion would spread throughout the ancient [LINKED_TEXT: Mediterranean] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/mediterranean/] so that by Hellenistic times even private individuals, or at least the wealthier ones, were cultivating their own private gardens in their homes. Gardens were not just about flowers and plants, either, as architectural, sculptural, and water features were added, and even the views were a consideration for the ancient landscape gardener. Gardens became such a desired feature that [LINKED_TEXT: fresco] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Fresco/] painters, such as those at [LINKED_TEXT: Pompeii] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/pompeii/], covered entire walls of villas with scenes which gave the illusion that on entering a room one was also entering a garden. All of these outdoor pleasant places, then, owed their existence to ancient [LINKED_TEXT: Mesopotamia] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Mesopotamia/] and, above all, to the magnificent Hanging Gardens of Babylon. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were sometimes referred to as the Hanging Gardens of [LINKED_TEXT: Semiramis] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Semiramis/] after the semi-legendary and semi-divine female Assyrian ruler thought by the Greeks to have extensively rebuilt Babylon in the 9th century BCE. [LINKED_TEXT: Herodotus] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/herodotus/], the 5th-century BCE Greek historian, describes the impressive irrigation system of Babylon and the walls but does not mention any gardens specifically (although the Great [LINKED_TEXT: Sphinx] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/sphinx/] is also curiously missing from his description of [LINKED_TEXT: Giza] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/giza/]). The first mention in an ancient source of the gardens is by Berossus of Kos, actually, a priest named Bel-Usru from Babylon who relocated to the Greek island. [LINKED_TEXT: Writing] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/writing/] c. 290 BCE, Berossus’ work survives only as quoted excerpts in that of later writers, but many of his descriptions of Babylon have been corroborated by archaeology. [LINKED_TEXT: Hanging Gardens of Babylon by Martin Heemskerck (Public Domain)] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/image/77/hanging-gardens-of-babylon/] Berossus describes high stone terraces which imitated mountains and which were planted with many types of large trees and flowers. Terraces would not only have created a pleasant aesthetic effect of hanging vegetation but also made their irrigation easier. Berossus also explains why the gardens were established, to make a wife of the Babylonian king, a Mede called Amytis, feel less homesick for her green and hilly homeland. Alas, there is no reference to a queen of that name in Babylonian records. Diodorus Siculus notes that the terraces of the gardens sloped upwards like an ancient [LINKED_TEXT: theatre] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/theatre/] & reached a height of 20 metres. Several other sources describe the gardens as if they were still in existence in the 4th century BCE, but all were written centuries after the reign of Nebuchadnezzar and all were written by writers who almost certainly never visited Babylon and who knew little of either horticulture or engineering. Strabo, the Greek geographer (c. 64 BCE - c. 24 CE), describes the location of the gardens as by the Euphrates, which ran through ancient Babylon, and a complicated machinery of screws which drew water up from the river to water the gardens. He also mentions the presence of stairs to reach the various levels. Meanwhile, the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, also writing in the 1st century BCE, notes that the terraces sloped upwards like an ancient theatre and reached a total height of 20 metres (65 ft). He describes the terraces as being built on pillars and lined with reeds and bricks. There are known precedents for large gardens in Mesopotamia which pre-date those said to have been at Babylon. There are even depictions of them, for example, on a relief panel from the North [LINKED_TEXT: Palace] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/palace/] of [LINKED_TEXT: Ashurbanipal] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Ashurbanipal/] (668–631 BCE) at Nineveh, now in the British Museum, London. Indeed, some scholars suggest that the whole Babylonian gardens idea is the result of a monumental mix-up, and it is Nineveh which actually had the fabled wonder, built there by [LINKED_TEXT: Sennacherib] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/sennacherib/] (r. 705-681 BCE). There is ample textual and archaeological evidence of gardens at Nineveh, and the city was sometimes even referred to as ‘old Babylon’. In any case, even if the hypothesis of Nineveh is accepted, it still does not preclude the possibility of gardens at Babylon. [LINKED_TEXT: Assyrian Gardens by The British Museum (Copyright)] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/image/9063/assyrian-gardens/] There were also gardens after the supposed date for the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, those at [LINKED_TEXT: Pasargadae] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Pasargadae/] in the Zagros Mountains built by [LINKED_TEXT: Cyrus the Great] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Cyrus_the_Great/] (d. 530 BCE), for example. All such gardens usually had terraces to aid irrigation, high walls to provide shade, trees were clustered together so as to better maintain their vital moisture and withstand scorching winds, and, of course, all were located near an abundant water source. That gardens were commonly associated with palaces (in just about every culture from ancient [LINKED_TEXT: China] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/china/] to Mesoamerica) has led some scholars to speculate that the gardens at Babylon, if they did exist, would also have been near or in one of the royal palaces of Nebuchadnezzar on the banks of the River Euphrates. The Seven Wonders Some of the monuments of the ancient world so impressed visitors from far and wide with their beauty, artistic and architectural ambition, and sheer scale that their reputation grew as must-see (themata) sights for the ancient traveller and pilgrim. Seven such monuments became the original 'bucket list' when ancient writers such as Herodotus, Callimachus of [LINKED_TEXT: Cyrene] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/cyrene/], [LINKED_TEXT: Antipater] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Antipater/] of [LINKED_TEXT: Sidon] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/sidon/], and Philo of [LINKED_TEXT: Byzantium] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Byzantium/] compiled shortlists of the most wonderful sights of the ancient world. In many early lists of the ancient wonders the gardens were listed alongside the magnificent walls of the city of Babylon which were, according to Strabo, 7 km long, in places 10 metres thick and 20 metres high, and regularly punctuated by even taller towers. The author P. [LINKED_TEXT: Jordan] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Jordan/] suggests that the gardens made it on to the established list of Seven Wonders of the Ancient World because they \\"appealed for sheer luxurious and romantic perversity of endeavour\\" (18). After Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon continued to be an important city as part of the [LINKED_TEXT: Achaemenid] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Achaemenid/] (550-330 BCE) and [LINKED_TEXT: Seleucid] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Seleucid/] Empires (312-63 BCE), the rulers of both entities often using the palaces at Babylon as their residence. Taken over in succession by the Parthians, the Arsacids and Sasanids, the city still maintained its regional strategic significance and, therefore, it is perfectly possible that the gardens survived for several centuries after their construction. Systematic archaeological excavations began at ancient Babylon in 1899 CE, and although many ancient structures such as the double walls and the [LINKED_TEXT: Ishtar] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/ishtar/] Gate have been found, there is no trace of the legendary gardens. A promising find of 14 vaulted rooms during excavations of the South Palace of Babylon turned out - after tablets were subsequently discovered on the spot and deciphered - to be nothing more spectacular than storerooms, albeit large ones. Another series of excavations much nearer the river and part of another of the king’s palaces have revealed large drains, walls, and what could have been a reservoir, all necessary irrigation features for the gardens but not proof positive of the fabled lost wonder. [LINKED_TEXT: Ruins of the North Palace of Nebuchadnezzar II , Babylon by Osama Shukir Muhammed Amin (CC BY-NC-SA)] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/image/2563/ruins-of-the-north-palace-of--nebuchadnezzar-ii--b/] Aside from the silence of archaeology, significantly, no Babylonian sources mention the gardens - either their construction or existence, even in a ruined state. This is perhaps the most damning evidence against the gardens having been at Babylon because the surviving Babylonian records include comprehensive descriptions of Nebuchadnezzar’s achievements and construction projects right down to the street names of Babylon. Despite the lack of physical and contemporary textual evidence, it seems difficult to believe that the gardens never existed at all when their legend stimulated such coverage by ancient writers and they held their place on the list of wonders for so long. If the neat idea that the gardens were really at Nineveh is rejected, then the likely answer, as always, seems somewhere in the middle. The original lists of wonders were compiled by either Greek writers or those writing for a Hellenistic audience and what would have more impressed a Greek, used to dry terraced hillsides of olive groves, than a lush garden of exotica ingeniously irrigated in the impossibly hot climate of Iraq? Perhaps, there was a garden of some sort at Babylon, and its scale became exaggerated just as the palace of [LINKED_TEXT: Knossos] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/knossos/] on [LINKED_TEXT: Crete] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/crete/] was made into a mythical [LINKED_TEXT: labyrinth] [URL: https://www.ancient.eu/Labyrinth/] by previous generations of Greek authors. Perhaps, time will tell as archaeology continues its slow and laborious investigations into the past. If anything, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon are the supreme example of why the idea of the Seven Wonders was created in the first place - a shortlist of truly wonderful human endeavours which few would ever see for themselves but which, nevertheless, still stimulated wonder, discussion, and emulation.

We had two movies that connected with each other, those being Iron Man and Iron Man 2. Thor, Hulk, and Captain America were separate from Iron Man. They all teamed up in The Avengers, finally linking everything together. The story continued in phase 2 and culminated in phase 3 with Infinity War and Endgame. A lot of people don’t seem to realize that phase 4’s job is not to deliver Endgame tier movies. Its job is to explore the MCU after Endgame, test the formula, and set up for another huge crossover. This is essentially phase 1 again, just bigger. It might not look like they’ll connect, but they will, just like phase 1. -The upvotes load before the views"},{"prompt":"w do I get a mentor for usmle?","completion":"Go to your med school's Student Services or Student Affairs Office and inquire.

It is possible now that not only can multiple faults of occur but multiple fault messages add to the confusion. Take for example Asiana at San Francisco. The pilots always relied on autothrottle on approach to maintain speed. They didn't realize certain actions could disconnect the autothrottle BESIDES the disconnect thumb buttons.

Dofollow backlink passes the authority (link juice) from the referring website to the linked website. Crawlers count these links and their anchor texts. Therefore, do-follow backlinks directly influence your backlink profile because they send a signal to search engines what is the linked website about. What is a No-follow backlink? The no-follow backlink does not pass the authority because the rel=\\"no-follow \\"tag in the HTML code of the website tells crawlers not to follow these backlinks.

A good leader knows about the skills and talents of their followers. A good leader would know how to bring out the best in them. They would know how to motivate others according to their kind. Their communication style would be respectful, yet determined, validating and clear. They would be able to communicate expectations , rules, goals clearly. They would stand firm for their values and won’t hang their flag according to the wind. This would make them look trustworthy and competent.

It depends on how psyc. minded and degree of insight each has, and their level of empathic awareness. It depends on their psychological and emotional development, and how individuated they are as individuals, and as a couple; meaning are there two Selves, or are they enmeshed, disengaged, what’s a happening , and what are they individually working on trying to accomplish. The questioner is leaving herself out of the equation as neutral and not impacting the relationship which is impossible. You are also comparing psychopathological categories and not people, who even if they have been diagnosed as these things, come in all shapes and sizes. There is not one obsessive compulsive, or one narcissist, like comparing things, so if you know the measurements, any other thing of the same dimensions will also fit. If you see people over many years, what you end up experiencing are people struggling with similar issues, but it is their courage and tenacity to find understanding and eventual healing which is more important than their diagnosis. I am not depreciating the importance of diagnosis, per se, but if that becomes how we “know” others, as “things” to be compared, which is easier to live with, which is better, worse, potentially more troublesome, we dehumanize them and ourselves.

In terms of The Law of the universe; everything is energy, EVERYTHING. So the Law of Attraction is just another aspect of the universal energy law. So thoughts, music, speech, EMF, etc are all energy, which will also have a profound effect on water. There is a Japanese Scientist who spent years studying the effects that both positive & negative energies have on water. His name escapes me, buy his work was profound. So in a nut shell, everything is energy. So in the Law of Attraction you protocol, your are strengthening & directing the energy you are broadcasting consciously. What you need to absolutely understand; you are not a separate being, you are energetically connected to the all; consequently, you are broadcasting your thoughts anyway. So all the LOA does is teach you to broadcast consciously instead of on auto pilot. You are currently manifesting everything that is in your life anyway, so until you take responsibility for that, then apply the LOA protocols as set out, you can then change your outcome. That is all the LOA is. Taking over the directing of your desires consciously. It’s not magic, it’s simply becoming conscious, having choice & implementing it. Serenity = accepting what you can’t change (the weather, other people etc.)Courage = Change the things you can (Namely yourself)Wisdom = Knowing the difference between to two. Insanity is doing the same stuff & expecting a different outcome. You just need to get off auto pilot & take responsibility / control of your thoughts, behaviours & strive diligently for your stated desires / goals.

While I cant aspire to tell you all about handling a team in this space, I will attempt to give you some tips on it. Know your team: This is the most basic step and the most important one of all. You must know some background about your team members such as their qualifications, where they stay, info on their family, their hobbies and interests, why they joined this job, what do they aspire to achieve in their work and what skills they possess and what do they excel in. How to do it: Through casual chit chat when someone comes to get a leave sanctioned, when you meet your team during coffee / lunch breaks, when you have spare time after office hours, when you meet up for some activities out of office and so on. How does it help: Knowing your team can give you a grip on their aspirations, challenges they face outside office, their strengths and areas of improvement. Basically you will know what drives them. 2. Know their strengths: Not everybody is good at everything. So don't compare your team members or appreciate only those who meet your expectations on just a few parameters. Somebody can be good in coding, someone can be good with client interaction, someone else is better with designing and some with MIS. Understand and appreciate that people are diverse. Don’t worry about the methods each one uses to get a job done, instead focus on the end result. Rotate people on jobs to know who is good at what. Appreciate them for their core competencies and help them manage their weak areas. 3. Be a leader: Managing people is not about directing them or using authority. You are responsible to facilitate the team to achieve collective success. Your team’s success is your success. See what bottlenecks the team has, ease them out, be their spokesperson. Be constructively critical. Don’t hesitate to help them in their workload. Earn respect. Your team should not fear you but respect you. 4. Be a Mentor, give feedback, help your team: Talk to your team members individually (say during a weekly / fornightly / monthly review). Let them know how well they are doing. Tell them their strong points and also their areas of improvement and what they can do to improve themselves. Give them resources to help them improve (training, self learning time, group / buddy learning initiatives). Teach them the way to make themselves visible and grow to the next levels 5. Delegate and be willing to let go: Delegate important tasks to the team, only if you have a good understanding of it yourself. Monitor their work closely to eliminate errors. Lets them know, you trust their work. Tweak work, not redo it. Take responsibility for it. Allow them to learn through mistakes without hurting the output. 6. Be their Voice : Be open with your appreciation about your team to others. Support them. Don’t criticize them in front of others. Let your senior know their achievements. 7. Allow them to outgrow your team: Holding back people only diminishes their productivity. If your team member has outgrown your team requirements then, find them a suitable position in a bigger team or promote them. A managers role is to continuously train manpower and help them to grow within the organization. Create other leaders like you. Give them higher responsibilities. It reduces your time and effort. 8. Lastly, be unbiased: Treat all your team members alike. Appreciate good work. Don’t have favoritism. Learn to let go of unsuitable members gracefully. This is just the tip of an iceberg in management. There are several good books one can learn from. I suggest “First Break all the Rules, by Marcus Buckingham” and “High Output Management, by Andrew.S.Grove”"},{"prompt":"Who are the best Canadian immigration consultants in Chennai?","completion":"Croyez Immigration is really good.

I did IELTS for almost 4 times and the last trial was successful with Listening-8, Reading- 7, Speaking -7.5 and Writing - 7. I got a score of 432 CRS and i submitted my profile and waited for almost 5 months. I asked them to submit my application for Ontario but they delayed and I missed a draw which was 431 for OINP. I got upset and discontinued my process with them. My friend from Chennai suggested me to meet Croyez immigration in Chennai and I explained my previous issue with my application. I also told them that i will become 30 in next 7 months and Ill lose points. They looked into my application and told me that I can get more Points with education as I had Diploma+ bachelors. And Diploma+ bachelors will get more points. I sent my Diploma again to WES and got it approved for a double bachelors points which is equal to Masters. To my surprise the points increased to 465 and I got my invite when the draw came to 461. Starting from my PCC and MCC, everything was guided by them properly.

My first inclination was to think it would drop due to the insane back and forth between players and owners, which likely cost them 40–60 games. That created a lot of bad mojo with the fans. But I think the fact that there is so little in the way of normalcy will work to baseball’s favor. As well, I think the short season will also help. They’ll only play a bit over 2 months. With the season being so compact, it will create a lot more intrigue because it will end right after it starts - there is no time to hit a skid. And it could bring even some of the lesser teams into play because you only need to have a hot couple of weeks to be in contention. For that reason, I think people will pay attention baseball, maybe even more than normal. Even a casual fan can pay attention and stay attentive for a season that is 1/3 it’s normal length."},{"prompt":"am 15 years old.

If not, do you know anyone who does and would help you for free or for a small price? If so, start from there. In other situations (it would be expensive to make in time or money, you don’t know how, and nobody you know does) reevaluate the importance of this idea to you. If you decide that you really like it, acquire the skills. Investors aren’t going to pop out of nowhere, so you need to have a solid base and a truly great idea if you want a lot of attention. Good luck!"},{"prompt":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school? Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"Public school teachers are, for the most part, paid fairly. (< 100k is not a king’s ransom in NYC, LA or Chicago, though it will get you by in decent style. Ditto for 50k in rural America where a nice, spacious, 3BR home can be had for less than 150k, and in some regions A LOT less) Given the fact that Mr. Bates and I have had our differences (so much so that he's opted to block me from commenting on his posts), I'm loath to rip private school teachers a new one for fear it'll come off as petty (or worse, insincere). But since, as was pointed out by someone I suspect Mr. Bates greatly admires, “the facts don't care about your feelings\\", here are a few facts: 1: The bar rests pretty high for a teaching position at the vast majority of public schools, and it applies to all applicants. To wit, though a good connection will frequently serve as a tiebreaker, it doesn't provide any actual points. Though a battle between two identical candidates might - nah, will - often be settled by the fact that one has more (or more influential) friends in high places, those friends won't be enough to propel the applicant with a Bachelor's ahead of his rival with a Master's. The faculty at the public high school at which I taught boasted two PhDs and four EdDs among its staff. Of the remainder, 100% either had, or were actively pursuing a graduate degree. Conversely, the total number of PhDs and EdDs at the two private schools at which I taught was zero, and the majority neither had not were pursuing a graduate degree. To be fair, when the first school implemented a tuition reimbursement policy there was a stampede to the nearby college. Hey, post graduate degrees are expensive, and of limited value to a teacher at a private school. (As best I can recall, teachers with a Master's earned a little over 10% more than their counterparts - i.e., enough to pay for your morning trip to Starbucks, assuming you chose a basic coffee, not one of their exotic beverages) * * The bar for a teaching position at all but a select few private schools is for all intents and purposes nonexistent. Please note: I have no cause to doubt that the vast majority of teachers at private school teachers are highly credentialed; my point is that the few that aren't serve to all but guarantee that salaries will be far lower at private schools than at public ones. (\\"Your C.V. is extremely impressive, and your salary request is wholly in line with your credentials. The thing is, I just interviewed a candidate who'll do the job for half what your seeking. Sorry\\".) Supply and demand coupled with a rigid \\"nobody worse than \\"x\\" works here policy is why private school teachers earn less money than public school teachers. Or, we can borrow from Mr. Bate's analogy and label public school teachers \\"limousines\\", and private school teachers \\"the subway\\". If you've ever been to Europe, Canada, or Asia, you know that the bottom rung of the limo ladder is inferior to the top rung of the subway ladder both in terms of opulence and convenience. That said, he typical limo blows the typical subway out of the water."},{"prompt":"What industries need lead generation and marketing?","completion":"My agency does lead generation campaigns for very diverse industries. These include giant software companies, education franchises and dynamic startups. It is easier to answer what industries do not need lead generation. We do a number of public awareness campaigns. For these projects there is nothing to sell. We just want to disseminate information, so the goals are very different. But this still needs marketing. Industries that probably don’t need any marketing at all either are totally sales driven or have a product or service that is in such demand that they don’t need any promotion. Typically necessities will little competition are in this category. Your local pharmacy might be an example. Or your local electricity company, though even these industries have more competition lately. Industries that have traditionally been sales driven are an interesting topic. We have lots of clients who are in this category. Often they are B2B software companies. Their whole new business pipeline has been based around their sales team. But exactly these kind of companies are finding this increasingly difficult. What in earlier times was the job of sales now becoming the job of marketing, so if their marketing is not up to scale, they are losing business to competitors who do it better. It is a big change management process for many of these companies.

Before I even got there, I had decided that I would eat nothing but authentic Vietnamese food, AND that street food would be a huge part of it. Every day, I went out at night, and sometimes during the day when time allowed, to find eating places that I had identified in my research. At times, I would take recommendations from the hotel concierge. With all this effort going into my brief culinary journey, I was rewarded with one of the most satisfying food experience ever in any foreign country. I roamed the Old Quarter and its alleyways, some that were no more than 3 feet wide, and ate as many different dishes I could, sitting on stools that were no more than 18 inches high, sharing tables with fellow strangers, and using chopsticks with the dexterity of a native. What did I enjoy about it? This is Bun Cha, a famous Hanoi dish. At lower left, is a bowl of spiced grilled pork meatballs (it could be pork pieces too). At lower right, is a bowl of steaming fish broth made with herbs, spices, chili peppers and simmered for hours throughout the day. At upper right, is a bowl of fine rice noodles, and next to it is a large bowl overladen with fresh cilantro, fresh mint, and a couple of other fresh herbs. Slices of fresh cucumber may be part of it too. So what makes this dish so tasty? For me, it was how it is eaten and what that does to the whole experience. You take a piece of pork and dunk it in the broth. Then you take a chopstick full of noodles and put that in the broth too. Finally, you take a bunch of fresh greens and place them in the broth. Now with your chopsticks, you take hold of the pork, a bunch of noodles, and the greens, and don’t forget the red chili peppers-all in one go-lower your face to the bowl, and eat it. The flavors of pork and the broth were good, very, very good. But what blew me away was the presence of a bunch of aromatic, fresh greens in the mouthful that added a fabulous dimension to the texture combination, not to mention the flavor of fresh, uncooked herbs. Taken together, everything just exploded in my mouth, and I did not put my chopsticks down until I had finished it all. The second thing I liked about eating in Hanoi was WHERE I ate it. I ate it in little stalls, in deep alleyways, and sitting on tiny stools. Everybody around me was doing the same thing, and enjoying it without any inhibition. The ambiance and the energy added to the taste in no less measure. Another of my Hanoi favorites was Cha Ca (below). About that, another time. Edit: How could I forget Vietnamese coffee? One of the finest I have had. Vietnam is the second largest coffee producer in the world, after Brazil, and produces the Robusta kind of coffee. The other sort in the world is Arabica, with which most of the world is familiar. I loved Vietnamese coffee so much that I bought two packs of these: To enjoy Vietnamese coffee, one has to make it Vietnamese style, using a special filter. This is a single serve maker: This is now my absolute favorite type of coffee to enjoy. It is strong, robust, flavorful, and extremely satisfying. No, no one paid me to write this. I just liked it so much! Edit 2: And finally, on my last morning in Hanoi, I had for breakfast, this: This is banh cuon, thin rice crepes filled with ground pork, mushrooms, and seasonings. It is typically served with thick slices of Vietnamese ham (cha lua) and a tart and spicy dipping sauce (nuoc cham). Grab crepe roll with chopsticks, add a few basil leaves, dip, and bite.

It was night time and there were no one on the streets so I asked him to let's have a walk. We walked the lanes at midnight under the nightsky full of stars. After we came back to the parked bike it was quite late so he decided to leave so we again hugged and he started his bike and drove about 50m and stopped.Thats when he turned around and said “can I have another hug please ? “ So he came back to me hugged and said “Don't move I'm not getting this till the next Saturday“ He came back hugged me tight for the next 2 minutes and then left.

It depends on the scenario: (is it common to have friendly squirrels come up to you in area?) And it just happen to bite/scratch you? ==== OR====Did you trap it and in the process of handling got bitten/scratched? ONLY YOU CAN BE CERTAIN how this all came about, the WHY/HOW you came into contact with it. ^^^ PLEASE REFLECT ON WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED and if you told the Doctor EXACTLY how this all came about- EVERY DETAIL! SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE THE PROPER JUDGMENT CALL. Like YOU, I was advised to not get the shots. Had several visits to the ER, One of these visits i had a room full of professionals tell me I was fine. Still I had no peace of mind. All this over a 10 day period.. Well, I FINALLY started my Anti-Rabies Vaccine. Turns out many AMERICAN doctors know “somewhat” about Rabies.. the “basics\\" but not the minor protocal details listed on the CDC website> which can have MAJOR consequences if not followed exactly. This is not their fault really be ause its just less common in the States.. but because I pointed this small exception out to them, we started the vaccine right away to be safe AND for my “peace of mind\\". If you are not satisfied with what the drs tell you, if it still does not give you peace of mind.. then just go to the ER for a second opinion and explain to them how you FEEL about it.

I would like to take a piano lesson but its expensive.","completion":"Much music for student pianists already comes with at least some suggested fingering. This is something that works, but it is not necessary to use only that fingering if you find another method is more comfortable for you. It is necessary that you would have enough fingers available to complete the phrase, and tucking your thumb under at suitable spots will allow you to do that. Occasionally, it may suffice to change the finger without playing the note a second time. If you have rests, you can use them as suitable spots to life your hand and reposition it where you will have enough fingers where you need them to play the next notes. Practicing scales carefully will get you used to tucking your thumb under and using better fingering, especially scales starting on black notes. But if you are a beginner, master the scales starting on the white notes first."},{"prompt":"What do you think about Chelsea Clinton saying she may run for elected office in the future?

People claim the writing sucks, the characters are silly, the story is lame.....well I am here to tell you that THEY ARE ALL WRONG!!!! The Flash is awesome! With only one season down it's proved it is a force to be reckoned with! It's got an amazing cast, incredible stories, visual effects, acting, cinematography. Season 1 is in my honest opinion the BEST LIVE ACTION SUPER HERO ADAPTATION EVER! A lot of the reviews on here say the Flash is really bad. Like one of the worst shows ever, claiming that the only reason it has a rating over 8/10 is because of fandom.....this isn't true. They are basing their hate of the show on the first few episodes. I can honestly admit that the first few episodes aren't that great, I can admit that. It felt like a mediocre series. However once you hit the mark of Episode 9.....that's when the real fun begins. The stories from there only get more involving, intriguing and overall amazing. The whole Reverse Flash Story is perfectly executed, with plot twists and turns thrown at you nearly every episode. It was hard to see what would happen next! It just kept getting better and better.

First of all, when I ask her if she has any homework, she tells me no, it is all done. To the teacher I reply, “Do you want to know what I hear from her? ‘Mommy, guess what. I got to stay in from recess today!’ “ She didn’t want to go outside, so she purposely did not do her homework so she would not be allowed to go out. I told the teacher she was inadvertently rewarding her by keeping her in from recess. The teacher and I agreed we would need to come up with a new reward/punishment system for Sally. There would be no opting out of recess. And since Sally was an excellent reader and she actually loved reading aloud to the class, the teacher suggested rewarding each full week of completing her homework assignments by allowing Sally to read a story to the class on Friday afternoons.

In addition, POS (Point of Sale) services are available nationwide, meaning visitors can pay by credit card at most hotels and handicrafts stores But it’s better to carry cash. Banking Financial institutions in Bhutan have been greatly enhanced and today we have a number of banks that cater to the needs of the people. Some of the banks that you can avail of while in Bhutan are the Bank of Bhutan Limited, the Bhutan National Bank, the Druk PNB and the Tashi Bank. Traveller’s cheque can be easily withdrawn and exchanged for local currency. Many of these banks provide internet banking facilities. Electricity All major towns are well connected with electricity that runs on 220/240 volts with round hole two-pin and three-pin power outlets. It is recommended that you bring flat-to-round pin converters for your electronics if necessary, however, most hotels offer multi plug sockets. Bhutan is a carbon neutral destination. Our energy is clean and green generated by hydro power. Photography Bhutan offers immense opportunities for photography especially during outdoor sightseeing trips. However you should check with your guide before taking pictures or filming inside Dzongs, temples, monasteries and religious institutions as in some area photograph/filming is not permitted. You are free to capture images of the landscape, the panoramic views of the mountain ranges, rural life, flora and fauna, distinctive Bhutanese architecture and the exterior of Dzongs and Chortens. Shopping Some popular handicraft items available for purchase are hand-woven textiles of raw silk or silk, carved masks of various animals, woven baskets of cane and bamboo, wooden bowls known as Dapas, handmade paper products or finely crafted goods of silver. Other items you may be interested in are the exquisite Buddhist thangkha paintings or Bhutan’s wide array of colourful and creative postage stamps.

Gratuities Tipping is a purely personal matter. We leave it up to you as to whether you want to give a gratuity to your guides and drivers.

Most hotels and cafe’s offer Wi-Fi internet access. Bhutan has a comprehensive mobile (cell) phone network with global roaming also accessable. Clothes & Other Paraphernalia With great altitudinal variations, weather is quite mixed in Bhutan. So be prepared to face the unforeseen weather conditions. We expect visitors to dress modestly and respectfully especially if you are planning a visit to the monasteries, Dzongs and other religious institutions.

So when House Democrats Thursday night released a [LINKED_TEXT: trove of explosive text exchanges] [URL: https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=714] between top U.S. diplomats, it definitely provided a closer look into Donald Trump's months-long effort to pressure Ukraine's leader to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

Mumbai has only 1.1 square meters of open space per person. Either way, that’s less per person than in New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Mexico City and, yes, even Tokyo, making Mumbai not only one of the densest, but also the most cramped city in the world.(It’s not the same) 2. Mumbai has a coastline of over 149 kilometers It may not look true but with its oceanfront beaches, stunning black rock outcrops leafy mangroves, wetlands, rivers and creeks, Mumbai surely has a long shoreline. 3. The name Mumbai was derived from Mumba Devi and Bombay from… From Bom Bahia, literally meaning ‘The Good Bay’. Bombay was actually named by Portuguese explorer Francis Almeida. The present day name ‘Mumbai’ is named after goddess Mumba devi of the Koli community. 4. Mumbai initiated the first of many amenities in the whole of India The Juhu Aerodrome was the first airport of India, the Taj Mahal Hotel, founded in 1903, is India’s first 5 star hotel and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) railway station is the first railway station in India. 5. The Dabbahwallahs’ century-old delivery system is recognised as one of the best managed supply chains in the world. Forbes magazine awarded the dabbawalah network with its highest rating, Sigma Six—a rating that is shared with corporate giants like General Electric and Motorola, it signifies less than one error per one million transactions. 6. India’s first—and now most outdated—electric rail system. Instead of receiving electricity from a third rail, Mumbai is powered by miles of wire that run above the tracks, carrying electricity through a complex network of substations. This DC system was installed far back in 1925. 7. ‘Super Dense Crush Load’- A official term to describe what happens during rush hour in Mumbai Mumbai trains were built to hold 1700 passengers, but they often carry three times that number, leading to such notorious crowding that railways have given peak hours a special name: the ‘Super Dense Crush Load’ 8. Central Park – Khargar (Navi Mumbai is the largest park in Asia and the third largest in the world) The park has more than 35,000 [LINKED_TEXT: sq.mt] [URL: http://sq.mt/]. of green area, and more than 26,000 [LINKED_TEXT: sq.mt] [URL: http://sq.mt/]. space for the children’s play area. On entering the park, the first thing that catches the eye is a grassy green hill side. At first glance, it looks like the edge of a water holding pond or an artificial lake, but that is not the case. It’s the outer periphery of a very large open air amphitheatre. 9. India’s largest and only international standard theme park, Adlabs Imagica, is in Khopoli near Mumbai. 10. ‘Bombay’ is actually a set of 7 islands. The erstwhile ‘Bombay’, which is actually a set of seven islands, was not part of the British Empire but was given as dowry by the Portuguese when Princess Braganza married Charles II of England. It took 60 years to merge the seven islands of Bombay into one landmass between 1784 and 1845. 11. Mumbai doesn’t just have the largest slum in Asia but the most expensive one. Mumbai doesn’t just have the largest slum in Asia, but probably the most expensive one also. To build a house in Dharavi could cost more than a whooping three lakhs! 12. The names of places in Mumbai are mostly very ironic! The Churchgate railway station in Mumbai neither has a gate nor a church. Other places that have ironic names are ; Victoria Terminus – where Queen Victoria never resided, Mahalaxmi Temple – located in Haji Ali, Lohaar Chawl – has no iron-smiths in the vicinity, Breach Candy – where there is a hospital but no candies, Bhendi Bazaar area – that has nothing to do with bhindis (okra)! 13. Mumbai Police’s elite commando force, which is a specialised counter terrorism unit to guard the Mumbai metropolitan area, is called Force One Ajmal Kasab, who killed more than 50 people in the heinous 26/11 attacks in Mumbai has a case registered by the Mumbai police for entering CST station without a ticket. 14. Many famous writers of the world born in Mumbai Nobel Laureate Rudyard Kipling who wrote Kim and The Jungle Book was born in Mumbai. Even Gregory David Roberts and Salman Rushdie are Mumbaikars. 15. The letter ‘B’ in Bollywood is derived from the city’s old name Bombay Bollywood is one of the largest film producers in India and one of the largest centers of film production in the world. In reality, the Hindi Film cinema is the core of Bollywood.

Could that be why Thanos broke it so easily?","completion":"Tony gave him back his original shield. It only beike because Thanos hit it repeatedly on its edge, not square into its center. The weapon he was using, the diuble edge sword, was hinted at by the direcrors to be Asgardian. This means it is made of Uru, the same metal used to forge Mjolnir and Stormbreaker. It is not only strong but probably forged at Nidavilir and emvued with some magic. All of this on top of the fact that we know Vibranium is the toughest material on Earth (so far…). That does not mean it is the strongest material anywhere in the universe. Remeber, Cap used it in battle to deflect attacks from Thanos as well as perform combinations in tandem with Mjolnir while he had the power of Thor. A simple steel shield would have at the very least been dented due to all of this punishment. Captsin America would also know it was a fake as soon as he picked it up. He had been using the weapon for every fight he was in up until the end of Civil War. The weight and density alone would have let him kbow it was genuine. It would have been useless as a peace offering, as Stark intended. All of this leads me to believe the shield he was using is 100% real and Thanos simply broke it.

The cost savings your company will enjoy will be one of the biggest perks but remember also that your sales reps will have a better work/life balance. You’re also selling in such a way that matches today’s customer preferences. Before you embark on this different kind of selling, make sure you’ve equipped every member on your sales team with these tools. APPS FOR PRODUCTIVITY Since inside sales are mostly done remotely, that means you won’t necessarily be able to manage every last sales member’s progress. Productivity apps can fill in the blanks so you can ensure everyone stays on task. [LINKED_TEXT: Slack] [URL: https://slack.com/] is one such good app that lets you check in with your sales team members anytime. With Slack, you can message in real-time, create hashtagged channels for keeping current projects separated from closed ones, send files instantly, and call anyone on your sales team when you need to speak to them. You can also try [LINKED_TEXT: Focus] [URL: https://heyfocus.com/] for your inside sales representatives. This productivity app for Mac users blocks access to websites that waste time, from YouTube to Reddit. You choose which sites are inaccessible, and you can change that list anytime. Focus works for Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome Internet browsers. REPORTING DASHBOARDS AND TOOLS These may be included in your [LINKED_TEXT: customer relationship management software or CRM] [URL: https://www.engagebay.com/products/crm] (more on that in the next section), but if not, then you need a dedicated reporting dashboard. This is part of a workable sales process, as you can [LINKED_TEXT: track important metrics] [URL: https://www.engagebay.com/crm/crm-metrics] like products/services sold, deals closed, deals lost, leads converted, website traffic, social traffic, and more. We just wrote a great post on [LINKED_TEXT: sales analyses] [URL: https://www.engagebay.com/blog/sales-analysis/] that will really come in handy as you begin using sales tools. You can learn which metrics to study for greater sales success, then keep track of these on your sales dashboard going forward. EMAIL TRACKING SOFTWARE Compared to an outside sales rep, your inside sellers will use email much more often. A [LINKED_TEXT: McKinsey & Company] [URL: http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-social-economy] report says that the average inside sales rep dedicates 28 percent of their average day with writing and reading emails, which is significant. With so much riding on these emails, it helps to use an email tracking software. This software tells the sales rep when the customer or lead opens their email, what time that happened, and if they downloaded any files. Through this [LINKED_TEXT: email tracking software] [URL: https://www.engagebay.com/products/email-tracker], your busy sales reps will get reminders that will tell them to follow up. These timely reminders ensure that no customers or potential customers slip through the cracks. SOCIAL SELLING TOOLS Embracing the potential of remote work, your inside sales team should certainly have social selling tools at the ready. What is social selling, you might be asking? With social selling, the sales rep uses social platforms such as Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn as well as offline measures to build relationships with prospective customers. Yes, this is right in an inside seller’s wheelhouse, that’s for sure. The use of social selling tools also allows the sales rep to learn more about the lead or customer’s demographics, shopping behaviors, and preferences/interests. The rep can then create a tailored selling approach that’s more likely to appeal to the customer. WHY IS CRM NECESSARY FOR INSIDE SALES? The most important tool of all is inside [LINKED_TEXT: sales CRM] [URL: https://www.engagebay.com/crm/sales-crm], so of course, we saved the best for last. Yes, that’s one more tool you need, but here is the multitude of reasons it’s so very important that your inside sales team use CRM. LEAD GENERATION AND MANAGEMENT Once your sales team converts customers, they should always aim to convert more. Rather than pick up the phone and cold call people like inside selling used to mandate, today, you can gather leads through your CRM and segment them into tailored groups. With lead scoring, you can also weed out those leads who are not as qualified and thus aren’t worth your time (and vice-versa). Organizing your leads becomes so much easier and more efficient through a [LINKED_TEXT: CRM’s 360-degree customer view] [URL: https://www.engagebay.com/crm/360-degree-customer-view]. You’ll also rely on this view for [LINKED_TEXT: lead management] [URL: https://www.engagebay.com/crm/lead-management-software], where you track where a lead is on your company’s sales funnel and how they’re progressing over time. If a lead has dropped off, converted, or become a loyal customer, you want to know so you can alert your sales team. CRM makes it possible. TELECALLING Telecalling within your CRM is undoubtedly one of the best features for inside sellers. Now your sales team can review information on leads ahead of the call, keep this information handy as they chat, and even get recorded transcripts of the interaction through CRM. This conversation log gets added to a lead or [LINKED_TEXT: customer’s profile] [URL: https://www.engagebay.com/blog/customer-profile/] with any other past instances of communications. Should another sales rep get assigned to this same customer sometime in the future, they’ll have all the info they need to get up to speed and continue prioritizing this customer’s satisfaction. Image: Trinity OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT Finding sales opportunities can be a time-consuming venture, and as we said earlier, anything your sales reps do outside of sales is losing your company money. Thus, by segmenting and organizing data within your CRM, it’s possible to quickly identify opportunities that might not have otherwise been apparent. AUTOMATED FOLLOW-UP REMINDERS If your inside sales reps are successful, then they should have a bevy of customers and leads they deal with at any one given time. While this is great, what’s not as great is forgetting to follow up with a lead or several because your sales rep got bogged down with other work. But hey, we’re all human and it happens. Luckily, sales CRM can prevent these kinds of incidents with automated follow-up reminders. The software will ensure your sales reps always get in touch with the right parties at just the ideal time to keep the professional relationship moving along swimmingly. RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT That’s not the only use of CRM for inside sales [LINKED_TEXT: relationship management] [URL: https://www.engagebay.com/blog/relationship-marketing/]. As in the examples above, when a sales rep has all the information gathered on a lead or customer, such as through a CRM, there’s much less guesswork to their sales approach. They can learn about this customer’s nuances, including interests, hobbies, income, likes and dislikes, and pain points. This kind of personalized, target approach is the one sturdy, lasting professional relationships are made of. ANALYTICS How well your sales team is performing will also have no guesswork with the detailed reporting and analytics present in your CRM. You can track your most crucial KPIs as often or as seldom as makes sense to your business, gaining full insights into the success of your individual inside sales reps and the sales team as a whole. HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT INSIDE SALES SOFTWARE FOR YOUR BUSINESS As you begin digging into your inside [LINKED_TEXT: sales software] [URL: https://www.engagebay.com/products/sales] options, you may be surprised to find so many. Before you get overwhelmed by so many choices, allow us to share some information that should make your decision easier. OPT FOR CUSTOMIZABLE SOFTWARE Considering the scalability of your company is always recommended whenever you buy any new software or solution. If the software won’t grow as your business does, then it’s not the right fit. Customizable CRMs and other sales software can be scalable to match your exact company growth, from the addition of new sales team staff to more customers. This is undoubtedly what you want in your sales software. MOBILE ACCESS Your outside sales reps must be able to access the software between expos, and your inside sales reps also need to be able to get into the software when they’re working remotely or at the office. Thus, software with a mobile or remote component is a must. EASE OF USE A low learning curve is preferable when investing in new software. You’re trying to make your sales team job more efficient, so hoisting upon them a difficult-to-use software will achieve the opposite effect. By trying a month-long demo of the software, as many such solutions offer, you and your sales reps can get a feel for the software. This will tell you how likely your sales team is to use the software each day. EXEMPLARY SUPPORT When something goes wrong, who can you call? How quickly will they get back to you? Time is money, and in sales, the speed and timing of your reps are everything. If they wait too long to get back to a customer, that could lead to a missed deal. A speedy, friendly, knowledgeable support staff won’t leave your company offline for too long when you need your software up and running."},{"prompt":"After losing everything that you own, what would you do?","completion":"The student loses things having a very big school and asks the parents for the things.

Start with the dirtiest room. Attack the cleaning that will have the most impact first, and you should be able to get into the groove pretty quickly. Now move on to the second dirtiest room and do the same thing. Do this enough, and you’ll end up with a clean house. You can’t clean something you can’t see. Before you start loading up with rags and cleaning supplies, go through your place and pick up anything that doesn’t belong where it is and put it where it should go. Not only will you have easier access to all the things you need to clean, but the job as a whole won’t seem so daunting when you get rid of the clutter. You have to arm yourself with the right cleaning tools before you get started. Find a tote or some other container you can carry from room to room to make sure you have everything you need to start scrubbing and wiping. You can stock your tote with sprays, microfiber cloths and other cleaning tools, so you can clean each room efficiently. After you’ve sprayed the surface you’re cleaning with the appropriate solution, let it sit for a few minutes before you scrub. In the meantime, move on to another cleaning task. When you come back, you won’t have to scrub as hard to get things cleaned. Most men enjoy competing. A great way to approach your cleaning tasks is to make it a sort of competition. When you approach cleaning as a fun challenge, you’ll be amazed at how much cleaning you can get done. Time yourself when you’re doing your housekeeping chores.

So no retail trader, unless they happen to stumble into material nonpublic information, is knowingly making an informed and targeted bet on a company.

Here are a few tips I give the students in my machine quilting free motion classes: Smoothness of stitch line depends on a balance of machine speed and the speed with which you move your project under the needle. Practice to find this - generally I find to run your machine at a rather fast speed and move your arms smoothly and consistently at about 50% of that. Always stop with the needle in the project. Regarding stopping and starting: when starting a stitching line while free motion quilting, always pull up the bobbin thread to the top of the project and hold both threads with gentle tension as you stitch in place a few stitches, then proceed to your quilting speed. Starting right up at a high speed will usually result in jagged uneven stitches. Stitching in place first will help in avoiding this as well as locking your stitches. When free motion quilting, one only has the distance of one’s arms to work with. In other words only quilt the comfortable distance you can reach as you direct your project under the needle. If you strain to extend the reach of your arms it usually results in crooked or misshapen lines or patterns. Practice stopping when you feel less control of the project, stopping with the needle in the fabric, re- setting the project and your arm position , locking your stitches if necessary, and then continuing."},{"prompt":"Before legalization, what did people think zig zags were used for?","completion":"Actually people rolled their own tobacco cigarettes at one time."},{"prompt":"What is the purpose of a university education? Is it primarily to learn or to acquire credentials for a future job?","completion":"In past ages, there was often much debate about the relative merits of the vita activa and the vita contemplativa — that is to say, the active and contemplative lives. Modern capitalism does not permit any but the rich to pursue the latter without censure or disruption. But too much emphasis, these days, is focused on doing, and too little on the self that does (and thinks, and feels, and sees, and suffers, and loves, and grieves, etc.). This is why I am among those hoping for the AI singularity young friends of mine like [LINKED_TEXT: Andrew] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Andrew-7696] and [LINKED_TEXT: Horatio Oswald] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Horatio-Oswald] talk about. As Tom, an entrepreneur already (hey, want to hire an old fart?), says, automation and AI will, in the none-too-distant future, almost certainly require the establishment of a basic income for all citizens — there will not be enough labor to go around. And this, I hope, will encourage at least some citizens to rediscover literate culture, civic consciousness and engagement, and other attributes the bygone world rightly considered virtues. Ad interim, I think that university education exists, ideally if not always in practice, to cater to both needs: it must provide students with a “skill set” (repulsive phrase) they can use in the professional world, lest they find themselves poor and indigent. But it is, or should be, the goal of every professor to expand the mind of his or her charges, and, with enthusiasm, passion, and clarity of exposition, to inculcate in students a sense of wonder at all the many areas of inquiry appurtenant to our species. When I was teaching, I did things like make an engineering major decide to double-major in English; I did this by teaching both the mechanics and critical thinking skills required for really reading poetry, drama, and prose (i.e., revealing by demonstration and maieutic exercises what literature does to and for the mind, and how little this ultimately has to do with plots, gists, and the like) and by insisting that literature, and all topics in the humanities, are profoundly tied to the human project also expressed in the sciences. I would argue that the university aims to shape professionals, yes, but that its highest calling is to shape well-rounded persons who recognize that all areas of human inquiry are part of a giant and beautiful picture. STEM and humanities are NOT enemies; only recently, in historical time, have we begun “tracking” students toward one or the other. Descartes was a geometrician (we all know about Cartesian planes) and a founder of modern philosophy (we all know cogito ergo sum, “I think, therefore I am”). Aristotle was a biologist, a logician, a physicist, a meteorologist, an ethicist, a political theorist, a teacher of rhetoric and poetics, and a lot more. The traditional breakdown of knowledges into the [LINKED_TEXT: trivium ] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium]and [LINKED_TEXT: quadrivium] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium] needs, badly, to make its return to our modern lifeworlds. Universities need to do more to encourage this — and to oversee the process by which this can be accomplished even in the face of the hyper-specialization of subfields within virtually all subjects. There is beauty, liberating discipline, and wonder in everything: in literature, art, and music, in biology, chemistry, and physics, in mathematics, in statistics, in economics, in sociology, anthropology, in every blade of grass — and we get only one go-round on this beautiful world, which contains all of these. Amid such plenitude, how is it possible that we spend so much time just watching people live out fake lives on TV, or playing video games, or reading potboilers? How, amid such riches, can people find themselves consenting to the election of Donald Trump or voting for the Brexit? This is the worst kind of waste. The university I taught at for a dozen years strumpeted itself in the worst way, selling out its Ivy-level academic rigor to pursue the golden calf of sports; it pays athletic coaches more than it pays any faculty member. I am a great advocate of sana mens in sano corpore, and think athletics worthwhile for health, for camaraderie, for strategic thinking, and much else; Pindar’s epinician odes speak to me, and it brings me great joy to see my son’s burgeoning passion for soccer (sorry, rest of the world: football!). But when the concern of the university becomes fully corporatized, when athletes are forced to adhere to schedules that minimize their chances to excel academically, and are given special breaks that are at once unfair to non-athletes and to athletes themselves (who are deprived of an education by said “breaks”), something is wrong. When we see pedagogues who care about education outnumbered by administrative douchebags who only want to “monetize” things, we have a crisis on our hands, and one of its manifestations is the collapse of the informed and active citizenry of a free society. At the outset of this crisis, the man who long ago taught me to read poetry was considered a crank; turns out he was a vox clamantis in deserto, and the anguished [LINKED_TEXT: book ] [URL: https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Spoilsport-Fighting-Corruption-University/dp/0271032936/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483547431&sr=8-1&keywords=confessions%20of%20a%20spoilsport]he wrote an indispensable account of the downfall of the university as an instrument and seedbed of social and civic Bildung. Perhaps the Renaissance essayist, scientist (indeed, the founding figure of modern empiricism), and political figure [LINKED_TEXT: Francis Bacon] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon] best sums up the kind of mindset that we ought still, mutatis mutandis for technology and other things, to pursue. Note how much Bacon can say, and in how few words. OF STUDIES STUDIES serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their chief use for delight, is in privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment, and disposition of business. For expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of particulars, one by one; but the general counsels, and the plots and marshalling of affairs, come best, from those that are learned. To spend too much time in studies is sloth; to use them too much for ornament, is affectation; to make judgment wholly by their rules, is the humor of a scholar. They perfect nature, and are perfected by experience: for natural abilities are like natural plants, that need proyning, by study; and studies themselves, do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty men contemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them; for they teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation. Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention. Some books also may be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others; but that would be only in the less important arguments, and the meaner sort of books, else distilled books are like common distilled waters, flashy things. Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man. And therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great memory; if he confer little, he had need have a present wit: and if he read little, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know, that he doth not. Histories make men wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtile; natural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend. Abeunt studia in mores. Nay, there is no stond or impediment in the wit, but may be wrought out by fit studies; like as diseases of the body, may have appropriate exercises. Bowling is good for the stone and reins; shooting for the lungs and breast; gentle walking for the stomach; riding for the head; and the like. So if a man’s wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics; for in demonstrations, if his wit be called away never so little, he must begin again. If his wit be not apt to distinguish or find differences, let him study the Schoolmen; for they are cymini sectores. If he be not apt to beat over matters, and to call up one thing to prove and illustrate another, let him study the lawyers’ cases. So every defect of the mind, may have a special receipt.

I’m actually going to take a slightly more nuanced approach at this, because it might very well depend on what field that person is in, what the circumstances of that lunch are, and what the intentions of the employee might be. The underlying presumption of this question is, I suspect, aimed at the views of Vice President Mike Pence, whose evangelical background leads him to avoid situations where he might be alone in a room with a woman who is not his wife. This rule in evangelical circles comes from the famous evangelist Billy Graham. In the 1940’s, Graham saw that there were a number of very high profile sex scandals involving evangelical ministers taking advantage of their positions with women in their congregations. They would meet for “counseling sessions,” or other 1:1 meetings in private offices, and things would progress from there. These sex scandals utterly destroyed a number of successful evangelical movements and brought whole churches to ruin. Nor was it just sexual impropriety. Ministers fleecing the flocks to finance personally lavish lives is nothing new. Pastors and other religious leaders using their position at the pulpit for publicity or other personal gain is a longstanding problem. And thus, Graham saw transparency as absolutely essential to preventing appearances of impropriety. Graham and several of his associates feared that even the appearance of impropriety would delegitimize the evangelical revival that he was trying to build. They created what would be called the Modesto Manifesto or Billy Graham Rule. While it covered a number of different ways to avoid the appearance of something hinky going on, one of those principles was don’t be alone in a room with a woman who isn’t your wife. Graham himself was not an absolutist on it. For example, he initially turned down a 1:1 meeting with Hillary Clinton until they arranged to have a private conversation in a public restaurant instead. For whatever criticisms anyone had of Billy Graham, not one of them was ever a suggestion that he was anything but on the level about his personal life and private interactions with anyone. Like any rule or principle, when strictly applied without context or regard for the policy behind it, the Billy Graham rule can be taken to absurd results. And that leads to questions like this, which are a reductive application of the rule. Someone following the Billy Graham rule is not going to be rejecting a business lunch in a public setting with a client. They are likely going to be rejecting a private interaction that opens them up to he-said-she-said situations where there are accusations of impropriety that can’t be proven or disproven and leave them open to rumors and whispers about it. As a person who works in a field where the details of divorces pretty routinely come out, I can tell you that “work affairs” are hardly a rarity. Private lunches turn into private dinners turn into sharing hotel rooms on a business trip not infrequently. These things always start in situations behind closed doors. I’ll admit that the Billy Graham rule is a very hetero-normative one, and it’s a product of its time. Still, the underlying goal of “avoid the appearance of any form of impropriety” is a wise one that we reject at our own peril. I am hardly a Pence apologist. But on this one, the more liberal criticisms of Pence’s perspective tend to focus on the rule itself and not the reasons behind it, and mock him on this point unfairly without considering the purpose. So, to answer the question as asked literally: Is this person in a position of trust that could be abused, where being in a room with that person without anyone else present might potentially open up a whole can of worms? As a former teacher, I can say that we were routinely told never ever ever be in a room alone with a student. Ministry has a similar policy. In that situation, the person’s reasoning as stated in the question is pretty wrong, but the outcome is at least correct. Their reasoning is based on an inarticulate, reduced form of the Billy Graham rule that is focused on strict adherence to the guideline rather than understanding the purpose and principle behind the rule. I would correct that reasoning. If we’re just talking about meeting a client for lunch in a public place with others around, that employee probably does not have a legitimate point, and I’d point that out to the employee. If the person’s idea of morality is such that they simply don’t think they ought to interact with a member of the opposite sex that is not their wife, that’s simply an incongruous view with the expectations of a normal society and it certainly isn’t what Graham had in mind. That’s just straight misogyny, and there’s no place in any business I would run for such a view. But if the employee was trying to avoid being put in a position where there could be an appearance of impropriety? That’s a good employee. Redirect the underlying assumptions and have that person keep the right desire. Edit and Addendum: Several commenters have been missing the point sufficiently that perhaps I wasn’t clear enough. There have been several suggestions that I am unfairly treating all men as unable to help themselves from being predators, or that this doesn’t prevent all impropriety from happening. All of that is quite aside from the point. The underlying principle here is avoid the appearance of impropriety. Emphasis on the appearance. And don’t put yourself in a situation where accusations can be made and it would come down to he-said-she-said (or any comparable variation thereof). How that’s carried out in practice is contextual and nuanced, and I’d rather not sit here and play whack-a-hypo all day long, so I’d appreciate it if that’d stop."},{"prompt":"Why are Malaysia and Indonesia different countries?","completion":"British and Dutch legacy.

If it happens, there may be no survivors on Earth, and the entire human population may become extinct. That may happen sooner rather than later the way things are going with Russia/Ukrane and China thinking about shooting down Starlink satellites and invading Taiwan. If it happened now, there would be no one left. So there’s a sense of urgency. Elon Musk thinks if we had enough humans living somewhere other than Earth it would help ensure the continuation of the human species. He’s also good at building rockets, but he’s not planning to colonize Mars on his own. He wants to push NASA and other space agencies like ESA to look toward the Moon and Mars as possible places for human habitation. His company, SpaceX, is hoping to provide NASA with some of the tools it will need to make that vision a reality. It’s not likely anyone will actually walk on Mars in the next 20 years, but within the next 50 it’s more likely. As for actually being able to have large numbers of people live there for long periods of time, there are a number of serious problems that must first be solved by the various space agencies, using tools both made by governments and by private industries such as SpaceX and Blue Origins. It will have to be a joint venture. Here’s some of the problems preventing human habitation of Mars that must be solved first. The atmosphere on Mars — it’s poisonous to humans and only 1% as dense as Earth’s atmosphere. It’s almost a vacuum. No one could breath Martian atmosphere, so unless there’s a way to generate large amounts of oxygen to replenish the astronauts oxygen tanks, people will suffocate. NASA is testing a technology right now on Mars to generate oxygen from the CO[math]^2[/math] to accomplish this.Gravity. It takes 9 months to travel to Mars. During that travel, astronauts typically lose 1% to 2% of their bone mass per month in microgravity. Arriving on Mars, with only 1/3 the gravity of Earth, will not be sufficient to counter this ongoing bone mass loss.Radiation is much worse than once believed. Without sufficient atmosphere and an organized magnetic field, there’s nothing to shield astronauts from deadly cosmic and solar radiation. A space suit will not be sufficient to counter this radiation, so the majority of time residents of Mars will have to live underground. Some kind of tunneling equipment will have to arrive on Mars long before humans. That happening, if it ever happens, is a long way off. You can’t just load a bulldozer on to a rocket and send it to Mars, and the bulldozer operator will need protection from radiation as well.It gets down to -195[math]^circ[/math]F on Mars. Astronauts will freeze unless in an underground controlled environment.Earth and Mars become aligned on the same side of the Sun once every 2 years, so there would be no return flight for 2 years. NASA has recently released a study based on Musk’s proposal to “nuke” the poles. Elon Musk, thinking out loud, proposed there’s enough frozen carbon dioxide at the Martian poles, if you detonate a nuclear bomb there it will cause a greenhouse gas effect and warm the planet. NASA thought the idea had merits and set out to study the concept. The scientists NASA employed in this study have concluded there’s not enough water and CO[math]^2[/math] at the poles for this to work. It seemed like a good idea before we had enough data. Now that the data is in, this idea will be put to rest. Musk is an ideas man, but all of his ideas don’t work out the way he wanted.You can’t grow food in the Martian “soil” (technically called “regolith”). The regolith on Mars is full of perchlorates, making growth of plant life impossible. Astronauts need to bring food, water and oxygen for at least 3 years, and if they can’t provide enough for themselves within that 3 years, they will either die or have to leave. Elon Musk isn’t expecting to be the one personally solving these problems. He’s an ideas man who has the money to build tools, but he expects the top international space agencies, including NASA, to attempt to solve some of them. Musk has proposed a timeline when all these factors might come together, but it’s not known if these problems can ever be solved and a colony on Mars is still science fiction at this point in time."},{"prompt":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","completion":"Apple's decision to shift from a computer company to a consumer electronics company: In the late 1990s, Apple shifted its focus from a computer company to a consumer electronics company with the launch of the iPod.

Our class was no noob either. We fixed their seat at middle bench. Firstly they denied to sit but teacher fixed everybody’s seat permanantly. We requested sir to do it and he did it. Nishant’s face turned red in shy and Soni was smiling awkwardly. Ah, the cuteness. He was shy and introvert. She was extremely extrovert. In short, they’re everything we need to call cute and petfect couple. Did I mention that both of them were extremely good in studies. They were always sitting together in class and like every second story it did affect their academics. They were getting better day by day in academics. Even though they were couples they had full concentration on studies. They would help each other in studies, discuss doubts, share notes. Nishant would wake up till late night to study and not to chat. Soni didn’t stop him to talk to other girls or to befriend them. That said, they were very mature. Their maturity was at whole different level. That’s why teacher had no problem with them being couples. Finally, exams were over and they scored exceptionally good marks in board exam. On this my teacher said that it happened because they were made to sit together. They didn’t ruin their focus in class to have a glimpse of each other.They didn’t stalk each other in anyways.They didn’t do any efforts to get attentions.They didn’t waste their time and energy to impress each other. In short, they didn't get distracted. On contrary, they helped each other in studies. Q. What do teenagers wish adults understood? Ans. Maturity doesn't come by age and teens can be mature.

I stumbled upon your intriguing question, \\"How can I control my blood sugar?\\" and I can totally relate to your concern. You see, a couple of years ago, I was facing the same challenge, and boy, it was tough. But let me tell you a little story from my own life that might help you out. Once upon a time, I was leading a fast-paced, hectic life with unhealthy eating habits. I constantly craved sugary snacks and skipped meals, leading to roller-coaster blood sugar levels. It wasn't until a close friend of mine, who happens to be a nutritionist, stepped in with some valuable advice. She told me to focus on a balanced diet with regular meal timings, and that was a game-changer. By incorporating more whole foods like veggies, lean proteins, and complex carbs, my blood sugar levels stabilized, and I felt more energetic and focused throughout the day. Now, based on my experience and expertise, here are some practical tips for you to take control of your blood sugar. First and foremost, make it a priority to eat at regular intervals and avoid skipping meals. This helps keep your blood sugar levels stable and prevents those nasty crashes. Secondly, pay attention to what you eat - try to limit processed foods, sugary treats, and sodas. Instead, opt for whole, nutritious foods that are packed with fiber and nutrients.

I’ve copied the rules below, straight from the National Park Service. However well they are communicated all over Yellowstone, many people choose to interpret them to allow (in their minds) carrying a small dog on boardwalks. It’s not allowed. The reason I see it often every time I’m in the park is due to understaffing and human entitlement/assertiveness, the same reason people park aggressively and inconsiderately. It’s also the same rationale to approaching wild animals too closely and leaving safety paths.

It is the same as when men walked over to Grand Prismatic Spring and bragged about it online in 2016! Bringing a pet to Yellowstone may limit your activities in the park. Protect your pet and park wildlife by observing these regulations: Pets may only accompany people in developed areas and must remain within 100 feet (30.5 meters) of roads, parking areas, and campgrounds.Pets must be physically controlled at all times: they must be in a car, in a crate, or on a leash no more than six feet long.Pets are not allowed on boardwalks, hiking trails, in the backcountry, or in thermal areas.Pets may not be left unattended or tied to an object.Pets may not be left in a situation where food, water, shade, ventilation, and other basic needs are inadequate. Pets may remain in vehicles for short periods of time, but we recommend that someone stay behind to personally ensure their well being.Owners must bag and dispose of pet waste. There are NO EXCEPTIONS to the regulations for carried pets (in arms, carriers, strollers, backpacks, and so forth) in restricted parts of the park. These policies exist to protect pets from being killed by predators like bears and coyotes, to protect them from being burned or killed in hot springs, to prevent the exchange of diseases between domestic animals and park wildlife, and to allow others to enjoy the park without the disruption of pets.

There are 2 rookie mistakes that I have regularly seen - and with a sweeping generalisation, one is typically a ‘female’ rookie mistake and the other is a ‘male’ rookie mistake. [Please note that this is stereotyping, I have seen all genders do both, but the vast majority matches this stereotyping] Typical male mistake: Constantly running the same route/distance pushing harder every time to achieve a faster time.this is a fast track to injury, or (when the improvements stop) disillusionment with runningsolution: mix up the runs and routes. Do all sorts of runs, and make sure that you definitely include easy runs. Typical female mistake: Stopping (not literally - but not pushing harder) because there is some discomfort with breathing etc.this is not a major issue, but does mean that people don’t reach their potential. They just keep ‘plodding’, and wondering why they aren’t improving.it’s difficult to ‘solve’ this - doing speedwork/intervals can help, as long as the runner understands that they need to (even temporarily) ‘push through the pain’ (here pain means discomfort)there are 2 things to point out to runners suffering from this:for most runs, the discomfort that you reach after about 2 minutes of running is the worst that it’s going to be. Don’t back down because that first 2 minutes is hard work, settle into instead.those effortless runners that just seem to glide past? They suffer the same discomfort as well, they’ve just understood that they can accept it."},{"prompt":"What program do photographers use to edit photos?","completion":"Adobe Photoshop is one of the best professional photo editing software that are available online and can be used if you're looking for one.

I am not dying I am not going anywhere… I wish I could say SERI and bring him back. Watching Dil Bechara is a bag of mixed feeling that unlike me everyone must have felt. Sushant Singh Rajput (Late, I hate to tell that) as Manny and Sanjana Sanghvi, making her film debut, as Kizie Basu, takes us through an offbeat romantic journey in Dil Bechara where both the actors battle with cancer. Pinch of pain with laughter, the movie takes us through an emotional ride. Sushant as Manny who dreams of directing a movie, keeps Kizie and us entertained with his little acts of being a flirtatious lover, supporting his best friend when he loses both his eyes due to cancer and takes revenge by throwing eggs at the betrayal to JP. A boy with silly yet not-so-silly feelings win hearts of Kizie’s parents and wishes to fulfill her dream of meeting Abhimanyu at Paris, her favourite singer who lefts a song incomplete. While Manny does all to fulfill Kizie’s dream and their romance blooms at Paris, the story hits an immediate low with Manny feeling the ache again of cancer. Saif Ali as singer, Abhimanyu, with his needless jokes and an unpleasant demeanour somehow speaks of real practicality that neither the two youngsters in love or as audience we were ready. “Khud ko maarna saala illegal hai, toh jeena padta hai [It’s illegal to kill yourself, so you’ve to live].” And when the story preps us for a dying Manny and Sushant, somehow his expressions makes us all feel blurr about the reel and the real actor. My heart cried at the particular scene where his best friend, JP and Kizie gives their funeral speech with his final presence on the screen. A god gifted actor, with brilliant acting skills and expressions, Sushant you will always remain alive in us. But as a fan, I would still wish on one corner of my heart, Comeback!

The visit is still fresh in my mind. Let me share the things which I feel a person will only believe when they visit Mumbai . Safe for women. We were roaming in Marine Drive at around 2 at night and there were many girls/women walking in groups of two or three or even alone wearing short clothes and everyone were minding their own business (not judging here, but describing so that one gets the idea of how free and relatively safer women are here). I cannot imagine the same thing here in Delhi !Girls have freedom to wear and do what they like without being judged and ogled upon. Hats off to people of Mumbai (Mumbaikars ?) for providing this kind of environment ! People here follow queue almost everywhere. It was a shocker for me and my family coming from Delhi to Bombay for the first time. At Bus stops, ticket counters, and people were even standing in queue for taking shared auto, it was such a delight for us.We must have taken around 12–15 auto rides in our short journey of 5 days and all the auto drivers took us by meter, here in Delhi it is difficult to find autos that charge you according to meters. Mostly they will say a fixed amount(which is always higher than meter price) and it is upon the person to bargain and negotiate to bring the cost down. The people of Mumbai are more open/ matured and generally mind their own business. My sister lives there and told us that she was much more comfortable staying and working in Mumbai than Delhi.The architectural structures of Mumbai are exceedingly great. Just awesome- The traffic jams are very very bad, but we did not felt it much as we live in south Delhi where traffic is always bad to extremely bad on any given day. For the people who are visiting Mumbai from a place where there is less/no traffic jams, they will be in for a surprise.Crowd crowd everywhere. The city of Mumbai is crowded like hell and this goes without saying as it is the most populous city in the country with one of the highest population density in the world. Finally the city never seems to sleep and everyone is busy all the time. It was a great experience all in all. I would really wish to visit Mumbai once again If I get a chance for sure.

It is designed to provide excellent support to the back and spine, which can help reduce the risk of developing back pain or other musculoskeletal disorders caused by sitting for prolonged periods. While the Aeron chair is quite expensive, it may be worth the investment if you spend a significant amount of time sitting in your home office and prioritize your long-term health and comfort. Additionally, Herman Miller is known for its high-quality materials and construction, which means that the Aeron chair should last for many years with proper care. That being said, there are also other ergonomic chairs available that may be more affordable than the Aeron chair while still providing excellent support and comfort. Some popular options include the Steelcase Leap, the Haworth Zody, and the Humanscale Freedom.

But do the bottles hold the same amount of wine?","completion":"Yes. Wine (and spirits for that matter) are highly regulated and only vary from the typical (750ml, 1L, 1.5L) volumes by micro milliliters thanks to computer automated filling machines. If you look at a bottle with punt and without you’ll notice very small differences in size of the bottle, fill line, thickness of the glass, etc; this is to offset the slight interior volume differences that a punt might create. “Historically, punts were a function of wine bottles being made by glassblowers. The seam was pushed up to make sure the bottle could stand upright and there wasn't a sharp point of glass on the bottom. It's also thought that the punt added to the bottle's structural integrity.” -Dr. Vinny, Wine Spectator Historically as well when glass was blown instead of pressed into a machine the punt allowed the wine maker to actually create a more consistent interior volume as they could push the punt further into or less far into the depths of the bottle while keeping a consistent exterior look and shape to the bottles. So with today much more automated glass making process a punt is more decorative than necessary."},{"prompt":"Why did Melinda Gates say choosing to divorce Bill was her 'lowest moment?","completion":"Perhaps because she never in her wildest dreams imagined that her husband might be problematic in the way(s) that he was?

If you want to get 5–6% return then you should invest in a gold fund. But, it is still a better option than buying physical gold. When you try to sell physical gold, the value will depreciate up to 10%. That’s why it is the worst advice to buy gold! You can invest in Gold Fund and GOLD ETF fund where you get an advantage in the market. When the gold price goes up, the NAV will increase and when it goes down, the NAV will come down.

It may sound simple, but it's a powerful reminder to be kind, empathetic, and respectful toward others. I once came across a story of a young boy who had trouble making friends at school. His grandmother told him to try treating his classmates the way he would want to be treated. He took her advice and started complimenting his classmates, sharing his snacks, and helping them with their homework. Soon, he made many friends and became known as one of the most generous and friendly students in the school. This advice can apply to all aspects of life, not just making friends. It can help you build better relationships, avoid conflicts, and create a more positive environment around you. It's a timeless piece of advice that has been passed down through generations and has remained relevant today. Another piece of advice that I find interesting is to \\"embrace failure.\\" It's easy to fear failure and to avoid taking risks because we don't want to fail. However, failure is a natural part of life, and it's often the stepping stone to success. If you never fail, it means you're not pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, and you're not learning anything new. I once read about a successful entrepreneur who failed in several businesses before he finally hit it big. He said that each failure taught him valuable lessons that he used to improve his next venture. He embraced failure as a natural part of the journey to success, and it paid off. In conclusion, there's no shortage of great advice out there, but the best advice is the one that resonates with you personally. It's the one that inspires you to be a better person, to take risks, and to keep pushing yourself toward your goals. So keep searching, keep learning, and keep growing. Who knows, maybe one day someone will ask you for your best advice!"},{"prompt":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","completion":"There’s only one of two points I would go back to. The first one is when I first learned about Bitcoin when I was finishing college. At the time not too many people knew about it, the concept of a cryptocurrency wasn’t even fully flushed out yet. This the same time when I first began to take interest in stocks, bonds and simply investing overall. I had around 1,000 that I wanted to invest into something and I was seriously considering putting that money into Bitcoin. The next day, which was about a month or so before graduation some of my friends on campus were having a pick up game of basketball and invited me. Instead, I went to a lecture being held on campus about Bitcoin, the lecturer was talking pretty much about how risky of an investment it was and how the majority of purchases were on the dark web for illegal goods and services. This turned me off of Bitcoin because the lecturer, a technology lawyer believed that the feds would eventually crack down on this and abolish Bitcoin. This all happened about when a single Bitcoin was fluctuating around 80 ¢. That 1,000 back then, would’ve amounted to 81 million today. Knowing what I know now, if I could go back in time, I would’ve never gone to that lecture, pulled the trigger on Bitcoin, and played hoops with my friends. The second point that I would’ve liked to have changed is extremely similar. About a year later after graduating college I began law school. During that year off in between college and law school studied for the LSAT, fortunately got a scholarship, and I made a bit of money working a few minimum wage jobs. I had about 5 thousand dollars set aside that I wanted to invest it in something. This time I was thinking about Tesla, it had IPO’d about a few months earlier and was trading around 20 per share, well before the stock had even split. The girl I was seeing at the time convinced me instead to “invest” that money upgrading my wardrobe instead, according to her all I had were old “grandpa suits.” She was also going to law school with me and said I need to wear more “upper class” or “preppy” looking outfits as I’d probably be going to a lot of fancy dinners, country club events, and the like. I ended up spending 4k on suits, none of which fit by the time I graduated, and I spent another 1,000 on designer polos and khakis. I eventually did invest in Tesla much later, but had I invested that money back then, I’d have close to about 1 million dollars today in Tesla stocks. This isn’t nearly as bad of a miss as my Bitcoin debacle, but it’s still a big miss. If I could go back, I 100% would."},{"prompt":"w is a BSc in geology from AMU?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: https://www.amu.ac.in/departmentpage.jsp?did=4] [URL: https://www.amu.ac.in/departmentpage.jsp?did=4] You will get excellent placement in the field of geology ast it has tremendous scope.

Will many more public companies follow suit?","completion":"Marketing is a very broad discipline. The objective is to sell products or services, which can be accomplished in many different ways with varying effectiveness. One would not advertise industrial cherry pitting machines on broadcast television, but a trade show or trade magazine would be a very effective way of reaching a receptive audience. Media relations has two main objectives. Building relationships (with the media), raising awareness about the product or service (this creating sales opportunities). Elon Musk accomplishes these objectives almost by himself, so there seems little reason to have a large staff who would almost certainly be less effective. Frankly, Tesla’s most effective marketing is implicit in the product design (also a marketing function…) and owner delight with their experience. I want one because my wife and I drove a friends X model (amazing…). I had a similar experience with the Apple watch, which frankly, I didn’t get when it was first released and neither, apparently, did many other people as sales proved disappointing. Yet my wife and I both agree that the watch has become our primary technological interface with our phones acting more like a docking station. Our conversion was once again, the direct result of another user’s delight with the product. For any product or service, it’s a sign of incompetence when a company throws the marketing tools kitchen sink at a product to try to sell it."},{"prompt":"Atheists, take a look around.

I was a boarding school preppy for my last two years of high school. Bad things can happen and the parents will never know about it. If you absolutely must send your kids to a boarding school, be sure that you have a good relationship with them and that they are free to communicate openly with you. They may be afraid to tell you what is happening because they might face retaliation if other students or school personnel found out that they told. If they report bullying or worse, do not blame them. If you do blame them, you will be cutting off communication."},{"prompt":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

Don’t make things more complicated by trying to arrange the perfect romantic dinner, or planning a whole day out. Instead, keep things short and simple. A cup of coffee in a central location will make it clear fast if your date is someone you would like to spend more time with. And if things go well, the coffee could turn into a lunch or dinner, adding some spontaneity into the mix. Don’t stress unnecessarily A bit of anxiety is natural on a first date it’s half the fun. But you’ll want to eliminate the kind of stress that will make you flustered and your date uncomfortable. Remember, the more relaxed you feel, the more comfortable your date will be around you. One simple trick is to sit at a right angle to your date rather than face them directly. This takes the pressure off trying to fill every pause in the conversation, and you can both do a bit of people-watching instead. Cut down the texting, and meet in person The conversation might have started on an app or a website, but it shouldn’t stay there for too long. Texting can certainly give you a sense of another person, but to get to know each other, you need more than messages on a screen: facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice are just as important. So don’t waste time on a virtual relationship – go out there and meet the real person behind the words. Be true to yourself Dating in the 21st century can feel like a competition, and perhaps it has always been that way. But too often we measure our worth against those we perceive to be ‘winning’, with the result that we try to imitate and improve on what others are doing instead of finding our way. But dating shouldn’t be about winners and losers. It’s about finding someone you connect with and care about; someone who makes you happy and who you can make happy in return. This is only possible when you stay true to yourself and let your authenticity shine through. Complete your successful first date with the right follow-up What to do after the first date? So you felt a connection, the conversation flowed and you had lots of things in common. Terrific. Now what? A successful first date is only as good as the follow-up, and this means arranging another meeting. You could do this right away, but it’s probably better not to put someone on the spot."},{"prompt":"w do you know that you have found a true friend?","completion":"In most cases it takes time. You need shared experiences to form a bond and build the unshakable trust that makes the very best friendships last. There’s nobody in my inner circle that I haven’t known for at least ten years. One, my Aunt Jane, I’ve known for my entire life. Another is a girl I met in Kindergarten. We grew up together and never lost touch, even after life pulled us in different directions. True friends expect nothing and give everything. They love you just as you are. As I’ve heard it said: Good friends help you bury the body, great friends bring the shovel, and best friends don’t even ask why there’s a body to bury. If you’re the least bit concerned that your friend would blow your cover, then he or she doesn’t quite qualify as a “true” friend, I’d say. The person may be someone you enjoy spending time with, maybe even a casual friend, but probably not part of your most trusted inner circle. There’s a reason you have to take care not to admit people to the inner circle too soon. I did that recently. It was someone I had romantic feelings for, and in hindsight that clouded my judgment. I overlooked too many warning signs, and things fell apart once I realized there was a trust and truthfulness issue that I thought we’d worked past. We’re still friends, but for my part I’m much more guarded now in that particular relationship than I was. With a true-blue friend, there never would have been any issues to wonder about or work through."},{"prompt":"What do you think of PyTorch compared to TensorFlow?","completion":"I think that 2 or 3 months ago, both libraries were more or less equivalent in terms of power. But in the last times Tensorflow has received so many improvements and pull requests, even there were new frameworks created around it, that I’m not sure anymore they are now equivalent. I think that there should be a common language to express models and networks architectures, because there are many duplicated efforts just to implement the same network. When a paper appears, you begin to see the implementation indifferent frameworks, all wanting to express the same type of neural network architectures. This should change in the future IMO, maybe building language wrappers, or a complete new definition language."},{"prompt":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","completion":"Generally, Customers can expert Best services on Design & Development in Mobile Solutions.

I understand in some cases Assembly beats even compiled code in c and c++, what happen under the hood that makes Assembly code run faster in certain situations?","completion":"It does not. Its a common myth from the 70s when compilers were so horribly inefficient so sometimes programmers were taught to avoid certain language constructions or run some “preprocessors” to convert program to lower-level program in same language. Forty years passed, compilers improved a lot, but myth persists.

To start of with, the first thing the officer in charge should be concerned with during a protracted firefight is logistics. They should not run out of ammo, they should not even run low on ammo. There should be some system set up for either resupply or an escape route. If they have neither, the officer in charge has failed to do their job. If an individual soldier ends up black on ammo (completely out,) their squadmates should share ammo with them. There are reasons both the M4/M16 and the M249 SAW both fire 5.56x45mm ammunition. Ammo sharing is one of them. If the entire squad runs out of ammo with an incompetent officer in charge, they can try to resort to picking up enemy weapons. The first problem this is the location of the enemy’s weapons. Most firefights take place at range; its not like COD where you are shooting people ten feet in front of you. There may be dozens to hundreds of yards of open field between you and the nearest enemy weapon. You would have to cross that distance while being shot at before running all the way back to your squad. If one runs dry during close quarter’s battle, they would be better off switching to their pistol (if they have one,) or backing out of the room. If this happens, it is the result of poor planning; they should have asked for ammo BEFORE kicking in the door. The next problem is questionable maintenance. The gun an enemy died holding could be so worn as to be one round away from blowing up in your face. Alternatively, and less dramatically, it could simply malfunction; jamming up when you need it most. Then there is the issue of fratricide (“friendly” fire.) The human eye tends to zero in on precise threats. If you perceive a spider as a threat, your eyes will focus in on the fangs (actually the pedipalps, the mouth like protrusions a spider’s fangs are located on, but I digress.) Likewise, if you perceive an armed enemy as a threat, and you should, you will focus on his/her weapon. If you are a U.S soldier and you see someone carrying an AK-74, its easy to react (read: shoot) as if s/he were an enemy. But, in this scenario, it turns out you just shot a U.S. Marine armed with a commandeered AK-74. Even the sound of the weapon can contribute to fratricide. Most soldiers never see their enemy; they shoot at the location from which the fire, or sound of gunfire, is coming from. If you are sporting an AK-74, you may very well find yourself being suppressed and/or shot by a friendly soldier carrying an M249 SAW. Finally, there is the danger of booby traps. If the enemy has had time, they can attach a tripwire to a weapon. When you pick up the weapon, you inadvertently set off an IED, potentially killing you in the process (or worse, maiming you, thereby making your squadmates leave cover to save your, now permanently disabled, life and equipment) all while being shot at. This has been done before, wounding an enemy so as to draw his squadmates out of cover to render aid. In my opinion, it is an absolutely despicable tactic (as you can argue the unwounded squadmates are acting as medics and the injuries inflicted will hamper the soldier longer after the war has ended,) but such is the nature of war. Oh, and the enemy’s weapons are likely lower quality than your own. They likely sourced their firearms off the black market, where they sat in dirty, moist warehouses, rusting away for decades before being pressed into service. They are frequently cheaper, less reliable, less accurate, and heavier than what a soldier from a first world country would be carrying."},{"prompt":"ve you left California and if so, why?","completion":"Yes, I left not only California, but US altogether.

Which wasn't true at all. Not even close. The people who told me didn't have a clue as to who their ancestors really were. The way I've since put it together, from the vantage point of having a membership in [LINKED_TEXT: Genealogy, Family Trees & Family History Records] [URL: http://ancestry.com/] (and that is how Quora treats the link to Ancestry), is that over the years and the generations the name “Allen” came to be associated with Ethan Allen. It wasn't. The name, “Allen” belonged to one Lewis Allen, a close compatriot of Daniel Boone. There are 3 surnames that are closely intertwined; Allen, Boone and Morgan. So close were these families that the children of one family were routinely given middle names of one or the other of the families. So Lewis “B.” Allen was actually Lewis Boone Allen. And Daniel “M.” Boone was Daniel Morgan Boone. The same with Sarah B. Allen, whose full name was (drum roll please, because this is where the confusion began): Sarah “Boone” Allen. Who married my 3X great grand pappy. Early in the 19th century Ethan Allen was revered as a real “American Patriot.” A guy who'd organized “The Green Mountain Boys” and fought the British. Someone you actually might wish to be related to. Daniel Boone had earned quite a name for himself by the time he died in 1835, an American folk hero, but Colonel Ethan Allen was already renowned for his Revolutionary War exploits. He even made his own furniture (Sorry. You had to have seen that coming). If they'd actually kept only adequate records they would have been fascinated to know that Ethan Allen pales in comparison to some of their other true ancestors. For instance, Revolutionary War buffs will instantly recognize the name “Brigadier General Daniel Morgan.” He was as much an outdoorsman as Daniel Boone. Like Boone, he'd fought the Indians, studied their war tactics and effectively used this new mode of fighting brilliantly against the British, who thought it all very ungentlemanly. He came to Washington's attention because he was winning and General Washington badly needed a winner. For those who don't recognize the Revolutionary War general think, “The Patriot” movie. Yep. Same guy. Mel Gibson's character was based on Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, who accepted British General Cornwallis’ surrender. And if you follow the Morgan line back a bit further, to Wales in fact, you'll find a very interesting character. Sir Henry Morgan. Wait! You can't be serious? Not that “Sir Henry Morgan,” of all people? Oh, but I am. And now, if you're thinking, “Blackbeard, the Pirate” you're right. And if you're not, then think Johhny Depp, who built his character around the very same British privateer (with a dash of Kieth Richards) who both confounded and terrorized the Spanish Main, ultimately becoming a wealthy landowner and Governor of Jamaica. There you have The Big Lie, as solemnly passed on to me, of which several generations my family spoke reverently of and took as The Gospel Truth. But required only months to unwind and get right. “You're a REAL American, boy!” my Uncle Jack would say. It took awhile for the boy to grow into a man and dispel that one. “We're all real Americans, Uncle Jack. Each one of us. If knowing it somehow made me a better “American” that would be great. But it doesn't. To me it's just an interesting sidebar to my own life. Nothing more.” But if they could have only known the real lineage maybe they would have been even happier about the whole thing.

Not every Australian or New Zealander would dislike something about another & then assume that ALL from that country are similar. Having said that I had wondered how often an Australian comedian had been right when he told Zealanders in the audience that he hoped they really enjoyed the upcoming Christmas in Australia & added… ‘Hurry, hurry, hurry! Only ten shopliftinh days left until Christmas’. Judging by how hilarious most of the audience found the comment to be, it looked surprisingly on target. I had also had two unrelated & brief NZ acquaintences - one of whom exchanged her old shoes for new ones on a shelf & walked out the shop calmly, me after her insisting she return & pay. She stared at me blankly, hailed a taxi & took off alone. The other bragged to me that he had cheated a car & van salesperson out of both & had no intention of paying. Horrific behaviour in the distant past - I assumed that a high percentage of arrivals then were Nz’s runaways - & I can’t say I liked that one bit. These days people can’t be so anonymous, so I doubt if it’s the same now. However I did hear a NZ person say not so long ago that I need not tell a person buying an old car of mine about a hidden motor issue. This person was surprised why I would be open about it, since I would get less for the car. They were stunned when I said I do my best to treat others as fairly as I want to be treated. So, I’m guessing that some ethical standards might be a bit different to Aussies & it’s a good idea to be aware of that potential… but it’s unnecessarily generalising to assume that this issue is true of all people from NZ ."},{"prompt":"Mathematicians, how did you become so exceptionally great at maths?

Long legs are heavy, add stress to the mounts, and are a nightmare to store in a small plane like a fighter. They bent the wings down to get clearance for that huge propeller.

Firstly, unlike many think, abusive relationships are rarely like this, with happiness continuously and rapidly falling flat out over time. They are rather like this Abusive relationships are not abusive every single day. They have their highs and amazing moments occasionally, which you are often blanketed by. Because of this, you don't see the toxicity building up in the relationship. Every time a ‘enough is enough’ point comes, it often is followed by a ‘this is good’ point which gives hope to the person that it is worth giving a shot. Secondly, the sunk cost fallacy in toxic relationships. As I have explained in the other answer, you tend to continue in the relationship because you have already invested a lot of time and energy in it. It happens when you are so attached to the emotions that you forget to think logically, and you are so caught up in the past that you forget to think about the future. Thirdly, toxic optimism. Hope and positivity are not always good. It can cut two ways. Sometimes, you will get what you have wanted and feel like ‘It’s worth the wait.’ Sometimes, you will lose your time and energy in this process and feel like ‘I shouldn’t have done this.’ You continue to be in a toxic relationship because somewhere you have a hope that your partner might change someday, realise your value, respect your feelings and mend their behaviour. But, it might happen or might not happen. Fourthly, fear and low self-esteem. From what I have noticed, after a point of time, people who are victims in a toxic relationship start doubting themselves. They think, ‘Maybe this is how it is everywhere?’ ‘Maybe I am expecting too much.’ ‘Maybe there is a mistake on my side.’ So because of this self-doubt, people develop fear as well that their next relationship might also go through the same way. ‘What if the next partner is worse than this?’ sends shivers down their spines and put them back in the same relationship. Fifthly, society. It is not just about random women in kitty parties or colleagues in offices sharing gossip about divorces. Among peers and friends in college also this is quite common. ‘Oh look at her, she changed her boyfriend again.’ ‘He got a new girlfriend, maybe he cheated on his Ex’ There are people who want to live silently without falling into anyone’s gossip group meetings. They suffer silently and smile outside, solely just to maintain their image of ‘One life. One lover. Jai Shree Ram.’"},{"prompt":"f you had one wish from a genie in a bottle, what would it be?","completion":"I would wish for a cup of tea. The story of Genie and the Millionaire Once upon a time, a millionaire was driving to work in his fancy car. All of a sudden, an old rusty car hits his car hard from the back. Surprized and angry, the millionaire pulls over and gets out to confront the driver. An old white-bearded man appears out of the car and takes the resposibility for the damage: “My bad, son. Couldn’t stop the car in time. You see it got really old; I probably should buy a new car. Anyway, let’s sit and talk. How much do you want for the compensation?” The millionaire looks for a moment at the old man who is wearing torn old clothes, and says: “No, that is okay. I don’t need your money. Just be careful next time”. To which the old man replies: “Who do you think I am?! Some poor old man? Let me show you something” And opens the back of his car; takes out a strange ceramic bottle and starts rubbing it. Moments later, a genie swirls out of the bottle and starts speaking with a loud voice: “I AM THE GENIE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU WISH” The old man proudly looks at the millionaire who is now shaking with fear, and says to the genie: “Make us some tea while we talk about the cost of the damage” Now the millionaire with his business mindset sees the opportunity and offers the old man to buy the genie. After long negotiations, the old man finally agrees to sell the genie for a crazy amount of money. The millionaire goes home and brags to his wife: “I bought a genie and he will make us the richest people in the world” And orders the genie to make their house full of gold, to which the genie says: “I am sorry. But, I can only make tea” P.s. It is a popular story in my country.

C++ is by far the most popular language of choice for competitive programmers due to its speed, and most resources/solutions but many people start with Python or Java too. I would strongly recommend that you first get basics of C, learn the concepts of libraries, flow of control and functions and then switch to C++ and get started with competitive programming. A good first step would be to tackle the [LINKED_TEXT: USACO Training Pages] [URL: https://train.usaco.org/usacogate]. The first few sections cover some basic but very important algorithms such as Greedy, DFS/BFS, binary search, dynamic programming, and more. The training pages have tutorials that you can read on these topics, plus a host of practice problems to hone your skills. This provides you with a structured and organized way of learning the basic algorithms you need in competitive programming. However, one shortcoming of the USACO training pages is that to progress to the next section, you must first successfully solve all problems in the previous section. Sometimes, this can lead to frustration if one difficult problem is blocking your progress, since it does not allow you to view the solutions to a problem until you solve it. Read about algorithms: Besides the USACO training pages, there’s a lot of other material out there that can be useful for learning algorithms.If you like going through textbooks, the [LINKED_TEXT: CLRS Introduction to Algorithms] [URL: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https%3A%2F%2Fedutechlearners.com%2Fdownload%2FIntroduction_to_algorithms-3rd%2520Edition.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiYyoLkrNjyAhUZrpUCHRHFDOAQFnoECF8QAQ&sqi=2&usg=AOvVaw1MTgMaJy6tIydXbqrtS9j1] textbook is a good choice. There’s probably a lot of details in this textbook that might not necessarily be useful for competitive programming, however, it has a depth knowledge, requires maths knowledge and quite not suitable for beginners.For others, who think textbooks are too dry and/or long, you can buy an online course for learning algorithms which encloses all your needs, have good curriculum, in-depth concepts explained, good mentorship with doubt-solving facility, etc. Now, I would like to mention one such course that contains all what you need to get started with Competitive Programming.

Compete: There’s no substitution to real competition and the time crunch and pressure that comes with it.Participate in various coding contests to test your knowledge and find your weak points. It's the most important part in learning Competitive Programming.Topcoder, HackerRank, and CodeChef all have periodic online contests as well. 4. Have Fun: At last, the most important thing. Programming competitions are meant to be fun. If you’re not having fun, take a break and try coming back after sometime away from your computer. It’s hard to improve on something if you’re not enjoying it. Competitive Programming is just like a daily exercise for our brain that everyone should try.

I was wondering why I got asked, but skimming the other answers I can see this never actually got a useful response originally. There are two parts to this. The first is that the building’s structural system was really high-tech at the time, and involved using every floor of the structure to support every other floor. There was a lot of extra load capacity, but very little redundancy, and the major structure that kept the buildings from blowing over in the wind was on the very top floors: What this means is there wasn’t really a “safe” amount of the upper floors that could collapse - any amount of structure lost off the top would critically compromise the entire building. This is very different from how things had been designed previously, and in the wake of both this collapse and the Oklahoma City bombings we learned it was a pretty bad idea. Most buildings don’t catastrophically collapse when they fail, which is a much better design goal. Here’s an example of the Windsor tower in Madrid, which caught on fire and only partially collapsed: The second part to this is that the WTC towers had a very unusual and extreme structural failure. What happened was that the outer columns lost their “lateral” support, which allowed them to buckle like a long, thin ruler (or the sides of a tin can): Here’s what that looked like in action: Buckling is what’s known as a “geometric instability” - it’s a critical load value where the columns start deflecting to the side, and once it starts the deflection is instantaneous and infinite. When the columns lost their lateral support, that critical value decreased by ~90%. In practice the failure is not actually instantaneous or infinite, but it does happen very quickly and without warning, and tends to be a complete failure because as the column gets less straight it loses even more strength. Just think about how quickly an aluminum can crumples if you try to stand on it. Engineers avoid this sort of failure mode like the plague, specifically because it leads to collapses like this, that are so rapid and energetic that they happen unexpectedly and cause total loss of the structure. We strongly prefer for buildings to give some sort of warning before they start to fail, so that they can be evacuated as much as possible. Most 9/11 truther arguments are built on incredulity that this collapse doesn’t seem like how buildings fail “normally.” What they don’t realize is that’s an intentional design goal, and this case was a really bad mistake. In fact, a lot of the 9/11 truther community is built on being openly hostile to experts in the field, because most of the perceived inconsistencies can be explained pretty trivially as design mistakes."},{"prompt":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Success By 'Secret Superstar' Could Give Aamir Khan The Title Of The World's Biggest Movie Star] [URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robcain/2017/10/03/if-secret-superstar-hits-big-aamir-khan-will-own-the-title-worlds-biggest-movie-star/#3e4df1aa8d3a]"},{"prompt":"What kind of facilities or amenities can you expect in a threestar hotel?","completion":"The main difference between amenities and facilities is that the amenities refer to things that are designed to provide comfort and enjoyment to the guests while facilities basically refer to places or even equipment built to facilitate guests in their specific needs.

The rational mindset that almost all methods are allowed in order to gain a better trade position as long as the cost of doing so ends up on the plus side of the equation. The biggest example of this being that the Netherlands was one of the last countries that officially made slavery illegal (as it was so good for business and the wealth of our nation). And until today no official apologies have been made to the the people who got ripped away from their lands to labor in horrible conditions for no personal gain whatsoever. Ethics in business seem so often secondary. If it wasn't for more dominant powers in the global trade game right now, we would consider and act upon doing trade (export mostly these days) to ANY country in the world regardless of its situation. We would rationalize it with we do good for them as we help the people of, e.g. North-Korea to have more food and better agricultural methods (two things the Dutch excel in globally). We would build dams and create islands wreaking havoc to the livelihood of the locals due to changing fishing or flooding conditions, because we gain of it and the idea was not ours, we only execute it. These ideas of participating in trade or economic adventures for self gain are embedded very deeply in our culture, so deeply that most Dutch with all their directness and self esteem won't even be able to tell that they approach things so rational and pragmatic that moral and ethical embarrassment is often a second away (especially in hindsight)."},{"prompt":"Can you use a mouse with a smart TV?","completion":"Unless you have a very long USB extension cable or a wireless mouse, this would seem a bit inconvenient as you would have to be really close to the set to use a conventional mouse.

Today both have middle classes of about the same size--but in addition India has a billion starving peasants. That's one helluva difference. What we should be doing, each in our own nations, is to look around the world, treating every other nation as an experiment in governance, and see who's doing particular things our country might benefit from adopting. For example, I'd love for America to adopt India's universal biometric database project. It would be very good for us. India has a vastly higher level of corruption than all the \\"first world\\" nations--not just America. The Indian people obviously want less corruption (except for the ones profiting from it). So I think Moti is right in emphasizing that--it's like seeing someone whose body is covered with ticks sucking his blood, making him too weak to work efficiently. India should start not by looking at America but at countries that are more similar to India in terms of demographics and natural resources, and see how if any of them were able to reduce their corruption, and try to adopt those policies. However, that's limited by India's federalism, that gives each state so much power that federal anticorruption efforts won't do much if the states continue doing \\"business as usual.\\" Looking at this ranking of countries by corruption: [LINKED_TEXT: World Audit Corruption] [URL: http://www.worldaudit.org/corruption.htm] I might start with looking at what Turkey and Brazil are doing about corruption.

If it was, then did Persians raise the three empires of Achamedians, Safavid, and Sasanian?","completion":"By the strict definition you are correct.

Yes the geographical area known as Iran/Persia did give birth to these empires"},{"prompt":"What happens when you get pulled over doing 100 mph?","completion":"Depends on the cop and his mood. Depends on you and your behavior. Depends on if it’s near quota time. Depends on how close it is to shift change. In 1989 I was going well over 100 on a strip of road that had no shoulder, no feeder streets, no access streets, no lights for almost two miles. It DID, however, have a turnaround, which was where the Texas DPS was sitting. I hauled ass past him, saw his lights come on, and said, “Crap.” As soon as I got to a shoulder, (at the first intersection) I pulled over, got my license, my insurance card, and was sitting on the trunk of my car when he pulled up, grinning and waving at him. He sat in his car laughing for five minutes. He couldn’t believe I’d stopped for him, had gotten out, was waiting for him and was so cheerful about it. He lectured me for about ten minutes on everything about speeding, getting out of the car on the shoulder, to my license plate frame…(it was a chasing lights one, and whether or not they were legal was debatable)…. And gave me the ticket. It SHOULD have been 110 in a 35. It was for 45 in a 35. Never ever underestimate being honest, friendly, prepared and funny… not to mention knowing and owning your idiotic behavior. Cops are people too."},{"prompt":"What skills will help anyone make a significantly higher salary as an employee?","completion":"In my opinion, there are several skills that come handy in acquiring a significantly higher salary but here are the 3 that I think are the most importants: 1. be an expert in a field that is preferably in high-demand and increase your value for the enterprise. Document facts that demonstrate it and remember that management understand money when it is time to discuss with them. 2. be good at marketing your achievements. If noone knows that you are great, not much will happen. This will also make your services in demand which will push higher the salary that companies are will to pay to get you. It is always a good idea to always have several options in case negotiation fails. 3. Be good at negotiations Understand the following. You and the management have different goals in mind that are in direct opposition from each other. You want to get the best possible work conditions and the manager has the responsability to maximize profits for the shareholders by minimizing the expenses. A good manager will make sure that his staff is happy and that good employees remain in his staff for as long as possible but he will do so by paying as little as possible. You can bet your ass that he will pay salary that are just enough to keep people in his staff and not a single penny more than what is needed. His own remuneration depends on how good he is on that. If you want a better salary, you will at least need to ask for it but much more can be done during negotiation to get the best out of it as an employee. I'm currently writing that will have the title: 6 Elements for a successful salary raise negotiation"},{"prompt":"Where does Grand Admiral Thrawn rank among nonforce sensitive Star Wars villains?","completion":"In terms of military prowess, and in being a commander that you would actually WANT to serve under, regardless of the characters subjective “good” or “bad” guy status, Thrawn is one of if not the best leaders in Star Wars. He’s a tactical and strategic genius (and in the Legends series also demonstrates an otherwise-unprecedented-in-Star-Wars grasp of logistics.) That’s true, and he’s pretty much better than the other Imperials, who operate on blunt force and unlimited resources, and he’s better than the Rebels, whose major engagement victories come entirely from sheer stupid luck (and in Rebels, near-literal deus ex machinas.) But besides that, unlike pretty much all the other Imperials including those who aren’t cackling evil space wizards, he’s the only one who prioritizes mission over self-aggrandizement and who includes in his objectives not just winning, but making sure he does it at as little a cost as possible, particularly to his own resources. Someone like Tarkin will kill off thousands of Imperial personnel to settle a petty organizational dispute, never mind blowing up whole planets as object lessons he doesn’t have to make. Even among the good guys, they won’t necessarily enjoy sending you on suicide missions if you join the Rebellion, but they’ll do it because when you’re a guerrilla insurgency, you sometimes don’t have a choice about how you do things. Basically Thrawn was created and mostly written by someone who does well with military SF, and who created a character who operates like someone working with a realistic military with not-unlimited resources that values keeping casualties low."},{"prompt":"When will USA and its European allies realize Putin isn’t bluffing when he says we are getting closer to nuclear war?","completion":"If the alternative is a world under the sway of the whims of a mad dictator does it matter? The tyrant of the kremlin must be stopped. If he will reach for nuclear fire before he is destroyed then so be it. We have no use for a world of horror and oppression. We have no desire to live within his dream. Better ten or a hundred years of winter than a thousand years of Reich. Embrace the fire."},{"prompt":"Why is the book I Alone Can Fix It by Pulitzer Prizewinning Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker so controversial?","completion":"Why would you say it’s controversial? Where exactly is this controversy. Why did I have to search the title to even know it was a book? I don’t have cable and so don’t watch cable news, but I do view YouTube videos and I noticed in the last week or so a flurry of videos, usually by Fox News personalities, commenting on Chris Cuomo’s suspension for CNN. I found this remarkably incestuous and the implications disturbing. Apparently, cable news is like a small town where everyone knows everyone else’s business and everyone is talking about the kerfuffle between the Browns and the Kavanaughs. It is all emblematic of the term provincial, a label applied to unsophisticated folk who imbue meaningless issues with great emotion. The book fits right in, except that the small town folk whose lives revolve around the media soap opera aren’t particularly literary folks. Nevertheless, I realized that I had already seen an excerpt of the book that discussed the disappointment of CIA officers that Trump didn’t pay more attention to their highly detailed expositions of covert operations. When I put it together, I finally understood. This is a book for morons. Anyone who has ever done a successful executive presentation knows that you keep it brief, hit the major themes and allow the principle(s) to ask questions that probe the details for which one is hopefully well prepared to answer, very much like presenting a case to the Supreme Court. An executive, if they are any good at all, leaves the details to others and focuses on managing priorities and resources. Do you really think Tim Cook is going to sit through a forty slide PowerPoint to hear how you solved the race condition problem? The authors are journalists, whose work product can be charitably be called ideas. The problem is that all the really good ideas come from experience actually accomplishing concrete things. which of course no journalist has, or ever will have. So here is the problem most of the country understands or feels in their gut. If Trump is such a moron, how could he possibly have been as effective as he was? If Joe Biden is such a genius, and has the fawning coverage of a partisan media, why is the administration so incompetent? Most people in the country don’t care about the Brown’s and the Kavanaugh’s fight over the height of the hedge between their properties. They care that the country is on the right track, that we are making progress, that our freedoms are being protected by men and women of good will. Absolutely no one except the small town media folk care about what to partisan journalist have to say about Trump’s final year in office."},{"prompt":"forgot my Apple ID password how can I reset it?","completion":"I forgot my Apple ID to activate my iPhone; this is one of the most common problems with iOS users.

Why?","completion":"Yes, in different clinical settings, for instance, in an inpatient, locked actute psychiatric unit in a hospital, a Partial Hospital Psyc. Program, emergency services in field work, etc. And I should tell you about the patients I’ve felt scared by sometime. (hu-hu !! I made a funny, hu-hu !) If you’ve worked long enough in mental health, and at all aware of your surroundings, meaning the people you work with, it’s not hard to see the paradox that there are sometimes more disturbed “helpers and healers” than many of the patients, who can be threatening and scary, but my point is there are people working with disturbed people who sometimes do the work to distance themselves from their own irrationality and deep problems, because they have ready made containers for their projections, the “sick” patients. There are those who are wounded healers, and they work from within the client’s subjective reality, and don’t run from it, because they understand from their own inescapable suffering, just being bozos on the bus with everyone else, with a smattering of special sauce which might distinguish them from the patients, but their always willing to share…. their sauce.

This blobfish looks like a blob only on the surface because it’s depressurized. In its natural habitat, it looks nothing like this at all. There are many species that will not thrive in captivity. Some animals, like many species of whales or giant squids, are enormous and on top of that they are aquatic and we are not. We would need to provide them with a marine habitat multiple times their size that would require megastructure scale construction and maintenance. Because of that, there are still many unknowns about the behaviour and biology of such huge animals.There is a huge diversity of life in deep oceans that is adapted to very high pressures. Recreating this sort of habitat for them is an enormous challenge.All aspects of the physiology and behaviour of some flying animals, like swallows, are so streamlined for flying that they would never thrive in captivity.Many animals have some very specific and unusual requirements that are very difficult or challenging to recreate. It could be a diet or something very quirky.There aren’t that many extremophile animals, like some that live in hydrothermal vents but there are many extremophile microorganisms that scientists would like to research in the lab. They cannot do it, however, because it’s too difficult to recreate their habitat that might be unlike anything that we are used to. It can be high PH, temperature, pressure, salinity and others. Often many of these all at once.What is thrive? There are many animals that humans keep in captivity and provide them with a habitat similar to what they are used to in nature but it doesn’t mean that they thrive. Famously, it’s often celebrated, when babies of many captive animals are born. Even the ones that seemingly cope with captivity might have their lifespan reduced. Although, there are also some examples of animals that live longer in zoos than in nature, where they can succumb early in life to predators. Many animals in captivity exhibit abnormal behaviours like repeating some ticks, they can self-harm, self-bite, hair or feather pluck, excessively self-groom. Some primates can even poke their eyes out with their own fists. All of this means that animals that thrive in captivity are actually rather rare in comparison to animals that don’t, at least in some aspects. Sometimes it would aid conservation efforts if some endangered species were easier to keep in zoos. The question was: Does any species exist which can’t thrive in captivity?"},{"prompt":"What industries need lead generation and marketing?","completion":"Lead generation and marketing are crucial for a wide range of industries. Virtually any industry that relies on acquiring new customers or clients can benefit from lead generation and effective marketing strategies.

Sorry, I know that\`s the most obnoxious, cynical millenial thing to say but it\`s true in this case. When a band forms, they have a vision, or at least a set sound that they\`re going for. Of course they want to become famous, because who wouldn\`t want to make obscene amounts of money playing in a band? The thing that they don\`t realize or that they think won\`t happen to them for some reason is once you do become famous and successful, commercial pressure turns you and your music into something you never wanted. This happened to basically every kind of rock music, but with punk it was worse because it originated as a rebuke of that very thing. Punk was never supposed to become mainstream, yet once it did, it became altered, commercialized, and watered down until it was nothing more than radio-friendly power pop. You just can\`t sell strip-down, 2-minute fast songs for very long, fans will get bored, which is why punk never should have been anything more than a place for underground venting sessions for jaded youths. Once your punk band becomes famous, they inevitably become something true punk fans hate, and unless they can evolve into something different but still catchy (e.g New Wave), they\`ll eventually fade into irrelevance. Another reason is the western world is, by and large, doing pretty well right now. LGBTQ people are more accepted than perhaps ever, race relations are better, economic circumstances are still tenuous, maybe, but not enough to make people start a whole musical movement over it. That\`s the unfortunate downside to winning cultural battles: once you win, you start to wonder what your purpose is. The world is no fun if there\`s nothing to fight against!"},{"prompt":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?","completion":"Creatively seen discipline? I would say that I have seen this often. Most forms of it is when you teach as your discipline. The child does not then feel as bad but.they learn."},{"prompt":"Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?","completion":"All of india was Kannada speaking and all of india had ancestors who spoke kannada. Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Gujarati, Marathi, Bihari are all very recent languages and they evolved out of Kannada. we are not least known in south. Tamils, telugus, malyalis all are Kannadiga that has a language shift. But they are Kannadigas"},{"prompt":"You are having a big argument with your spouse. Your spouse grabs the family shotgun, points it at you and threatens to shoot you. What would you do?","completion":"“Do it!” I’m a man, I have pretty much no legal recourse if I disarm her with force, as she can make up whatever story she wants. I also know the ‘family shotgun,’ isn’t loaded, so there’s that and my ex-wife doesn’t know shit about shotguns."},{"prompt":"What facts about Mumbai would people not believe unless they come to Mumbai?","completion":"The following comes from my limited experience as a tourist in the City of Dreams:- The Buildings: For someone who has lived her entire life in Assam (Zone V) or New Delhi (Zone IV), the “skyscrapers” in Mumbai (Zone II) come as a BIG surprise. Here, even the oldest and most rickety-looking buildings are at least 20 storeys tall. Poor me, I am still nursing a neck pain from too much of trying to crane my neck to look upwards towards the terraces.Refer: [LINKED_TEXT: Earthquake zones of India] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_zones_of_India].The Weather: It’s humid. Here in Mumbai, even an otherwise moderate 30 degree celsius does not spell respite. The 93% relative humidity in the air takes care of that; it is enough to make the day hot and stuffy.The Traffic: The duration and extent of the traffic jams in Mumbai made the jams I had previously seen in any other place of India seem like cruel jokes.The Prices: A single fist-sized vada pav at Juhu Beach costing INR 30 feels like an exorbitant meal, especially if you are used to a full plate of steaming hot chicken momos for the same price elsewhere (Guwahati, to be precise).The Roads: They are so wide that in Powai, in front of the IITB campus, crossing one felt like I was crossing the entire width of a football field (an exaggeration, of course, because I don’t have the experience of crossing one). And yet, these wide roads are almost always jam-packed with vehicles.The People: I hadn’t met more polite attendants, cab drivers or shopkeepers before; everyone addresses everyone else as Sir/Madam and rude language is rarely ever heard. In fact, the people at [LINKED_TEXT: Crossword Bookstores] [URL: http://mumbai.mallsmarket.com/malls/r-city-mall-ghatkopar-west/stores/crossword-bookstores] at [LINKED_TEXT: RCity Mall] [URL: http://www.rcity.co.in/] let a friend of mine and me lounge on one of their comfortable couches and leaf through the entire [LINKED_TEXT: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: The Illustrated Edition] [URL: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone-j-k-rowling/1121061860], (which must have taken up at least an hour of their time and hospitality) without complaint.Also, Mumbaikars do not ogle at women; they do not stare. They are so polite and unobtrusive, it would make any newcomer feel welcome in the city.Transport: I didn’t have the fortune (or lack of it) to travel by the famed Mumbai local trains, but the absence of a city-wide Metro Rail network leaves one to resort to auto rickshaws or cabs (Kaali Peelis, as the locals fondly call them), that renders transportation for people without their own vehicles rather expensive.Night Life: True to its word, Mumbai is a city that never sleeps. It is a place that is warm, friendly, and embraces even outsiders as it would its own people. :)"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],P={key:0},H={key:1};function j(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=y("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",N,[(o(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(o(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),a("div",M,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
