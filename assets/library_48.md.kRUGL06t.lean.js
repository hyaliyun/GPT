Nice sweatshirt!” I was passing through the hallways of school last year, being messenger boy for the teachers, when this girl walked up to me. I had no clue who she was, but I thought she was a year younger than me. That’s why I thought it was weird that she said my name. But the “nice sweatshirt” bit was what really got me. I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt’s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of “try not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling”. I wasn’t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it. I was wearing Evan’s. It’s also kind of sad because that was one of the only compliments I’ve gotten from a stranger all year.

These are the reasons: 1. Ethnicity: The second premise does not specify the ethnicity of the man, making it impossible to conclude that he is Asian without additional context or information. 2. Color of the Jacket: The color of the man's jacket is also not specified in the second premise. The man could be wearing a jacket of any color - it could be blue, but we don't know for sure. 3. Color of the Candles: While not mentioned in the first premise, the second premise specifies that the candles are red. The first premise does not specify the color of the candles the man is putting into the cake. Hence, based on this detail, it might seem plausible that the two statements could be talking about the same situation, but again, we lack complete certainty without further detail. 4. Actions: The action described in both the premises are identical - a man putting candles into a cake. This is the only detail that aligns perfectly with the first premise. In conclusion, without additional specifics relating to the man’s ethnicity and the color of his jacket, we cannot confirm that both premises are describing the same situation or event. Moreover, the color of the candles introduces an extra detail in the second premise that was absent from the first, adding another layer of ambiguity. We must be cautious in our interpretations and recognise that details such as these matter and can change the entire meaning of a scene or statement. Therefore, although some elements might seem similar, without full clarity on all the aspects described, we cannot state with certainty that the first premise is true based on the second premise alone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that Lee grieves for? Four days after the events of Rush Hour, LAPD Detective James Carter is on vacation in Hong Kong visiting his friend, Hong Kong Police Force Chief Inspector Lee, whom he met and befriended after working together to save the Chinese Consul Han's daughter, Soo Yung, in Los Angeles. Their leisure is temporarily put on hold as soon as a bomb explodes at the United States Consulate General, murdering two undercover U.S. Customs agents inside of it. Inspector Lee is assigned to the case, which becomes personal when it is discovered that it somehow involves Ricky Tan, his late police officer father's former partner. Ricky, who was suspected of having a role in elder Lee's death (although never proven), is now a leader of the Triads. This, however, causes Lee and Carter to get into a brawl between them and Ricky's bodyguards, with Carter becoming shocked with Lee as they were busy with their vacation. The U.S. Secret Service, led by Agent Sterling, and the Hong Kong Police Force soon get into a fight over the jurisdiction of the case. Suddenly, Lee's office that Carter was in is bombed, causing Lee to believe he's dead and grieve for him. Carter is revealed to be alive, leaving the room before it exploded. He and a relieved Lee cross paths at Ricky's yacht where he is holding a dinner party. Ricky scolds his underling, Hu Li, who then leaves as Lee and Carter confront her boss. Just as Ricky asks for protection, Hu Li shoots him and makes her escape in the chaos. An angry Sterling holds Lee responsible for Ricky's death, and orders him off the case. Carter is ordered back to Los Angeles for involving himself and Lee volunteers to take him to the airport. However, at the airport, Carter gets Lee to return to LA with him.

Trim an airplane.","completion":"The word \\"trim\\" has different meanings in the two given sentences, as it can be used in various contexts. In the first sentence, \\"Trim lumber,\\" trim operates as an adjective. In this context, trim refers to the state of the lumber as being cut, shaped, and prepared for use in construction or any other application where wood is needed. The lumber has been processed to remove any excess material, such as bark or branches, and has been smoothed out. To put it simply, the lumber has been made neat and tidy so that it can be easily used for any carpentry, woodworking, or building projects. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Trim an airplane,\\" uses trim as a verb that has a distinct meaning. In this context, \\"trim\\" refers to adjust or set the airplane's control surfaces, typically the elevator, aileron, and rudder, to maintain the desired aircraft balance, pitch, roll, or yaw. This is done to minimize the force applied by the pilot on the controls and maintain the aircraft in a steady and stable flight condition without constant input from the pilot. The word \\"trim\\" in this scenario involves making adjustments to the control surfaces so that the airplane can achieve a specific attitude or maintain a certain flight path efficiently without requiring continuous manual intervention from the pilot. In summary, \\"trim\\" has different meanings within the two given sentences. In the first example, it describes the state of lumber after being processed and prepared for use, while in the second example, it indicates the process of fine-tuning an airplane's control surfaces to achieve a stable and efficient flight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fatty acids are broken down to acetyl-CoA by means of beta oxidation inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose. Is the following statement correct based on the text do fatty acid synthesis and degradation occur in the same location of the cell","completion":"No, the statement is not correct.

Summarize: If the front brakes have been squealing loudly, you may need pads only. If the car or brake pedal has been shaking when braking, you'll need to have the rotors resurfaced (called \\"turning\\"), or replace them. If the car pulls to one side while braking, but stays straight otherwise, you may need calipers. This is a sign of uneven wear of your brake pads caused by uneven pressure in your brake lines. If the brakes have a grinding noise, this means rotors are done, spent, wasted, or whatever you want to call it, just replace them. There are two bolts that hold the caliper to the pad bracket, and two bolts that hold the pad bracket to the steering knuckle. You may need both SAE and Metric sizes of wrenches and sockets, as well as bleeder screw wrenches. Also, you may need a set of hex (ALLEN) or star (TORX) key wrenches or a hex or star bit socket set. Consider using line wrenches to remove calipers. Theses wrenches have a better bite and reduce the chances of rounding off hex nuts fitting on the hose end. You can always return what you don't use (keep your receipt and boxes and parts clean/undamaged). If you get caught without something while the car is apart, you may not have transportation to go buy anything.","completion":"In summary, various brake-related issues may require different solutions. If you hear loud squealing noises from the front brakes, it's likely that you need to replace the brake pads. When the car or brake pedal shakes during braking, it's a sign that the rotors need to be resurfaced (\\"turned\\") or replaced. If the car pulls to one side only while braking but remains straight otherwise, it may indicate that you need new calipers due to uneven brake pad wear resulting from uneven pressure in the brake lines. A grinding noise from the brakes signifies that the rotors have reached the end of their lifespan and need to be replaced. To perform these repairs, you'll need various tools, including SAE and metric wrenches and sockets, bleeder screw wrenches, and potentially hex (ALLEN) or star (TORX) key wrenches or a corresponding bit socket set. It's recommended to use line wrenches for removing calipers, as they offer better grip and reduce the risk of rounding off hex nuts. When purchasing tools and parts, always keep your receipts and the items in clean, undamaged condition. This allows you to return any unused items. Moreover, it's crucial to plan and have all the necessary tools and parts ready beforehand, as you may not have access to transportation if your car is disassembled during the repair process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The other species are \\"E. constans\\", \\"E. eocenica\\", \\"E. montana\\", and \\"E. rolandii\\". Can we draw the following conclusion? Eucommiaceae thrives in various environments.","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is not sufficient to conclude that Eucommiaceae thrives in various environments solely based on the fossil records of five extinct species from North America, including Eucommia jeffersonensis. While these fossils demonstrate that members of the Eucommiaceae family did exist in different regions of North America during the Eocene epoch, it does not offer enough information about the specific environments these plants thrived in or how adaptable they are. To draw such a conclusion, it would be essential to explore more extensive data on the fossil distribution, ecological preferences, and adaptations of different Eucommiaceae species. This data would include a detailed understanding of the geographic and stratigraphic distribution of the fossils, as well as the types of environments in which these plants existed. Additionally, the analysis should also address any known or hypothesized physiological or morphological adaptations that could be attributed to thriving in different environments. Furthermore, it would be relevant to compare the ecological preferences and adaptability of the extinct species with that of the extant species within the family Eucommiaceae. The modern genus Eucommia consists of a single species, Eucommia ulmoides, commonly known as the hardy rubber tree. This tree is native to China and is known to possess significant adaptability in various environmental conditions. Examining the similarities and differences between the extinct and living species may yield more insights into the environmental preferences of the Eucommiaceae family as a whole. In conclusion, while the fossil records of Eucommia jeffersonensis and other extinct North American species serve as important evidence of the past existence of the Eucommiaceae family, it does not provide enough information to conclusively state that the family thrives in various environments. A more comprehensive analysis of the fossil distribution, ecological preferences, and any potential environmental adaptations would be necessary to make such a claim."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"What happened to the Federal Building?\\" Context: \\"On April 19, 1995, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was destroyed by a fertilizer bomb manufactured and detonated by Timothy McVeigh. The blast and catastrophic collapse killed 168 people and injured over 680. The blast shockwave destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a 340-meter radius, destroyed or burned 86 cars, and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, causing at least an estimated 652 million worth of damage. The main suspect- Timothy McVeigh, was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. It was the deadliest single domestic terrorist attack in US history, prior to 9/11.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, located in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was a target of domestic terrorism on April 19, 1995. The tragic event unfolded when a fertilizer bomb was manufactured and detonated by Timothy McVeigh, an anti-government extremist with a deep resentment for the federal government. The bomb, which was created using a deadly combination of ammonium nitrate (a common agricultural fertilizer) and fuel oil, was hidden inside a rented Ryder truck. McVeigh parked the truck outside the north entrance of the Murrah building and ignited the explosives, leading to a massive explosion. The immense force of the blast not only obliterated the side of the building it was parked next to but also caused a catastrophic collapse of the structure. This domestic terrorist attack resulted in the tragic loss of 168 lives, including 19 children who were in the building's daycare center, and left more than 680 others seriously injured. The impact of the explosion was felt far beyond the immediate vicinity, as shockwaves from the blast damaged or destroyed 324 buildings within a 340-meter radius. In addition, 86 vehicles were either demolished or burned, and 258 nearby buildings had their windows shattered by the force of the explosion. The horrendous aftermath of the attack saw property damage estimates reach at least 652 million, making it clear that the consequences of this single event were vast and far-reaching. Moreover, the bombing struck a deep emotional chord with the American public, leaving many devastated and mourning the loss of innocent lives. Following an intense manhunt and thorough investigation, Timothy McVeigh was arrested and eventually charged with various crimes, including use of a weapon of mass destruction, malicious destruction of property, and first-degree murder. Alongside McVeigh, his accomplice, Terry Nichols, was also arrested and charged for his involvement in the attack. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison, while McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. The Oklahoma City bombing remains the deadliest single domestic terrorist attack in United States history, predating the events of September 11, 2001. The tragedy served as a stark reminder of the threat posed by domestic terrorism, which led to increased security measures at federal buildings across the nation. Furthermore, it contributed to substantial changes in law enforcement and counterterrorism strategies in the fight against domestic and international terrorism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Mike Krzyzewski, Bob Knight share unique relationship, history Bob Knight and Mike Krzyzewski, the two winningest D1 men's college coaches, shared an embrace on Tuesday night. NEW YORK -- Mike Krzyzewski became the winningest coach in the history of men's major college basketball at 9:36 p.m. on Tuesday, when his Duke Blue Devils defeated Michigan State, 74-69, at Madison Square Garden. The achievement, however, was not sealed until a minute later, when Krzyzewski walked to the broadcast table and shared a teary embrace with the man whom he had just surpassed, Bob Knight, who had analyzed the game for ESPN. \\"I know a lot of people don't tell you this, Coach,\\" Krzyzewski said. \\"But I love you.\\" As Krzyzewski spoke, Knight had his face buried in Krzyzewski's suit jacket. Then he pulled back, smiled and said, \\"Boy, you've done pretty good for a kid who couldn't shoot.\\" Knight laughed and slapped Krzyzewski hard on the shoulder. \\"I think that meant he loved me, too,\\" Krzyzewski said later. \\"I'm going to take it as that.\\" It has been a long, winding, tumultuous, heartfelt and sometimes heartbreaking ride that brought Mike Krzyzewski and Bob Knight to that embrace. But there they were, sharing the happy coincidence that allowed them both to be present for this moment in history. The record now shows that Krzyzewski has 903 career wins to Knight's 902, but their relationship cannot be defined by mere numbers. It only took five decades, but these two men finally speak each other's language, even if those closest to them don't. \\"Their relationship fascinates me. It kind of defies description,\\" Krzyzewski's wife, Mickie, said Tuesday night. \\"It's sort of unbelievable that they're a coach and player who together have 1,800 wins. But the relationship between Coach Knight and Mike, which healed years ago, is much more unique to me than the fact that they share this honor.\\" Grant Hill: A former player talks Coach K's impact on and off the court It's amazing enough that a man would surpass his former college coach to break the NCAA's most significant coaching record. What's even more amazing is that the university which brought them together wasn't a basketball factory like Kansas, Kentucky or UCLA. It wasn't even Ohio State, where Knight was a reserve guard on the 1960 NCAA championship team. Rather, it was the United States Military Academy at West Point, a place known more for churning out generals and presidents than Hall of Fame basketball coaches. Knight was just 25 years old when he walked into Bill and Emily Krzyzewski's living room in the spring of 1965 to recruit their son, who led Chicago's Catholic League in scoring while playing point guard for Weber High School. (Krzyzewski's dad used the surname Kross because he believed it would be easier for him to find work.) Mike's parents were enticed by the idea that their son could attend such a prestigious university, but to his parents' consternation Mike told Knight he wasn't interested. He hoped that he could play for a Midwestern college with a better hoops program such as Creighton, Detroit, maybe even a school in the Big Ten. When those offers never came, his parents' prodding -- their \\"ethnic pressure,\\" as Krzyzewski calls it -- eventually changed the boy's mind. As Army's point guard, Krzyzewski earned his minutes by accepting Knight's abuse and heeding his strict instructions never to shoot. During his three years on the varsity, Krzyzewski never averaged more than seven points per game, but he led the Black Knights to two appearances in the NIT. That included a trip to the semifinal his senior year, when Army lost to Boston College in Madison Square Garden. Later that night, Krzyzewski's father suffered a massive brain hemorrhage. He was dead before Mike could get home. Knight dropped everything, followed his point guard to Chicago and stayed at the Krzyzewskis' house for three days. Mike never forgot the kindness Knight showed his mother that week as he consoled her while the two of them sat in the family kitchen. \\"That's when I saw Coach Knight start to emerge as a father figure to Mike,\\" Mickie said. Following his five-year stint in the Army, Krzyzewski joined Knight's staff at Indiana as a graduate assistant. The following year, Krzyzewski took over as head coach at his alma mater. The Knights had won just three games the previous season, but they won 20 and 19, respectively, during Krzyzewski's second and third seasons. From there, however, they backtracked, and in Krzyzewski's fifth year they finished with an overall record of 7-19. During the spring of 1980, Knight got a call from Tom Butters, the athletic director at Duke. Butters was looking to hire a basketball coach, and he wanted to float a few candidates. According to Gene Wojciechowski's forthcoming book, The Last Great Game, which tells the story of the epic 1992 regional final between Duke and Kentucky, Knight actually thought Krzyzewski was better suited for a place like Iowa State, where he wouldn't have to face so much pressure. Still, he told Butters the truth: Krzyzewski was a great defensive coach, and coming from West Point he would understand Duke's academic mission. That prompted Butters to interview Krzyzewski, and he eventually shocked the public by tapping the unknown cadet to be his coach. Gallery: Classic photos of coach Mike Krzyzewski Over the next decade, Knight and Krzyzewski remained close as they circled each other from afar. As Krzyzewski built Duke into a winner -- surviving a combined 21-34 record his second and third seasons -- he often relied on his former coach's friendship and advice. On the eve of Duke's matchup with Louisville in the 1986 NCAA final, he asked Knight to speak to his team. When Duke lost, Knight called Krzyzewski every day for a week to make sure he was OK. The next year, their teams played each other for the first time, meeting in the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament. Indiana won en route to capturing Knight's second title. Five more years passed before fate again brought their teams together. It happened at the 1992 Final Four. By that time, their career arcs had begun to diverge. In the five years since their teams last played, Knight had not returned to the Final Four. Krzyzewski, on the other hand, made five more trips, and in '91 he broke through to win his first NCAA championship. In the days leading up to the game, the two men's baser instincts -- pride, combativeness, insecurity, envy -- surfaced in subtle ways. Krzyzewski was deferential in his public remarks, but he downplayed the obvious storyline by pointing out that while Knight had had the most influence on him, he also benefited from relationships with other coaches. Krzyzewski could also become prickly when Knight's specter was invoked. During a news conference the day before Duke's second-round game against Iowa, a reporter asked him whether he had called Knight for advice on how to beat the Big Ten school. \\"No,\\" Krzyzewski snapped. \\"Somewhere in my 17 years as a coach I've figured out how to scout an opponent.\\" Unbeknown to Krzyzewski, Knight, who already had an unseemly tendency to feel threatened by his friends' successes, took offense. After the game, which Duke won 81-78, a slew of cameras predictably surrounded the two men as they approached for the postgame handshake. Krzyzewski stopped to share some words and perhaps a hug. Knight, however, stuck out his hand and blew right on by. Krzyzewski was visibly stunned. He was even more surprised a short while later after Knight wrapped up his postgame news conference, stepped off the dais and came upon the Duke contingent waiting to speak. Knight congratulated the players on their win but said nothing to Krzyzewski. Later, a mutual friend handed Krzyzewski a note from Knight that essentially said, if a divorce is what you want, then a divorce is what you've got. As his players later conducted postgame interviews in Duke's locker room, Krzyzewski sat in a backroom with tears in his eyes and lamented to his assistants, \\"There are days when life's not fair.\\" The incident led to a deep freeze between the two proud men that lasted almost a year. In December, when Krzyzewski was asked about his mentor, he replied, \\"My relationship with Coach Knight is like my relationship with my wife. And I don't talk about my relationship with my wife.\\" (The statement was unconvincing considering Krzyzewski frequently talked about his relationship with his wife.) \\"I was mad because Mike was hurting, and I just knew the problem could be solved,\\" Mickie said. \\"This was a misunderstanding. It was people saying things that are being attributed to other people. It was very frustrating for me to see Mike in that kind of agony and miss Coach so much and not be able to do anything about it.\\" Finally, in January of '93, Knight reached out. At first, Krzyzewski refused to take the call, but eventually the two men talked for over an hour. Knight never technically apologized -- saying he's sorry is not exactly the man's strong suit -- but Krzyzewski forgave him anyway and decided it was time to move on. For the next few years they were friendly but not especially close, the scars from their Final Four rupture still raw. In the winter of 1995, Indiana and Duke played each other without incident at the Great Alaska Shootout. Krzyzewski assumed the two were still on good terms when they met again in Madison Square Garden during the championship game of the preseason NIT in 1996. Krzyzewski knew that Knight liked to come out on the court close to tipoff, so he went over to the Indiana bench and waited for him. The horn sounded to mark the end of warmups, but Knight had still not emerged. The player introductions began. Still no Knight. Finally, Knight walked out ... and ignored Krzyzewski while chatting amiably with legendary horse trainer D. Wayne Lukas. Indiana pasted Duke by 16 points. Afterward, Krzyzewski was more resigned than heartbroken. \\"I'm almost glad it happened that way,\\" he told author John Feinstein for his book, A March to Madness, a look inside the ACC. \\"It lets me put a period on the end of the sentence. The end. You know, it's really kind of sad. He keeps turning friends away. I'm not the first or the last. I tried to do the right thing. I'm over it now. Five years ago, that would have hurt me. It doesn't hurt anymore.\\" As Knight and Krzyzewski went their separate ways, their careers did the same. After his team defeated Indiana in the '92 Final Four, Krzyzewski coached in three more championship games, winning his third title in 2001. Meanwhile, from 1995 to 2000, Knight's Indiana teams won a total of two NCAA tournament games. In September of 2000, Knight was fired by Indiana president Myles Brand for violating the zero tolerance policy Brand had put in place just four months before. Knight was humiliated and devastated, but Krzyzewski never called to console him. Their friends and spouses weren't sure how to repair the breach, or even if they wanted to. \\"I stayed out of it because I knew that the pain came from a real place,\\" Mickie Krzyzewski said. \\"That place was anger. Mike had to work through that before he could sincerely pick up the phone.\\" The moment to do so finally arrived in 2001. Krzyzewski had been voted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., and he needed to select a member of the Hall to present him for induction. Krzyzewski and Mickie bandied names for several days. Finally, Krzyzewski told his wife he had chosen Knight. \\"I said, 'Coach Knight? Why?' And he said, 'He's the only one,'\\" Mickie recalled. \\"It was the perfect salve for that wound.\\" Knight accepted the invitation. As Krzyzewski's three daughters took the stage that night to introduce him, Knight, whom Mickie once thought was \\"the meanest man in the world\\" while he coached her boyfriend at Army, walked off the stage, took Mickie by the hand and led her up the stairs so she could stand beside her husband. Knight's speech that night was eloquent and stirring. He told the audience that Krzyzewski was a much better player than he had given himself credit for. He said the only important thing Krzyzewski had learned from him was what not to do. And his voice quavered as he brought Krzyzewski to the stage by calling him \\"the best coach that I've had a team play against.\\" Krzyzewski climbed the stairs, shook hands with a few dignitaries, and then fell into his coach's arms and sobbed. It looked exactly like what it was: a father and son, previously estranged, reconciling in front of thousands of people. Since that day, their relationship has continued to evolve, as relationships do. They're still equal parts coach-player and father-son, but they're also fellow coaches, colleagues, best friends. They're older now, more comfortable in their own skin, less susceptible to the pettiness that almost severed them for good. When Krzyzewski praises Knight these days, there is no hint of equivocation. He has also gotten smarter about avoiding potential triggers. After Brand left Indiana to become president of the NCAA, he reached out to Krzyzewski and invited him to Brand's house to talk. Before saying yes, Krzyzewski called Knight to make sure it was OK with him. (It was.) Now, thanks to Tuesday night's events, they can enjoy one more bond, a remarkable moment when they switched places atop the NCAA's record book. Krzyzewski thanked the \\"basketball gods\\" for arranging for Knight to be there -- at Madison Square Garden, no less -- but the truth is, the gods have been arranging that moment for over 40 years. When it finally arrived, it didn't matter how turbulent or hurtful their journey had been. The only thing that mattered was where that journey had taken them, and where it takes them still. Summary:","completion":"Mike Krzyzewski became the winningest coach in men's major college basketball history when his team, the Duke Blue Devils, defeated Michigan State. He had just surpassed Bob Knight's record, who was there to analyze the game for ESPN. Both Mike and Bob have a special relationship and a long history together. They have shared ups and downs in their careers and friendship, but after a while, they were like father and son and best friends. They were both present for this great moment and it shows how far they've come in their journey together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write the answer: Which is the only bird in the Chinese Zodiac?","completion":"The Chinese Zodiac, also known as Sheng Xiao or Shu Xiang, is a traditional Chinese system that represents a repeating cycle of twelve years, with each year being governed by a specific animal sign. These animal signs possess unique characteristics and are believed to influence the personalities, fortunes, and destinies of individuals born in their respective years. Unlike the Western Zodiac, which depends on the solar calendar and is associated with constellations, the Chinese Zodiac is based on the lunar calendar, deriving from observations of the orbit of the moon around the Earth. Out of the twelve animals in the Chinese Zodiac, the only bird is the Rooster. The Rooster is the tenth animal sign in the cycle, following the Monkey and preceding the Dog. The years associated with the Rooster include 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, and 2017, and every twelve years henceforth. People born in the Year of the Rooster are said to possess characteristics similar to the bird itself. The Rooster is associated with diligence, honesty, intelligence, efficiency, and resourcefulness. Individuals born under this sign are perceived as hardworking, self-disciplined, and goal-oriented, often taking on multiple responsibilities and excelling in their chosen careers. Additionally, people born in the Year of the Rooster are known for their punctuality, good organizational skills, and assertive communication, which makes them effective leaders in various social or professional settings. However, individuals born in the Year of the Rooster may also exhibit certain negative qualities, such as impatience, egocentricity, and an overly critical disposition. They can be sensitive to criticism and may occasionally take offense easily, leading them to be argumentative or confrontational. Learning to be more patient and empathetic towards others can help them to develop stronger relationships and achieve greater satisfaction and success in their personal and professional lives. Apart from the symbolism of the Rooster in the Chinese Zodiac, some people may consider the Rooster as a prosperous symbol in Chinese culture. The Rooster's crowing is believed to drive away evil spirits, and the bird itself is associated with good fortune, abundance, and happiness. In Chinese art and artifacts, the Rooster is often depicted as a symbol of regeneration, spiritual awakening, and protection from danger. In conclusion, the Rooster is the only bird in the Chinese Zodiac, distinguished by its unique characteristics, including diligence, punctuality, and resourcefulness. As a symbol in Chinese culture, the Rooster represents good fortune, protection, and spiritual awakening, and those born in the Year of the Rooster are believed to embody these attributes. Understanding the multifaceted qualities of the Rooster can help individuals harness the bird's positive energies and mitigate its weaknesses to thrive within their personal and professional spheres."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Write an article with the title: \\"In N.H.L., Disclosure of Concussions Is Lagging\\"","completion":"Title: \\"In N.H.L., Sharing About Boo-boos on the Head is Slow\\" Hey kids! Today, we're going to talk about the big ice hockey league called the N.H.L. Sometimes, the players get hurt while playing, especially when they get a boo-boo on their head. This is called a concussion. It is important for people to know about concussions because they can be very serious. But sometimes, the N.H.L. is slow to tell everyone when a player gets a concussion. Let's find out why! When a hockey player falls or gets hit by someone, their head might shake really fast. This can make their brain move inside their head, like when you shake a box of crayons. This is not good because it can make the brain hurt. Sometimes, it can make the player feel dizzy, sleepy, or even forget things. The N.H.L. is a big group of people who make sure that ice hockey games happen. They also try to keep the players safe. But sometimes, they don't always tell people when a player gets a boo-boo on their head. This means that the people who watch the games and the players' friends and families don't know what happened. One reason for this is that the N.H.L. wants to make the games fun and exciting. If people know that a player is hurt, they might get worried and not want to watch the game. The N.H.L. also doesn't want other teams to know that a player is hurt because that team might try to play harder against the injured player. But there are some not-so-nice things about not telling people about concussions. Some players might not get the help they need because they don't want to tell anyone they're hurt. This can make the boo-boo on their head get worse, and it can be even harder for them to get better. Remember, it's important to tell someone when you get hurt, whether it's a boo-boo on your head or anywhere else! The N.H.L. should help its players by letting everyone know when they get a concussion so they can get better faster. So now you know a little bit more about the N.H.L. and concussions. It's important for everyone to be safe when playing any sport, and to let others know if someone gets hurt. That way, we can all have fun and stay healthy!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which player had the last TD of the game?","completion":"Title: Unraveling the Mystery: Discovering the Player with the Final Touchdown Introduction: In football, a game can come down to the final moments, where every move matters, and every player's contribution is crucial. As fans, we're passionate about understanding not just the outcome of a game, but about appreciating the performances of individual players. Knowing who scored the last touchdown of a game is one such fascination. So, let's unravel the mystery and uncover the player who had the last touchdown (TD) of this particular game. Step 1: Research the game specifics To determine the player with the last touchdown, we must first establish which game to analyze. Whether it's an NFL matchup, a college football contest, or even a local game, gathering detailed information on the game helps in simplifying our quest. Step 2: Compile team and player statistics For any football match, numerous sources compile thorough statistics. Websites, newspapers, and television networks can all provide useful information on team and player performance, including touchdowns scored. By examining these sources, we can form a clearer picture of how the game progressed. Step 3: Scrutinize the play-by-play In addition to summarizing player statistics, many sources also document play-by-plays. These accounts describe each in-game event chronologically, making it easier for readers to follow the action and identify specific moments, including touchdowns. Delving into the play-by-play helps us pinpoint the game's final touchdown more accurately. Step 4: Validate the information Once we have identified the player in question, it is essential to cross-verify the information. Check multiple sources to ensure the reliability of the data and prevent errors. In some instances, a play that was initially ruled as a touchdown may have been overturned upon review, so scrutinizing different sources can save us from erroneous conclusions. Step 5: Analyze the player's performance After confirming the player's identity, it might be worth exploring their overall performance in the game. Evaluate their stats, consider the importance of their final touchdown, and possibly touch on the story that led up to their defining moment during the course of the game. Conclusion: In uncovering the player who had the last touchdown in a game, it's essential to tackle the task systematically and thoughtfully. From researching the game specifics to properly analyzing the player's performance, we can confidently and accurately answer the lingering question that fans yearn to know. And as we celebrate the triumphs and achievements of the players on the field, we strengthen our love and appreciation for the beautiful game – touchdown by touchdown."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A Japanese scientist recorded one bamboo plant that grew almost 1.5 meters in 24 hours! Bamboo grows almost everywhere in the world except Europe. There are more than 1,000 kinds of bamboo that grow around the world on both mountains and plains. Not all bamboo looks the same. Some bamboo plants are very thin. They may only grow to be a few centimeters wide _ . This plant also comes in different colors, from yellow to black to green. Many Asian countries have been using bamboo for hundreds of years. They often use bamboo for building new buildings. As a matter of fact, the cables that hold up the hanging bridge across the Min River in Sichuan are made of bamboo. The bridge has been in use for more than 1,000 years, and is still holding strong. In Africa, engineers are teaching poor farmers how to find water using bamboo.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: In 1969, American rock musician Jimi Hendrix, who was then at the height of his career, was arrested, tried, and acquitted in Canada for drug possession. On May 3, 1969, customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained Hendrix after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on 10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect. At a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Much of it inevitably focused on the impact his demise would have upon the organisation, and how far it might hinder the spread of jihadist extremism. Opinion was inevitably divided. Many analysts sought to differentiate between what you might call the ideological battlefield and the practical struggle on the ground. Conventional wisdom suggested that the planning of attacks had largely been sub-contracted to regional offshoots or franchises of the organisation, like al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in the lawless territories of Yemen, or al-Qaeda in the Islamic Mahgreb, which may well have been behind the recent bomb attack in Marrakesh. In this light, Bin Laden himself was seen a founding father, an inspirational figure, probably cut off from day-to-day events, especially since he was suspected of being holed up in the border badlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan. There was considerable surprise therefore when in the wake of the helicopter-borne raid in Pakistan, US officials suggested that, contrary to the prevailing view, Bin Laden still had a much greater role in coordinating al-Qaeda operations than anyone had imagined. The US Navy Seals seized a large quantity of computer files and other material at the house in Abbottabad which intelligence experts swooped upon with urgency. It is the initial review of this material which seems to have prompted the re-assessment of Bin Laden's role. US Attorney General Eric Holder has told the BBC that the material seized indicated that Bin Laden was operationally involved with al-Qaeda, and that he was pushing al-Qaeda to engage in more plots, in more areas of the world and on specific dates. Bruce Riedel, a terrorism expert at the Brookings Institution, says that he is not surprised at all by this turn of events. \\"Al-Qaeda said that he was in charge, he took credit for attacks (like that over Detroit); he was not in a cave or some remote area but in a major town where couriers came and went,\\" he says. \\"The conventional wisdom was just plain wrong and based on wishful thinking.\\" Referring to Ayman al-Zawahiri, whom many regard as effectively Bin Laden's number two, Mr Riedel says that \\"he is also very active and if he is not found soon, will recreate the same central command post\\". Opinions though are divided. Another former intelligence officer, Paul Pillar, now at Georgetown University, says that none of the material taken during the raid, nor the exploitation of it that has become public knowledge so far, \\"does anything to refute the prior mainstream view of Bin Laden as primarily a source of ideology and inspiration, and relatively detached in recent years from operational direction and control\\". He adds that commentary to the contrary has been \\"off the mark, motivated in part by an official desire to underscore the importance of eliminating this one terrorist\\". So how to square these apparent contradictions? Well until more of the information taken in the raid is released, and that could take some time, it's very hard to make a definitive judgement. But one answer may well lie in defining the exact sense in which Bin Laden may have still been in command. US officials have been quoted as saying that his directions tended to be big-picture in nature, focusing more on broader objectives than on granular operational details. \\"I wouldn't call it command and control,\\" one senior US intelligence official is quoted as saying in the Washington Post newspaper. Nonetheless the suggestion is that he did have contacts with elements of his organisation. And he was far from being cut off from events. One of the most intriguing images of Bin Laden in his Abbottabad villa was of the al-Qaeda leader watching the television news, and quite possibly also listening to the BBC World Service.

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. I am facing a new situation today: Kevin and his cousin Darlene both enjoy jogging for exercise. One day, Kevin goes out for a jog in his local neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is quite high, and he begins to sweat a lot and starts to feel a bit dizzy. On the same day, Darlene goes jogging in her neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is low and she feels perfectly normal as she continues to jog. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information and the specific situation involving Kevin and Darlene, it can be deduced that Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency. As mentioned in the background article, excessive sweating during jogging in the heat can lead to electrolyte loss that could potentially be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency include nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. When individuals are not treated promptly, they can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate, which may lead to a heart attack in some cases. In the presented situation, Kevin goes for a jog on a particularly hot day and starts to sweat profusely. He also begins to feel dizzy which, as mentioned earlier, can be an early symptom of electrolyte deficiency. The high amount of heat outside could cause Kevin's body to lose more electrolytes through sweating as he jogs, making him more susceptible to an electrolyte imbalance. On the other hand, Darlene goes jogging on a day when the amount of heat outside is low. She feels perfectly fine as she continues to jog. Since the temperature is lower, Darlene is less likely to sweat excessively, therefore reducing the chances of her losing a significant amount of electrolytes via sweat. In this scenario, she is at a lower risk of developing electrolyte deficiency compared to Kevin. To ensure proper hydration and electrolyte balance, it is important for individuals who jog in hot weather to pay close attention to their body's signals and replenish their fluids and electrolytes as needed. This can be done by consuming sports drinks or other sources of electrolytes to help restore electrolyte levels quickly in the body. In conclusion, given the combination of factors such as excessive sweating, high heat, and dizziness, Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency during his jog. Darlene, on the other hand, appears to be at a lower risk as she jogs in cooler temperatures and feels normal throughout her exercise session."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The concept of using a quotation may seem like the opposite of “writing in your own words.” However, learning to use a quote the correct way is an essential writing skill. First, you must understand when to use a direct quotation. Use a direct quotation in order to: Argue against another author’s specific idea Continue another author’s specific idea Prove your own point with the help of another author Add eloquence or power with a very meaningful quote A quote should never appear all by itself. Instead, you need to place the quote into the context of your essay. Write a sentence or two that leads up to the quotation, demonstrating the need for this particular voice. Be sure to provide the reader with any information they may need to understand this particular quote. The first time you bring a writer’s words into your own text, introduce the quote with a “signal phrase.” This should always include the name of the person (or persons) who wrote the words, as well as the full title of the work from which the quote is taken. Here are two examples: In his book End of Humanism, Richard Schechner states, “I prefer to work from primary sources: what I’ve done, what I’ve seen” (15). As Dixon and Foster explain in their book Experimental Cinema, “filmmakers assumed that the audience for their films was to be an intimate group of knowledgeable cineastes” (225). The proper way to format both your quote and the citation for your quote will depend on the style-guide you are following (MLA, APA, AP, or Chicago style). The specific rules of block-quoting, citation, and even the placement of the quotation marks will be determined by the style guide you use. (The citations provided above are done in MLA format). In general, your quote should not exceed 3-4 lines of text. If it does (and it is truly necessary), you will need to use block quote formatting. At the end of the quote, include any relevant data that you have not already stated, such as the name of the author, the page number, and/or the date of publication. No matter what style guide you choose, you must always cite the author you quote. This is a crucial step and must never be skipped. Anytime you use the exact phrasing of an author, you must place this phrase in quotation marks and include the name of the author. Forgetting this step is unethical. It also puts you at risk for plagiarism. If there is no specific author, then use the editor instead, or whatever your specific style-guide requires.","completion":"This article teaches how to correctly use quotes in writing, such as when to use them, how to introduce and format them, and the importance of citing the author to avoid plagiarism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is pognophobia the fear of?","completion":"Pogonophobia is the persistent, irrational fear of beards. Yes, you read it correctly - a fear of beards. The term is derived from the Greek words \\"pogon\\" for beard and \\"phobos\\" for fear. This phobia is not generally as well known as other phobias like claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces) or arachnophobia (fear of spiders), but it does exist and for people who suffer from it, the fear can be quite real and distressing, and significantly impact their daily lives. Like any other phobia, pogonophobia manifests itself through a series of specific symptoms and behaviors, which can vary from person to person. These symptoms can be physical, psychological or behavioral in nature, ranging from minor discomfort when seeing a person with a beard to severe panic attacks. Physical symptoms may include increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, nausea, sweating, shaking or trembling, dry mouth, and feelings of dread or terror. Meanwhile, the psychological symptoms might include an overwhelming sense of anxiety or dread, obsessive thoughts about beards, an awareness that the fear is irrational but feeling powerless to overcome it, and difficulty concentrating on anything else other than this fear. The person with this phobia might display behavioral symptoms such as actively avoiding people with beards, feeling stressed in social situations where bearded individuals might be present, making significant changes to their lifestyle to avoid beards as much as possible (such as refusing to visit certain places or attend certain events), or even secluding themselves by becoming more introverted. In severe cases, even images or thoughts of beards can provoke intense anxiety in individuals with pogonophobia. This can lead to avoidance behavior where the person goes to great lengths to avoid coming into contact with bearded individuals or even images of them. In some cases, this fear could greatly impact their social life or professional life. The causes of pogonophobia, like with most phobias, are complex and multifaceted. It is typically thought that phobias arise from a combination of external events (i.e. traumatic events) and internal predispositions (i.e. heredity or genetics). As with other specific phobias, pogonophobia could develop after a traumatic incident involving a person with a beard. For instance, a person might develop this fear after a frightening encounter with a bearded individual during childhood. The vivid memory of the beard from the traumatic event may induce future anxiety responses when the person sees others with beards. More research is needed in this field to better understand why individuals develop this unique phobia. Treatment for pogonophobia, like other specific phobias, can include exposure therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and sometimes medication for associated symptoms like severe anxiety or panic attacks. CBT works by changing the thought patterns which lead to the fear and anxiety, helping the person to develop a better understanding of their fears and how to deal with them. Exposure therapy, on the other hand, involves gradual and repetitive exposure to the source of fear, helping the person to become less sensitive over time. In summary, while it might seem peculiar to those who do not have it, pogonophobia is a legitimate condition that can significantly disrupt a person's life. It is important that it be taken seriously and that treatment be sought if it begins to interfere with daily activities, relationships, or one's emotional well-being."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Background: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] Paragraph: 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area, because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year.

These stories included tales of monsters and other incredible creatures. What type of creature do you know that could inspire such stories? Of course, dinosaur fossils were once mistaken for dragons bones. Two thousand years ago, people discovered fossils in China. At the time, they were thought to be dragon bones. We know now that these were not bones, but fossils. So what is the difference? According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of things can fossils tell us?\\" is \\"How old the creatures were\\"?","completion":"While the claim that fossils can tell us how old the creatures were is not explicitly stated in the provided paragraph, it is valid and relates closely to the broader topic. It's accurate to infer that analyzing fossils may provide insights into the age of the creatures when they died, although this might not be precise in all circumstances. However, based on the information given in the text, it specifies that fossils can primarily inform us about how these ancient organisms lived and what type of world they occupied. When mentioning fossils, the central aspect discussed is their capacity to shed light on Earth's history and the lifestyle of creatures that lived millions of years ago. For instance, through studying different types of preserved fossils from various epochs, scientists can decipher patterns of evolution, understand more about prehistoric climates, and even get clues about significant events, like extinctions. Furthermore, the text also describes that the discovery and interpretation of fossils, such as those mistaken for \\"dragon bones\\" in ancient China, have stimulated human imagination, driving them to create myths, stories, and explanations for the unexplainable. There is a subtle, yet vital difference between bones and fossils. Bones are made of a living tissue that decomposes over time. Usually, it does not last long enough to become fossilized. In contrast, fossils represent the remains or traces of organisms that were living in the past. The process of fossilization occurs when the decomposable organic material of a creature is gradually replaced by minerals and is preserved in the Earth's crust. In certain cases, it is not the bones, but only the imprints or footprints of the creature that get fossilized, providing valuable clues about the creature’s behavior and ecosystem. In a nutshell, while the text does not explicitly note that fossils can tell us the age of the creatures, it does indicate that fossils are crucial tools for understanding our planet's rich and diverse history. By analyzing fossils, researchers can piece together the puzzle of Earth's past, unveiling how ancient organisms lived and revealing the type of world in which they existed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.

And more than half of the youths living with HIV don't even realize they're infected The bottom line: 1,000 American teenagers and young adults become infected each month with HIV. \\"Given everything we know about HIV and how to prevent it after more than 30 years of fighting the disease, it's just unacceptable that young people are becoming infected at such high rates,\\" CDC chief Dr. Thomas Frieden said Tuesday. The upswing is driven largely by infections among young black men, who accounted for about 45 percent of new diagnoses in this age group. Most infections occurred in men who have sex with men, the study finds. And, gay and bisexual high school kids were most likely to take part in risky behavior, such as having multiple sexual partners and injecting illegal drugs. What's does the CDC say is needed to reverse the trend? More testing for starters. Right now, only 13 percent of high school students get screened for HIV each year, despite the fact that both the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend routine testing for adolescents. Frieden says it's also important that HIV-positive adolescents get antiretroviral drug treatment, which can lower their risk of spreading the virus to others. Finally, the CDC plans to beef up education for kids about ways to protect themselves and avoid risky behavior. \\"The AIDS epidemic seems very remote to young people,\\" Dr. Kenneth Mayer, the Director of HIV Prevention at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, told USA Today. \\"There is no equivalent of a young Magic Johnson. If you are young, this seems like a disease of old people.\\" ||||| The finding adds to the evidence that doctors need to routinely screen all patients for HIV.

Many medical groups now recommend routine HIV testing for everyone ages 15 to 65 One-third of people with HIV are tested late and develop full-blown AIDS within a year of diagnosis More than 30 years after the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, young people are again taking dangerous risks with their lives, according to a new report from the Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention. About 1,000 young people ages 13 to 24 are newly infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, each month, according to new data released for the first time. About 60% of HIV-positive young people have no idea that they're infected, according to the report released Tuesday. Young people ages 13 to 24 account for more than a quarter of the 50,000 new HIV infections each year, the CDC says. About 1.2 million Americans have HIV or AIDS. \\"This is our future generation,\\" says CDC director Thomas Frieden. \\"That so many young people become infected with HIV each year is a preventable tragedy.\\" Both the financial and human costs of these new infections are staggering, Frieden says. The lifetime cost of treating someone with HIV is about 400,000. That means these new infections add 4 million in new healthcare costs each month. And while new HIV infections have leveled off among most groups, they are rising among young people, says Kevin Fenton, who leads the CDC's office on AIDS. Most of that increase is being driven by new HIV infections in young black men who have sex with men, he says. The finding adds to the evidence that doctors need to routinely screen all patients for HIV, says Kenneth Mayer, medical research director of Boston's Fenway Health, a community health organization that provides AIDS services. Last week, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force endorsed routine HIV testing for everyone ages 15 to 65. The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics also call for routine screening, beginning in the teen years. Yet only 13% of high school students have been tested for HIV, the report says. Frieden says doctors need to get the message that screening is essential. While the number of people who refuse an HIV test is very small, he says the number of doctors who fail to offer the test is great. \\"They key here is to make it routine screening, just like we have cholesterol screening,\\" Frieden says. \\"If someone refuses, that is their right, but we should say this is what we do.\\" Getting tested is the first step to treatment, which can dramatically improve patients' health and also prevent them from spreading the infection, Mayer says. People who know they're HIV-positive are less likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as sharing needles or having unprotected sex, studies show. And people whose virus is under control, reduced to undetectable levels, are virtually incapable of spreading the infection to others, a finding that has led doctors to talk of \\"treatment as prevention.\\" Only 30% of those with HIV have their virus under control, however, due to a \\"cascade\\" of obstacles to care, including lack of insurance, poverty and other issues, Frieden says. By getting more patients on treatment, Frieden says, the nation can reduce the total amount of AIDS virus in circulation, which would dramatically reduce the number of new infections, even if people didn't change their behavior. He adds that the country needs to do a better job of educating young people about AIDS and the need to change their behavior. \\"It is astonishing the level of ignorance of basic physiology that many high school and middle school students have,\\" Frieden says. \\"There is not going to be an easy, quick, simple solution.\\" Overall, 20% of all patients with HIV are unaware of their status, according to the CDC, and about one-third are diagnosed late in their infection, after having had HIV for perhaps a decade. A number of socioeconomic factors keep people from getting tested, including the stigma of AIDS, poverty and lack of access to care. Young gay and bisexual men, along with African Americans, are disproportionately affected. About 72% of new HIV infections in this age group occur in men who have sex with men, and 57% occur among African Americans, the CDC says. Mayer notes that there are really two AIDS epidemics in the USA. The first wave of HIV patients is aging and in care, and many have their disease under control. A second wave of newly infected young people — who weren't even born when AIDS burst into the national consciousness three decades ago — now often acts as if they're unaware of the tremendous risks they're taking, Mayer says. According to the new CDC report, which interviewed high school students, young men who have sex with men are more likely than others to have had four or more sex partners and to have injected drugs. Among sexually active students, young gay or bisexual men were more likely to have used alcohol or drugs before their last sexual experience and were less likely to have used a condom. Young gay and bisexual men were less likely, however, to report being taught about AIDS or HIV in school, according to the CDC. \\"The AIDS epidemic seems very remote to young people,\\" Mayer says. \\"There is no equivalent of a young Magic Johnson.

Options: a ) 88 , b ) 108 , c ) 110 , d ) 75 , e ) 93 Output:","completion":"To solve this problem, let's first understand the provided information and what we need to find. Given information: 1. Veena ranks 73rd from the top in a class of 182 students. 2. There are 35 students who have failed. We need to find Veena's rank from the bottom, considering the failed students. Let's follow these steps: Step 1: Determine the total number of students who haven't failed. Since 35 students have failed, the total students who haven't failed = 182 - 35 = 147 students. Step 2: Find Veena's rank among the students who haven't failed. Since Veena ranks 73rd from the top, she is actually the 73rd person from the top who hasn't failed. Step 3: Determine Veena's rank from the bottom. We know that there are 147 students who haven't failed. So, if we take Veena's rank from the top (73rd) and subtract it from the total students who haven't failed (147) and add 1, we should get her rank from the bottom. Rank from the bottom = (Total students who haven't failed - Veena's rank from the top) + 1 Rank from the bottom = (147 - 73) + 1 = 74 + 1 = 75 So, Veena's rank from the bottom is 75, which corresponds to option d) 75."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The symptoms of infection were seen in the lungs but not the kidneys, as the Pick from: +lungs were prone to maladies.; +kidneys were prone to maladies.;","completion":"The symptoms of infection were seen in the lungs but not the kidneys, as the lungs were prone to maladies. This can be attributed to several factors such as anatomical, physiological, and environmental influences that make lungs more susceptible to infections and various diseases. Firstly, the lungs are anatomically designed to be exposed to the external environment. They are a primary component of the respiratory system, responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air we breathe and the blood. Due to this constant exposure to environmental particles, pathogens, and pollutants, the lungs are inherently more prone to infections and maladies as compared to the kidneys. The mucus lining in the lungs catches and removes some of these particles, but it may not be able to eliminate all harmful microorganisms. Secondly, the physiology of the respiratory system contributes to the vulnerability of the lungs. The human lungs have a large surface area that facilitates gas exchange, but it may also provide an ideal environment for the growth and multiplication of microorganisms. Additionally, the bronchial tree pattern is another physiological factor that can lead to the retention of particles and pathogenic agents within the lungs, making elimination and clearance difficult. On the other hand, the kidneys are not exposed directly to the external environment. They are part of the urinary system, performing vital functions such as filtering waste products and excess water from the blood to produce urine. Surrounded by a protective layer of fat and cushioned by other abdominal organs, kidneys are located higher up in the abdominal cavity, making them less vulnerable to infections when compared to the lungs. Furthermore, infections or maladies affecting the kidneys are mostly caused by the presence of harmful microorganisms in the blood or urinary tract, which may come from other parts of the body. Although urinary tract infections can occur, they usually involve the lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra) rather than the kidneys themselves. When infections reach the kidneys, they are primarily due to the spread of existing infections from other sources in the body. Another factor that affects the lungs' vulnerability to maladies is the effect of various lifestyle and environmental factors, such as smoking, pollution, and occupational exposures. These factors significantly contribute to the lungs' vulnerability to infections and diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and lung cancer. In summary, the symptoms of infection were seen in the lungs but not the kidneys, as the lungs were prone to maladies due to their anatomical positioning, physiological characteristics, and constant exposure to various environmental agents. The kidneys, being more protected and less exposed, are less susceptible to infections and maladies as compared to the lungs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes and along the French-German border to split the Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at Antwerp to prompt a political settlement. By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled. In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Soviets and Poles attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia. On 4 February, Soviet, British and US leaders met for the Yalta Conference. They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan. In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while Western Allies entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr, encircling the German Army Group B, while the Soviets advanced to Vienna. In early April, the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while Soviet and Polish forces stormed Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany. Several changes in leadership occurred during this period. On 12 April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by Harry S. Truman. Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April.

Write an article based on this \\"The US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has announced a global partnership to tackle the scourge of toxic smoke from indoor cooking fires.\\"","completion":"Title: Tackling Toxic Smoke from Indoor Cooking Fires: A Global Partnership Initiative Introduction In a significant effort to eradicate the increasing hazard of toxic smoke from indoor cooking fires, the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has announced the launch of a groundbreaking global partnership. The initiative aims to address this harrowing issue that affects millions of lives, especially in developing countries. By utilizing resources and expertise from several countries, this partnership seeks to deploy sustainable solutions that will not only alleviate the health risks associated with indoor cooking fires, but also contribute to the global fight against air pollution. Step 1: Identifying the Problem The toxic smoke emanating from indoor cooking fires poses severe health risks to millions of people, particularly women and children who spend long hours within close proximity to these fires. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to indoor smoke leads to approximately 1.6 million deaths per year, primarily caused by respiratory illnesses, heart diseases, and lung cancer. This emphasizes the critical need for action by governments, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders to devise effective strategies and policies to combat this crisis. Step 2: Collaborating to Develop Solutions The announcement of this global partnership demonstrates the firm commitment of the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and partner countries to devise sustainable solutions to combat the scourge of toxic smoke from indoor cooking fires. By bringing together experts, policy makers, and researchers from multiple disciplines, this collaborative effort aims to identify the most effective and locally-appropriate interventions. Step 3: Implementing and Promoting Clean Cooking Technologies One pivotal aspect of the partnership's strategy is the promotion and implementation of clean cooking technologies. By replacing traditional, polluting cooking methods with cleaner alternatives, such as fuel-efficient stoves and solar cookers, families can significantly reduce their exposure to toxic smoke. Encouraging the use and development of these innovative technologies not only ensures their widespread adoption, but also helps boost local economies and increases energy security in resource-scarce areas. Step 4: Providing Education and Support Alongside technological solutions, the partnership also seeks to educate communities about the risks associated with indoor cooking fires and inform them of the benefits of clean cooking alternatives. Providing women with training and support in the use of clean cooking technologies is crucial to sustaining any long-term improvements in their health and well-being. Additionally, incorporating lessons on the importance of clean cooking and air quality into community health programs can raise awareness and further encourage the adoption of safer practices. Step 5: Evaluating and Expanding Efforts As part of the global partnership, ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the implemented interventions will be essential to ensure the effectiveness of the efforts to combat toxic smoke from indoor cooking fires. By tracking the progress made and analyzing factors that contribute to successful outcomes, the partnership can refine its strategies and expand its efforts to reach even more communities in need. Conclusion The launch of the global partnership to tackle the scourge of toxic smoke from indoor cooking fires is a monumental step towards addressing the severe health hazards and environmental consequences caused by this pressing issue. Through a collaborative approach that combines technological innovation, education, and support, the partnership hopes to transform the lives of millions of people and contribute to the global effort to combat air pollution and climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Shanghai, there is also a group of children learning music. But their story is a bit different. The musical group, \\"Shepherds' Kids\\" , was founded by the Shanghai Jiuqian Volunteer Center. There are about 40 students in this group. Their parents are migrants working in Shanghai. \\" The music courses are free,\\" said Zhang Yichao, founder of the group. \\"We just want to make the children's lives more colorful.\\" The kids learn singing, dancing and musical instruments.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The plot is told as a series of (presumably chronological) vignettes surrounding the life of the namesake Mobile Army Surgical Hospital where it is set. While the episodic film lacks the cohesion of an overarching singular plot with a traditional narrative structure, the vignettes do present a clear means for the film to explore the themes of military life. Set in 1951 in South Korea, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is assigned two replacements: Captains \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and \\"Duke\\" Forrest, who arrive in a stolen Jeep. They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they soon prove to be excellent combat surgeons. As the film progresses, further scenes introduce additional characters. Some characters are already at the camp when Hawkeye and Duke arrive, such as the bumbling commander Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, the morose dentist Walter \\"Painless\\" Waldowski, the incompetent and pompous surgeon Frank Burns, and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy. Other characters arrive after Hawkeye and Duke, and become integrated into camp life, such as surgeon Trapper John and Nurse Margaret Houlihan. After the characters are introduced, which forms the opening act, further comedic episodes explore the evolving relationships between the characters. The main characters in the camp divide into two factions; Hawkeye, Duke, and Trapper John form one faction; all three were drafted into the army and are not as dedicated to the mission or lifestyle of the military. They are prone to pranks and heavy drinking. The other faction forms around the romantic relationship between Majors Houlihan and Burns, who are both career military personnel. The two factions battle back and forth in a series of pranks and reprisals (one involving exposing a naked Houlihan to the camp when the walls of the shower tent are collapsed, another embarrassing the couple by exposing their heretofore secret romance) until Burns is goaded into punching Hawkeye and removed from the unit for...

Question: I have a new situation: The Doctor studied two teams of people. Team N had no viral infections, while Team W had many people with HIV among its members. Obviously, team N had fewer health issues. But I can use this background: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. What is an answer for this question: Which team had more people receiving interferon? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, we can determine that Team W, the team with many people infected with HIV, likely had more people receiving interferon. This is because interferon is an antiviral drug used to treat viral infections, and since Team W has more individuals with a viral infection (HIV), it is logical to assume that more people in this team would require treatment with antiviral drugs such as interferon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose you Exercise more regularly happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of exercising more regularly can have both direct and indirect effects on the liver's process of cleaning the blood. Direct effect: Exercise improves overall blood circulation which means more blood reaches the liver, providing sufficient oxygen and nutrients necessary for its functions. This ultimately makes the liver work more efficiently, resulting in a \\"softer\\" functioning process. Indirect effects: Exercise has broader systemic benefits for the body, including: 1. Weight management: Regular exercise helps in maintaining a healthy weight, reducing the risk of developing fatty liver disease and lessening the pressure on the liver. 2. Improved metabolism: Exercise boosts the metabolism, assisting the liver in processing and breaking down toxins, fats, and other waste products more effectively. 3. Strengthening the immune system: Physical activity strengthens the immune system, which supports the liver in its role as a defender against infections and harmful substances. 4. Reduced inflammation: Exercise can help reduce inflammation in the body, indirectly easing the burden on the liver and allowing it to work more efficiently.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Understanding Pigments Different kinds of pigments exist, and each absorbs only certain wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments reflect the color of the wavelengths that they cannot absorb. All photosynthetic organisms contain a pigment called chlorophyll a, which humans see as the common green color associated with plants. Chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not from green. Because green is reflected, chlorophyll appears green. Other pigment types include chlorophyll b (which absorbs blue and red-orange light) and the carotenoids. Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is its absorption spectrum. Many photosynthetic organisms have a mixture of pigments; between them, the organism can absorb energy from a wider range of visible-light wavelengths. Not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight. Some organisms grow underwater where light intensity decreases with depth, and certain wavelengths are absorbed by the water. Other organisms grow in competition for light. Plants on the rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that comes through, because the taller trees block most of the sunlight (Figure 5.11).

Analyzing Sentence 2: - Statement: Films are dubbed because the Spanish don't like reading subtitles (This sentence provides a reason as to why films are dubbed) 3.

He called the widow of Roger Maris a few days ago, a surprisingly bold move that surely resulted in one of the most awkward phone conversations this side of Bobby Kennedy-George Wallace. Mark McGwire apparently felt it was the right thing to do. And, indeed, he was correct. Pat Maris deserved to hear the words \\"I juiced\\" straight from the artificially enhanced horse's mouth; deserved to know why she and her family had unwittingly served as his official cardboard props some 12 years ago; why her late husband's single-season home run mark (arguably the most hallowed standard in all of American sports) had been tattered by a man boasting all the integrity of a Times Square pickpocket. Think back, if you will, to September 8, 1998, when McGwire hit his record-breaking 62nd homer of the season at Busch Stadium, then immediately walked toward the stands to embrace the Maris children. Later, with tears streaming down his cheeks, McGwire told the media how, earlier that day, he had held the bat Roger Maris used when he set the old mark. \\"I touched it with my heart,\\" he said. \\"When I did that, I knew tonight was going to be the night. I can say my bat will lie next to his, and I'm damn proud of it.\\" By all accounts, back then Pat Maris thought the large humanoid erasing her late husband from the record books to be an honorable fellow, one worthy of holding such a distinguished mark. And now? \\"I think she was shocked when I called,\\" McGwire said yesterday in his interview with Bob Costas on the MLB Network. \\"She was disappointed and she has every right to be.\\" In case you haven't received the official memo, protocol dictates this as the time when we're supposed to forgive, forget and move forward. Yes, Mark McGwire used steroids and human growth hormone. Yes, it was against the law. Yes, they are termed performance-enhancing drugs for a reason. But in the world of Major League Baseball, where the phrase \\"manning up\\" is traditionally applied to an athlete playing through pain or putting on a particularly clutch display, a new, steroid-era definition has been established:. Manning Up (verb): When someone is caught cheating and, following a lengthy period of silence and/or denial, has no choice but to vaguely express remorse/regret or suffer unofficial banishment and a lifetime of Holiday Inn banquet room autograph shows for 15 a pop alongside Erin Moran and the robot girl from Small Wonder. The fawning sports media will immediately compliment his courage and welcome him back with open arms. So, like Jason Giambi and Andy Pettitte and Alex Rodriguez before him, Mark McGwire finally \\"manned up.\\" Twelve years after shattering Maris' record, five years after his embarrassing, I'm-not-here-to-discuss-the-past congressional testimony, the deflated Paul Bunyan of baseball told us that he used PED, and that he was very, very wrong. Well, very wrong. Well, pretty wrong. Well, sorta wrong. Well, uh, not really wrong at all. Between the tears and sniffles and awkward pauses, McGwire apologized for, ahem, nothing. Costas asked whether he thought he would have hit 70 home runs without steroids. \\"Absolutely,\\" McGwire said. \\"I was given this gift by the man upstairs.\\" Costas asked whether the steroids made him stronger. \\"The only reason I took steroids was for my health purposes,\\" McGwire said. \\"I did not take steroids to get any gain for any strength purposes.\\" Costas asked which drugs he had used. \\"The names,\\" McGwire said, \\"I don't remember.\\" Heck, Costas tossed the ultimate underhand softball question, just to help a guy out--Did McGwire feel as if he was cheating? \\"As I look back now as far as my health and my injuries, trying to help my injuries to help me feel normal, I can see why people would say that,\\" he said. \\"As far as the God-given talent and hand-eye coordination and the genetics I was given, I don't see it.\\" And there lies the reason I have trouble forgiving and forgetting: Mark McGwire doesn't see it. By using PED, he didn't merely take Maris' record. No, McGwire made millions in endorsements that should have gone elsewhere. He was selected to All-Star Games that should have featured other players. He won Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year as other candidates were overlooked. He convinced a nation of baseball fans that they were witnessing history--real, honest-to-goodness history--when, in fact, it was all a WWE-styled illusion. Pat Maris received her phone call.

As the deadly virus spread through the city like wildfire, it became more apparent to the residents that no one was safe. Brett and Steven, two best friends, had taken numerous precautions to protect themselves and their families from the virus. They wore masks, practiced social distancing, and constantly washed their hands. However, despite all their efforts, tragedy struck when Brett came down with the illness. Brett had always been sickly and prone to a variety of ailments, largely due to his weak immune system. As a child, he would often catch colds and fevers, needing prolonged bedrest to recover. Through high school, as his peers participated in sports and other extracurricular activities, Brett would frequently be sidelined by recurrent infections. On the contrary, Steven possessed an incredibly robust immune system, one that left him rarely sick and always ready to take on new challenges. He and Brett were inseparable, their distinct personalities fitting together like two pieces of a puzzle. Steven often took it upon himself to help Brett during his frequent bouts of illness. The two families were neighbors and the the boys grew up doing everything together. As a result, when the virus threatened their small town, they had no qualms about teaming up to protect their loved ones. The families agreed to quarantine together, knowing they would need one another's support to navigate the challenges thrown by the pandemic. In the early weeks of the virus, Brett noticed that his energy levels were decreasing and his health seemed to be deteriorating. However, attributing his symptoms to the stress of the ongoing crisis, he brushed them off as insignificant. Days later, Brett spiked a high fever, and as his condition deteriorated, it became all too clear that he had contracted the virus. Steven, frantic with worry, used his knowledge of Brett's weakened immune system to help his friend battle the virus. He worked tirelessly, coordinating with doctors over video calls, administering recommended treatments, and maintaining a sterile environment to minimize further infections among the family members.

All three actresses had previously appeared together in \\"The Inbetweeners Movie\\". Four series were broadcast, between 2013 and 2016. Hypothesis: Because four series were broadcast, the three actresses received a bonus upon the show's conclusion in 2016.","completion":"Based on the provided context, we cannot draw a definitive conclusion about whether or not the three actresses - Jessica Knappett, Lydia Rose Bewley, and Lauren O'Rourke - received a bonus upon the conclusion of the show \\"Drifters\\" in 2016. The context provides information about the actresses, the show itself, and its duration, but it does not mention any specific details about their payment structure or bonuses. There are numerous factors that could determine whether the actresses received a bonus when the show concluded. For instance, their individual contracts might include clauses that mention bonuses or other financial incentives based on the success or longevity of the series. The network that aired the show might also have specific policies regarding bonuses for their acting talent. Additionally, the overall viewership and revenue generated by the show could impact whether the actresses received a bonus. In some cases, television actors might receive bonuses for meeting performance targets, critical acclaim, or successfully adhering to the terms of their contracts. Bonuses can also be awarded to teams or ensemble casts as a gesture of goodwill or to reward their contribution to a show's success. However, without additional information on the contracts of the actresses or the financial policies of the network, it is not possible to confirm or disprove whether Jessica Knappett, Lydia Rose Bewley, and Lauren O'Rourke received a bonus upon the conclusion of the \\"Drifters\\" series in 2016. To accurately assess this hypothesis, one would need access to more information, such as the actresses' contracts, details on the network's financial policies, and any possible negotiations among the involved parties.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. When customers are not buying the products produced by human industry, it can lead to a decrease in the production and manufacturing of these products. As a result, there will be a reduction in the demand for industrial processes and a decline in business operations. This will have an indirect impact on the amount of chemical compounds released into the air. With fewer products being manufactured, industries will consume less energy and resources, leading to lesser emissions of chemical compounds. As the chemical compounds present in the air decrease, the subsequent steps of the process will also be affected indirectly. The reduced chemical compounds in the air will lead to a decrease in their mixing with the elements in the clouds. This can result in a decline in the production of acidic rain. When lesser affected rain falls to the earth, the negative impact of acidic content on natural and man-made objects will reduce. It is important to note that while the decrease in product consumption has not directly impacted any particular step of the process, the overall effect on the release of chemical compounds into the air and the subsequent steps is indirectly influenced.

Just because the package says \\"skin tone\\" or \\"natural,\\" does not necessarily mean that it will match your skin tone. For example, if you have very pale skin, you don't want something that is tanned or dark; it will look fake against your complexion. Instead, you could try ivory or something labeled \\"fair.\\" For example, if you have a black dress, then choose a pair of black tights or stockings. There is an exception to this rule, however; if your outfit is darker than the shoes you are wearing, choose nude-colored tights or stockings instead. The nude color should match the color of your legs, be it fair, neutral, Nubian, etc. For example, you are wearing black shoes, then you could wear black tights or stockings. You could also wear tights or stockings that are a little bit lighter than your shoes, but within reason. You don't want to wear white, opaque tights with black shoes. If your shoes are darker than the skirt or dress you are wearing, then wear stockings that match your skin color instead. If you are wearing open-toed shoes, go sheer and nude-colored. It would be best to skip tights or stockings altogether, however. Avoid wearing black tights with brightly-colored shoes. The contrast is stark and often cartoonish. It will also make your legs look shorter and chunkier than they actually are. Remember, not everything that is labeled \\"nude,\\" \\"skin tone,\\" or \\"buff\\" will match your legs.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Richard Hirschfeld Williams (May 7, 1929 - July 7, 2011) was an American left fielder, third baseman, manager, coach and front office consultant in Major League Baseball. Known especially as a hard-driving, sharp-tongued manager from 1967 to 1969 and from 1971 to 1988, he led teams to three American League pennants, one National League pennant, and two World Series triumphs. He is one of seven managers to win pennants in both major leagues, and joined Bill McKechnie in becoming only the second manager to lead three franchises to the Series. He and Lou Piniella are the only managers in history to lead four teams to seasons of 90 or more wins. In 1977, he returned to Montreal as manager of the Expos, who had just come off 107 losses and a last-place finish in the NL East. Team president John McHale and general manager Jim Fanning had been impressed with Williams' efforts in Boston and Oakland, and thought he was what the Expos needed to finally become a winner. After cajoling the Expos into improved, but below .500, performances in his first two seasons, Williams turned the 1979-80 Expos into pennant contenders. The team won over 90 games both years--the first winning seasons in franchise history. The 1979 unit won 95 games, the most that the franchise would win in Montreal. However, they finished second each time to the eventual World Champion (the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979 and the Philadelphia Phillies in 1980). Williams was never afraid to give young players a chance to play, and his Expos teams were flush with young talent, including All-Stars such as outfielder Andre Dawson and catcher Gary Carter. With a solid core of young players and a fruitful farm system, the Expos seemed a lock to contend for a long time to come. But Williams' hard edge alienated his players--especially his pitchers--and ultimately wore out his welcome. He labeled pitcher Steve Rogers a fraud with \\"king of the mountain syndrome\\" - meaning that Rogers had been a good pitcher on a bad team for so long that he was unable to \\"step up\\" when the team became good. Williams also lost confidence in closer Jeff Reardon, whom the Montreal front office had acquired in a much publicized trade with the Mets. When the 1981 Expos performed below expectations, Williams was fired during the pennant drive on September 7. With the arrival of his easy-going successor Jim Fanning, who restored Reardon to the closer's role, the inspired Expos made the playoffs for the only time in their 36-year history in Montreal. However, they fell in heartbreaking fashion to Rick Monday and the eventual World Champion Los Angeles Dodgers in a five-game NLCS. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Sure, imagine baseball is like a big, fun game of catch and running bases in the park. Now, Richard Hirschfeld Williams was sort of like a really important dad in this game, who helped to look after and instruct the team on how to play their best. He was a strong, straight-talking kind of manager, who managed to lead his teams to win some important matches and championships. Think of it like your favorite team in a race. Williams was the person who encouraged and pushed his team to run really fast and cross the finish line, not just once or twice, but many times! He did this with three different teams, which is a great achievement. But sometimes, he was a bit tough, like when you don't want to eat your veggies, and mom insists you do so. He was hard on some players, especially the ones who throw the ball, and that made them upset. In the end, even though the team he managed didn't win the ultimate championship under his guidance, they did it just after he left, sort of like eating all your veggies and then getting a big ice-cream as a treat after he was gone!

Nominative or subjective case pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) are used as the subject of a sentence, i.e., the person(s) or thing(s) performing the action of a verb. Objective case pronouns (me, you, him, her, it, us, them) are used as objects and are involved in receiving the action of a verb or are the object of a preposition. In the sentence \\"I introduced her to he,\\" the pronoun \\"he\\" is used as the object of the preposition \\"to.\\" According to the rules of English grammar, this position requires an objective case pronoun. As a result, the correct pronoun to use in this context should be \\"him.\\" So, to rewrite the sentence correctly, it should read: \\"I introduced her to him.\\" Linguists, as experts in the field of language, would apply these rules and agreed-upon conventions of standard English in evaluating the correctness of the sentence. Therefore, they would conclude that the original sentence \\"I introduced her to he\\" is not correct when adhering to the strictest standards of grammar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Rob was in the East Coast for a month. He had the good opportunity to see various tidal conditions. First he saw the spring tide, which he noted as case A. About a week later he saw the neap tide. He noted that as case B. Rob got curious about the science behind various tidal conditions. and a hint : When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps. Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"without the power\\", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power).Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps. Please answer this question : Which case would result in more extreme tidal conditions, case A or case B?","completion":"To answer this question, let us analyze the tidal conditions of both cases (A and B) and relate them to the description provided for spring tides and neap tides. Case A - Rob observed the spring tide. Spring tides are characterized by: 1. High waters that are higher than average. 2. Low waters that are lower than average. 3. Shorter slack water time. 4. Stronger tidal currents than average. On the other hand: Case B - Rob observed the neap tide. Neap tides are characterized by less extreme tidal conditions. This means: 1. High waters that are not as high as during spring tides. 2. Low waters that are not as low as during spring tides. 3. Longer slack water time. 4. Weaker tidal currents than during spring tides. Now, let's compare both cases. Spring tides (Case A) exhibit more extreme tidal conditions, such as higher high waters and lower low waters, shortened slack water time, and stronger tidal currents. Neap tides (Case B) show less extreme tidal conditions compared to Case A. Thus, the answer to the question is: Case A (Spring Tide) would result in more extreme tidal conditions than Case B (Neap Tide)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Santa Lucia is over 500 years old.","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the context The context informs us that Santa Lucia is an ancient Roman Catholic church in central Bologna. The church is described as having a Baroque interior architecture and is currently being used as a large lecture hall by the University of Bologna. Step 2: Identify the relevant information The context mentions that Santa Lucia is an ancient Roman Catholic church. This piece of information is essential in estimating the age of the building. Step 3: Research the historical timeframes associated with the relevant information The Baroque period extended from the late 16th century to the mid-18th century, approximately between 1600 and 1750. The Roman Catholic Church has existed for over two millennia. Ancient Rome, as referenced in the context, can be considered a civilization existing from 753 BC to 476 AD.

O'Neill was born in a hotel, the Barrett House, at Broadway and 43rd Street, on what was then Longacre Square (now Times Square). A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway, which houses offices, retail, and ABC Studios. He was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O'Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan, who was also of Irish descent. After suffering from multiple health problems (including depression and alcoholism) over many years, O'Neill ultimately faced a severe Parkinsons-like tremor in his hands which made it impossible for him to write during the last 10 years of his life; he had tried using dictation but found himself unable to compose in that way. While at Tao House, O'Neill had intended to write a cycle of 11 plays chronicling an American family since the 1800s. Only two of these, A Touch of the Poet and More Stately Mansions, were ever completed. As his health worsened, O'Neill lost inspiration for the project and wrote three largely autobiographical plays, The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey into Night, and A Moon for the Misbegotten. He managed to complete Moon for the Misbegotten in 1943, just before leaving Tao House and losing his ability to write. Drafts of many other uncompleted plays were destroyed by Carlotta at Eugene's request. O'Neill died in Room 401 of the Sheraton Hotel (now Boston University's Shelton Hall) on Bay State Road in Boston, on November 27, 1953, at the age of 65. As he was dying, he whispered his last words: \\"I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room.\\" Dr. Harry Kozol, the lead prosecuting expert of the Patty Hearst trial, treated O'Neill during these last years of illness. He also was present for O'Neill's death and announced the fact to the public. O'Neill is interred in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. In 1956 Carlotta arranged for his autobiographical play Long Day's Journey into Night to be published, although his written instructions had stipulated that it not be made public until 25 years after his death. It was produced on stage to tremendous critical acclaim and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957. This last play is widely considered to be his finest. Other posthumously-published works include A Touch of the Poet (1958) and More Stately Mansions (1967).

Question: the solution of the missing neutrino problem from the sun's core was resolved by the discovery of?? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the missing neutrino problem To answer this question, I must first understand the missing neutrino problem itself. The missing neutrino problem emerged when scientists noticed that the number of neutrinos detected on Earth was only a third of the number they expected to observe from the sun's nuclear fusion reactions. Step 2: Recall the neutrino properties Neutrinos are subatomic particles with a very small mass and no electric charge. They interact very weakly with other matter, making them difficult to detect. Neutrinos are produced during various nuclear reactions, including the ones inside the sun's core. Step 3: Identify the solution The solution to the missing neutrino problem came with the discovery of neutrino oscillations. According to the theory of neutrino oscillations, neutrinos can change their flavor (electron, muon, or tau neutrinos) as they travel through space. This change in flavor was not initially considered in the detection experiments, leading to the underestimation of the total neutrino count. Step 4: Summarize the answer The solution to the missing neutrino problem from the sun's core was resolved by the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which helped explain the discrepancy between the observed and expected number of neutrinos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase refers to the issue of corruption and bribery in Greece, which has negatively impacted the nation's political, social, and economic well-being. The situation poses a serious challenge to the public trust, individual morale, and the overall standing of the country in the international arena. This phenomenon is not unique to Greece, as corruption and bribery exist in various forms and degrees worldwide. However, the phrase suggests that this particular form of corruption in Greece has become ingrained as a way of life for some individuals. Historically, bribery has been a longstanding problem in different aspects of Greek society, including the public sector, the private sector, and even the healthcare industry. As public officials and other individuals engage in corrupt practices for personal gain, the nation and its people suffer the consequences. The adverse effects of these actions include slower economic growth, increased inequality, and the erosion of public confidence in the various institutions responsible for good governance. Despite the prevalence of bribery in Greece, there is hope for change, as attitudes and perspectives potentially evolve. Efforts to reduce corruption and bribery can be observed at both the grass-root level and governmental agencies. Measures such as implementing strict anti-corruption laws, raising awareness, and encouraging a culture of integrity and transparency contribute significantly to addressing this issue. Furthermore, organizations inside and outside Greece actively promote initiatives to combat corruption and bribery. These programs aim to strengthen the rule of law, support honest businesses, and encourage good governance by building capacity among relevant stakeholders. In conclusion, the phrase highlights the issue of bribery in Greece, emphasizing its negative consequences for the country's overall development. However, there is a possibility of change with shifts in attitudes and the implementation of preventive measures against corruption. Efforts from various sectors, individuals, and organizations can help create a system that upholds transparency, accountability, and integrity, ensuring a better future for Greece."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read this article and answer this question Coming off their impressive home win over the Steelers, the Cardinals flew to the Edward Jones Dome for a Week 5 divisional duel with the winless St. Louis Rams. In the first quarter, Arizona trailed early with Rams kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 46-yard field goal. The Cards would tie the game with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 50-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Cardinals trailed again with QB Gus Frerotte completing a 16-yard TD pass to WR Drew Bennett. Arizona would tie the game with RB Edgerrin James fumbling at the 1-yard line and OG Reggie Wells recovering the fumble in the endzone for a touchdown. However, on the Cards next possession, QB Matt Leinart was sacked by MLB Will Witherspoon, causing his left collarbone to get broken, getting him out for the rest of the game. Back-up QB Kurt Warner (former Rams QB) came in for the rest of the game. Afterwards, St. Louis would respond with Wilkins kicking a 35-yard field goal. Afterwards, Arizona would end the half with Warner getting a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Rams retook the lead with Frerotte completing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt. Afterwards, the Cards would tie the game with Rackers getting a 32-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Cards increased its lead with CB Roderick Hood returning an interception 68 yards for a touchdown. St. Louis tried to pass the Cardinals for the lead as Wilkins got a 31-yard field goal. Arizona increased its lead with Warner's 7-yard TD pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald. The Rams would get close with Frerotte's 29-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael, followed up with a successful two-point conversion pass from Frerotte to Holt. The Cards would emerge victorious. Which players made field goals longer than 40-yards?","completion":"In the article, two players made field goals longer than 40-yards.

(I). no; (II). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"First, let's address each question individually: Question 1: Has anyone gotten a refund from Ramit Sethi's courses? Ramit Sethi is a recognized personal finance advisor and author, best known for his book \\"I Will Teach You To Be Rich\\" and his online courses related to personal development and business growth. Although I don't have access to specific customer experiences, there are testimonials available online from people who have participated in his courses and shared their feedback. In general, the satisfaction rate for his courses seems to be high, and many participants express appreciation for the content and the value they received from it. Like any other educational resource, the experience may vary depending on an individual's goals and commitment. Ramit Sethi's courses often come with a refund policy, which is usually mentioned on the course's sales page or terms and conditions. These policies may include money-back-guarantees within a specific timeframe (e.g., 30 or 60 days) or under specific conditions, like showing proof of having completed the coursework and still not achieving the desired outcomes. Although I cannot confirm specific instances of customers receiving refunds, it is reasonable to believe that some individuals have requested and received refunds if they were not satisfied with the course content or if they did not achieve the anticipated results within the specified time and conditions. Question 2: Has anyone received a refund from VIT? VIT refers to Vellore Institute of Technology, a renowned higher education institution in India. Being an educational institution, it is common for universities and colleges to have refund policies in place (though it depends on individual institutions and their specific policies). These policies may be applicable for various reasons, like withdrawal from the course, not being able to attend due to unforeseen circumstances, or not receiving a visa (for international students). While I cannot provide specific examples of individuals who have received refunds from VIT, it is highly likely that some students have received refunds based on the refund policies in place. To determine if a refund is available for a particular situation, a student would need to consult the appropriate department or office at VIT to discuss their specific case and the institution's policies. Regarding whether the answers to these two questions would be the same (i.e., either both being 'yes' or both being 'no'), it is impossible to give an accurate response since Ramit Sethi's courses and VIT are two separate entities with different offerings and refund policies. In summary: 1. It is likely that some individuals have received refunds from both Ramit Sethi's courses and VIT based on their respective refund policies and individual circumstances. 2. The answers to the two questions may not necessarily be the same, as they refer to different entities and depend on differing contexts. For more accurate information, it is recommended to consult the respective customer support or administrative departments of Ramit Sethi's courses and VIT regarding their refund policies and procedures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what makes a river wider?\\" is \\"salinity\\", given that clearing land can make a river wider?","completion":"The right answer to the question \\"what makes a river wider?\\" is not solely salinity, as there are several factors that can contribute to the width of a river. Although salinity may have some indirect effects on river morphology, it is not the primary factor in determining a river's width. Clearing land, as mentioned in the question, is just one of the many factors that can impact the width of a river. Let's discuss some of the key factors contributing to the width of a river: 1. Discharge: Discharge is the volume of water in a river moving through a cross-section at a given time, typically measured in cubic meters per second (m³/s). A larger discharge typically tends to result in a wider river as the water needs more space to flow and transports more sediment, which forms and modifies river channels. 2. Erosion: Erosion is the natural process of wearing away and removing rock and sediment from the riverbed and banks. Hydraulic action, abrasion, and corrosion are types of erosion that occur in rivers. Over time, erosion can widen the riverbank through lateral erosion, by slowly removing material from the banks, causing them to recede. 3. Land use and human activities: Human factors, such as deforestation, agriculture, or urban development, can result in changes to the natural landscape. Clearing land, for example, can result in increased surface runoff and sedimentation, which can cause the river to widen by eroding more sediment from the riverbanks. 4. Geology and bedrock composition: Rivers flow over different types of rocks and alluvial deposits. Some rocks, like limestone and shale, are softer and more susceptible to erosion than other types, like granite or basalt. This also impacts the rate of erosion and, consequently, the width of the river. 5. Climate: Rainfall and seasonal variations play an important role in determining the volume and flow of a river. Rivers in regions with wetter climates will generally have higher discharges, which can lead to wider rivers as more water flows through the channel, causing additional bank erosion. 6. River gradient (slope): The slope of a river channel is a crucial factor in determining the velocity of the water and its erosive power. Steeper slopes result in higher river velocities and intense downcutting, creating deeper channels. Conversely, flatter river gradients have slower velocities, resulting in the development of meanders and lateral erosion which may cause the river to become wider. While salinity can have an indirect effect on rivers by influencing the vegetation in and around the river, as well as the types of species that live in the river, it is not the most crucial factor determining the width of a river. Factors like discharge, erosion, land use, geology, climate, and river gradient have much more significant impacts on the width of a river."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: what's the name of the sloth in zootopia?","completion":"The name of the sloth in the animated movie \\"Zootopia\\" (2016) is Flash. Flash is a male three-toed sloth who works at the Department of Mammal Vehicles (DMV) in the city of Zootopia. Flash plays a crucial role in a scene where the main characters, Officer Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, need to get information about a missing mammal's vehicle plate number. Knowing that the DMV is notorious for its slow service, they nevertheless turn to Flash for help. Upon arriving at the DMV, they find that the employees are all sloths, which ultimately makes their mission a test of patience. Flash, portrayed by Raymond S. Persi, is known for his excessively slow speed, both in movement and speech, true to the nature of his species. Throughout the scene, despite Judy's hurry, Flash takes his time to complete even the simplest tasks, leading to a comical and entertaining scenario. Eventually, Flash's slow demeanor gets the better of Nick, who cracks a joke and causes Flash to laugh for an extended period. This scene highlights an important aspect of Zootopia – the movie delves into real-life issues like stereotypes and prejudices, reminding audiences that they can be just as harmful and frustrating as Flash's slow speed. Despite being a relatively minor character, Flash quickly became a fan favorite due to his unique charm and crucial contribution to the movie's message. His occasional appearances throughout the film further reinforce the theme that a diverse and inclusive society relies on understanding and embracing the strengths and weaknesses of its individual members. Flash's character showcases the power of animated films to resonate with audiences, providing valuable life lessons while simultaneously entertaining viewers of all ages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The 30-mile road that runs through the mountains of Willie Valley makes most drivers' hands sweat. But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Andersen had driven through the Valley hundreds of times over the years. The weather was fine. But the higher they drove, the more slippery the road became. Rounding a sharp U-turn, Andersen saw a heavy truck off the road and immediately hit his brakes. In a minute, the car was going at 25 miles per hour down the mountain before falling down from a ten-foot dam into the extremely cold Logan River. The crash had broken a few windows, and within seconds, the car was filled with water. \\"It was frightening that we were going fast into deep water,\\" remembers Andersen, a soft-spoken manager. Having lost all sense of direction, Andersen began to search the freezing water for the kids. Mia had been right next to him in the front seat; now, in the blackness, he couldn't find her. \\"I thought, if I don't get out, maybe none of us are going to get out.\\" Andersen got out of his seat belt, swam through a broken window, and, deeply and quickly, breathed air at the surface. That's when he saw a group of men, about ten in all, appear at the top of the dam. One after another, they rushed down into the water. Helping onto safety all the three children, they began to shout at the father, \\"Who else is in the car?\\" Andersen says respectfully, \\" _ .\\" Question: What might be the main cause of the car accident? - The bad weather. - The high dam. - The sudden brake. - The heavy truck. A:","completion":"The main cause of the car accident appears to be the sudden brake. The article states that while navigating the mountain road, Andersen saw a heavy truck off the road and immediately hit his brakes. This suggests that Andersen's sudden reaction to the heavy truck led to a loss of control. The vehicle then started going downhill at an uncontrolled pace, traveled off the road, fell from a dam, and entered the Logan River. While weather conditions contributed to the slipperiness of the road, and the high dam and heavy truck were definitely components, it was the sudden braking that directly initiated the chain of events leading to the accident. The article does not indicate that the heavy truck directly interfered with Andersen's vehicle, or that the dam was an unusual or unexpected infrastructure on the road.

The answer to the question: What is the location of the temple built in the style that is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features in 1200? is inside the article: The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine (vimana) is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique. The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of Soapstone (Chloritic schist), a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material.The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at Arasikere (1220), Amruthapura (1196), Belavadi (1200), Nuggehalli (1246), Hosaholalu (1250), Aralaguppe (1250), Korvangla (1173), Haranhalli (1235), Mosale and Basaralu (1234) are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples. The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics...., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"The temple you are referring to is the Chennakesava Temple, which is located in Belavadi, Karnataka, India.

Follow your dog's lead when it comes to food..","completion":"[+] As you watch, pay attention to where your dog goes and what he does. This should give you clues about his preferred method of escape. The correct answer focuses on observing the dog's movements and actions in the yard to understand how he is escaping. This is in line with the paragraph, which is about finding out how the dog gets out of the yard. The first answer is incorrect because it talks about how the dog initially gets outside, but the paragraph is about observing the dog's escape route from the yard. The second answer is wrong because it suggests using a trick like a jump bar, but this is not relevant to the main goal of observing the dog's escape route from the yard. The last answer is incorrect because it talks about the dog getting lost in the yard, which is not the main focus of the paragraph, and it also mentions following the dog's lead when it comes to food, which is irrelevant to the issue of the dog escaping the yard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: This is the most essential cooking technique you will need to know, so learn it as thoroughly as possible. You will heat a little oil in a wok or similar pan and cook food quickly over high heat. You will usually need to slice the food or shred it into small pieces. Small pieces cook faster and more evenly, which is why they are suitable for this technique. The oil is added to the preheated wok. Fragrant ingredients are cooked after that, followed by the main ingredients. Add the sauce and spices immediately before the meat browns, then remove the meat and cook any vegetables. Even though stir-frying is the cooking technique most commonly associated with Chinese foods, if you want to master Chinese cuisine, you should also learn a few other frying techniques. Quick stir-frying is similar to standard stir-frying, but you use a basic sauce to cook the ingredients instead of an oil. Flash-frying is also similar to stir-frying, but you use even higher heat to cook the food almost instantaneously. Meat is usually coated in eggs and starches to help contain the juices. Deep-frying is done in a heavy pot with a large amount of oil. This oil needs to be kept close to the smoke point throughout the cooking process, and the foods must be dry when submerged in the oil. The foods should also be cooked a little at a time and completely submerged. Paper wrapped deep-frying is similar to standard deep-frying, but small pieces of fish or meat are wrapped in cellophane before being submerged in the hot oil. Pan-frying or shallow frying is done with a small amount of oil and a low to moderate heat. Steaming is a fairly common technique and is often used when preparing lighter dishes without oil or sauce. For instance, you might prepare filled dumplings with a steamer. During the cooking process, the food must never come into direct contact with the boiling water below the steaming rack. Red cooking is fairly exclusive to Chinese cuisine. You would usually use it with large cuts of meat or poultry. During this method, you add dark soy sauce to the meat as it cooks, giving it a dark red tint. Usually, the dark soy sauce is added right after you add any water or stock to the wok. There are a handful of different cooking techniques used in Chinese cuisine that involve some form of boiling or simmering liquid. Stews are fairly common, but most Chinese stews only have meat in them instead of meat and vegetables. Traditionally, these stews would be cooked in an earthenware pot over a slow charcoal fire, and the result is a thick stew with meat that is nearly like jelly in terms of tenderness. You may blanch or poach food. During this process, food is quickly cooked in boiling water or boiling stock. Blanched foods are only in the liquid for a few brief moments, while poached foods are cooked until done. Boiled foods are cooked in boiling water, as would be expected. Multiple-item boils involve several different ingredients being boiled together. Quick-stewing is a cross between stewing and boiling. Foods are quickly cooked in boiling water or stock. A thickener is then mixed in and the contents of the pot are brought to a boil until thickened. In addition to the actual cooking techniques used when preparing Chinese food, you should also be aware of various pre-cooking practices you might expect to run across. Marinating is the most important to know. Standard marinating is used for fruits and vegetables in Chinese cuisine, and involves soaking these ingredients in wine, soy sauce, vinegar, and various seasonings. Wine-steeping is a specific type of marinating that uses some form of wine. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/10/Cook-Chinese-Food-Step-18Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Cook-Chinese-Food-Step-18Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/1/10/Cook-Chinese-Food-Step-18Bullet1.jpg/aid4005955-v4-728px-Cook-Chinese-Food-Step-18Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"} Dry-marinating is usually done with meats.

Please answer the following question: Off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island swim masses of colorful tropical fish. Some of these fish will be caught and sold, ending up in aquariums around the world. Is the industry putting populations of the fish at risk? Scientists who have studied the Big Island fishery say it is well managed. Rules put in place more than 15 years ago have helped to protect the fish. Along 35% of the coastline, for example, fish collecting is banned. Two years ago, the state cut the number of fish species for the aquarium trade from hundreds to just 40. Conservationist Robert Wintner objects to the findings. Wintner, who owns snorkel shops across Hawaii, started the Snorkel Bob Foundation to protect the island's coral reefs . He says he simply doesn't see yellow tang in the protected areas. \\"There should be millions of them,\\" he says. \\"Where are they?\\" Wintner says people believe the numbers in reports. But few people have actually dived into the coral reefs to see for themselves how many fish can be found there. According to Wintner, the coral reefs along the coast should be filled with yellow tang, but they are \\"virtually empty\\". Empty reefs are not good for tourism, Wintner points out, which brings out 800 million yearly. By contrast, the aquarium-fish trade brings out just 2 million yearly.

Please answer this question: In which Scottish city are Salisbury Crags?","completion":"Salisbury Crags are located in the Scottish city of Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland. Edinburgh is situated in the southeastern part of Scotland, along the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. This city has a rich history, and it's well-known for its beautiful architecture, historical landmarks, and cultural attractions. The Salisbury Crags are a series of impressive cliffs situated within Holyrood Park, an expansive royal park in central Edinburgh. This park is home to many natural features and remarkable geological formations. Spanning across 650 acres, Holyrood Park is under the care of the Historic Environment Scotland, an organization that maintains the park for the enjoyment of Edinburgh's residents and visitors. The Crags were formed around 350 million years ago, primarily from volcanic dolerite (a type of basalt). These cliffs offer breathtaking panoramic views of Edinburgh, including glimpses of the famous Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish Parliament building. They can be easily accessed through various paths and trails, with the Radical Road being the most famous one, built in 1820 under the direction of Scottish novelist, playwright, and poet Sir Walter Scott. Holyrood Park is also home to Arthur's Seat, the highest peak in the park and an extinct volcanic hill that rises 251 meters above sea level. Arthur's Seat is often mistaken for Salisbury Crags, but they are two distinct geographical features within the park. Both Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags play an essential role in the geological and natural history of Edinburgh and remain popular spots for outdoor enthusiasts, hikers, and tourists seeking stunning views of the city and its surroundings. In conclusion, Salisbury Crags are located in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland, within the confines of Holyrood Park.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: What colour is the mineral rock malachite?","completion":"Malachite is a mineral rock that is characterized by its striking green color, which can range from light to dark shades. Its name is derived from the Greek word \\"malache,\\" which means \\"mallow\\" - a plant known for its green leaves. This vibrant hue is primarily due to the presence of copper within the mineral's chemical composition. Malachite forms as a secondary mineral in the oxidation zones of copper ore deposits. Its chemical formula is Cu2CO3(OH)2, which reveals that it is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral. The presence of copper in the stone plays a significant role in producing the rich green color that is synonymous with malachite. The color variations in malachite can be attributed to the varying levels of copper content and the impurities present. The bands and patterns within the stone further enhance its visual appeal. These vivid green patterns and banding occur due to differences in the growth rates of the malachite crystals and differences in the concentration of copper ions. It is not uncommon to find malachite with alternating light and dark concentric circles, wavy lines, or irregular patterns throughout the stone. Some of the shades of green commonly observed in malachite include: 1. Light Green: This shade appears in samples where the copper concentration is lower, or the crystal growth is slower. It is also observed in areas with impurities that affect the brightness of the stone. 2. Medium Green: This shade generally represents the most common appearance of malachite and is usually the result of moderate copper concentration and crystal growth rates. 3. Dark Green to Almost Black: These darker shades can occur when the copper concentration in the mineral is high, or impurities interacting with the copper ions create a darker hue. In addition to its stunning color, malachite has been prized for thousands of years for its ornamental and decorative qualities. Artifacts made from malachite date back to ancient Egypt, where the stone was used for jewelry, amulets, and cosmetics. It was also highly valued by civilizations such as the Greeks and Romans, who believed it possessed protective and healing properties. Today, malachite is widely used as a gemstone, especially for beads, cabochons, and ornamental carvings. Its attractive patterns and rich green color make it ideal for use in jewelry design. Moreover, it is also considered a popular decorative stone used in architecture, sculptures, and other home décor items. However, it is essential to care for malachite items properly, as they are sensitive to heat, acids, and abrasive materials, which can cause the remarkable green color to fade or become damaged. In summary, the mineral rock malachite is characterized by its vibrant green color, which can range from light to dark shades. The presence of copper within the mineral, along with varying concentrations and impurities, can create the diverse tones and patterns observed in this eye-catching gemstone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, the battery life was subpar, lasting only 4 hours on a single charge, which is far below the industry standard for wireless headphones. This makes it inconvenient to use them on long trips or for extended periods of listening. The comfort of the headphones was also an issue. After just 30 minutes of use, I found the earpads to be quite uncomfortable and they put pressure on my ears, making it unbearable to wear them for extended periods of listening.

TEXT:So many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so I duly responded. Here are some remarks.. Vanessa Redgrave is great even while lying in bed. She also looks very old and I don't think this is achieved with much make-up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema-goers. I think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years. Claire Danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth. Mamie Gummer's resemblance to her mother Merly Streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that I lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance. She is surprisingly good; however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor. I agree with a previous comment: Natasha Richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face. She certainly does not look like how I remember her from previous films (\\"Nell\\" for example.) Both she and Toni Collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters. Their interplay is weak. Toni Collette additionally is way too old for her character. Glenn Close and Meryl Streep had to have more screen time. Streep's performance actually is little more than a cameo. Her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film. Eileen Atkins provides some welcome dry wit, especially in her second role as an imaginary nighttime companion to Redgrave's character. As for the men; Hugh Dancy enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed. As a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag. It is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of boyish charm in the viewer. Patrick Wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film. He also has the misfortune that the script is insufficient in explaining why three people (one of them a man) are so much smitten by this man. The backstory to this should have been developed more. The cinematography is excellent as expected. However the main summer house set failed to convince me. It does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill, particularly with its grass patch in the front. A bit too cardboard like. Overall, the film is a classy production, but a seen-it-all-before, cried-at-it-all-before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that I expected from a tearjerker.

Teacher:In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: The film opens to the sound of a gramophone playing Axxon N, \\"the longest-running radio play in history\\". Meanwhile, a young prostitute, identified in the credits as the \\"Lost Girl\\", cries while watching television in a hotel room, following an unpleasant encounter with her client. The Lost Girlâs television displays a family of surrealistic anthropomorphic rabbits who speak in cryptic statements and questions. Occasionally, there are laugh track responses within these Rabbit scenes. These three elements become recurring motifs throughout Inland Empire.The main plot follows an actress named Nikki Grace (Dern), who has applied for a comeback role as Sue in a film entitled On High in Blue Tomorrows. The day before the audition, Nikki is visited by an enigmatic old woman (Zabriskie) who says she is her neighbor; she predicts that Nikki will get the role, and recounts two folk tales. One tells of a boy who, sparking a reflection after passing through a doorway, \\"caused evil to be born.\\" The other tells of a girl who, wandering through an alleyway behind a marketplace, \\"discovers a palace.\\" The old woman presses Nikki for details on her new film, asking whether the story is about marriage and involves murder. Nikki denies both, but her neighbor disagrees. Disregarding Nikki's offended response, the old woman comments on the confusion of time, claiming that were this tomorrow, Nikki would be sitting on a couch adjacent to them. The film then pans to where the neighbor is pointing, and we see Nikki and two girlfriends sitting on the couch. Her butler (Ian Abercrombie) walks into the living room with a phone call from her agent, announcing that she has won the role. Ecstatic, Nikki and her friends celebrate while her husband Piotrek (Peter J. Lucas) ominously surveys them from atop a nearby staircase.Some time later, Nikki and her co-star Devon Berk (Theroux) receive an interview on a talk show. The host (Ladd) asks them both whether they are having an affair, to which each of them respond negatively. Devon is warned by his entourage that Nikki is out of bounds, due to her husband's power and influence. Later, on the set being built for the film, Nikki and Devon rehearse a scene with the director, Kingsley Stewart (Irons). They are interrupted by a disturbance, but upon investigation Devon finds nothing. Shaken by the event, Kingsley confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German feature entitled 47. Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumors of the film being cursed.Immersed in her character, while the film is being shot, \\"Sue\\" / Nikki appears to begin an affair with Devon / \\"Billy\\". A strange scene follows based on what the old woman had described: Nikki appears in a mysterious alley walking to her car, carrying a bag of groceries, but then she notices a door in the alley marked Axxon N, and enters. It leads her back to soundstage where the earlier rehearsal took place. She witnesses that rehearsal from across the roomââshe herself was what had interrupted it earlier. This time, when Devon seeks to discover who's observing them, she disappears from the rehearsal scene, and flees among the half-built backgrounds and into the house of a character named Smithy (possibly her husband in the film's story, but this is never made clear). Despite the set being merely a wooden facade, Nikki enters to find an illuminated suburban house inside. Devon looks through the windows, but sees only darkness, not hearing her frantic cries of his character's name, \\"Billy.\\"At this point, the film takes a drastic stylistic turn. Various plotlines and scenes begin to entwine and complement each other. The chronological order is often confused or nonexistent. Inside the house, Nikki sees her husband (whether it's \\"Smithy\\" or Piotrek is unclear) in bed. Hiding from him, she enters a different room and encounters a troupe of prostitutes. One of the women advises her to burn a hole through silk with a cigarette and look through the hole. Nikki complies and witnesses several strange happenings, many of which seem to revolve around her, or alternate versions of herself.Prior to these scenes, the woman who plays Billyâs wife tells a policeman that she had been hypnotised to murder someone with a screwdriver, but finds the screwdriver embedded in her own side. A mysterious organization claims to have captives from Inland Empire. A parallel plotline involves Polish circus artists in the present day, as well as Polish prostitutes in ÅÃ³dÅº during the 1930s, who are confronted by strange pimps while murder permeates their city. Nikki, having become one of the group of present-day prostitutes, wanders the streets while her companions ask, \\"Who is she?\\" Both Nikki and her prostitutes frequently ask people to look at them and \\"say whether you've known me before.\\" In a parallel plotline, Sue climbs the dark staircase behind a nightclub to deliver long monologues to an unidentified man touching upon her childhood sexual abuse, disastrous relationships, and retaliations. Her husband Smithy seems to be connected with both the pimps and the organization, and then is hired by a circus from Poland because he is said to be \\"good with animals.\\" There is much talk of the Phantom, an elusive hypnotist. Convinced sheâs being stalked by a red-lipped man, Sue arms herself with a screwdriver.Finally, Sue walks down Hollywood Boulevard, and is startled to see her doppelgÃ¤nger across the street. Before Sue can investigate, Doris arrives and attempts to kill her, having been hypnotized by The Phantom. Sue is brutally stabbed in the stomach with her own screwdriver, causing her to stagger down the street and eventually collapse next to some homeless people on the corner of Hollywood and Vine. One woman remarks that Sue is dying, then proceeds to debate with another, younger homeless woman about taking a bus to Pomona. Her companion talks at length about a friend named Niko, a prostitute whose blond wig makes her look like a movie star, thus allowing her to walk through the rich district without drawing attention. The older woman comforts Sue by holding a lighter in front of her face until she finally dies, promising her \\"no more blue tomorrows.\\" Off-camera, Kingsley yells \\"Cut!\\" and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.As the actors and film crew wrap for the next scene, Sue slowly arises, Nikki once more. Kingsley announces that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only On High in Blue Tomorrowsâencompassing some of the subplots of the filmâbut events that are currently occurring. She wanders to the projection room, but finds an apartment building marked \\"Axxon N\\". Eventually, Nikki confronts the red-lipped man from earlier, now known to be the Phantom. She shoots him, which causes his face to morph first into a distorted copy of Nikki's own face, and then an even more distorted face bleeding from its mouth.Nikki flees into a nearby roomâRoom 47, which houses the rabbits on television, though she fails to see them. Elsewhere in the building, Nikki finds the Lost Girl, who has been watching and crying all along. The two women kiss, before Nikki fades away into the light along with the rabbits. The Lost Girl runs out of the hotel and into Smithy's house, where she happily embraces a man and child.Nikki is then seen back home, smiling at the old woman from the beginning of the film. The concluding scene takes place at her house, where she sits with many other people, among them Laura Harring, Nastassja Kinski, and Ben Harper. A one-legged woman who was mentioned in Sue's monologue looks around and says, \\"Sweet!\\" Niko, the girl with the blonde wig and monkey, can also be seen. The end credits roll over a group of women dancing to Nina Simone's \\"Sinner Man\\" while a lumberjack saws a log to the beat., Question: What type of animal is present at Nikki's house at the end of the movie, accompanying Niko, the woman with the blond wig?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

They argue two thirds of injuries in youth rugby and most concussions are down to tackles and urge schools to move to touch and non-contact rugby. Supporters say rugby builds character and other forms are less challenging. The concerns have been raised as a seven-year programme headed by the Rugby Football Union is on target to introduce rugby to a million children in state schools across England. The RFU's programme, which began in 2012 and is running until 2019, has so far reached 400 schools, with 350 to follow. But, in their letter to ministers, chief medical officers and children's commissioners in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, doctors say the risks for players aged under 18 are high. They say many secondary schools in the UK deliver contact rugby as a compulsory part of the physical education curriculum from the age of 11. \\"The majority of all injuries occur during contact or collision, such as the tackle and the scrum,\\" the letter says. \\"These injuries, which include fractures, ligamentous tears, dislocated shoulders, spinal injuries and head injuries can have short-term, lifelong and life-ending consequences for children.\\" The doctors say concussion is a common injury, and they highlight a link between \\"repeat concussions and cognitive impairment and an association with depression, memory loss and diminished verbal abilities\\". One of the signatories of the open letter is Prof Allyson Pollock, from Queen Mary University of London, who has long campaigned about the dangers of rugby. She said evidence collected over 12 years showed rugby players up to the age of 18 or 19 had a 28% chance of getting injured over a season of 15 matches. \\"If you're thinking of a million children playing every year with this risk of injury you're looking at 300,000 extra injuries a year, including up to 100,000 concussions,\\" she said. She added that 90% of injuries resulted in more than seven days lost from school. There are various forms of touch or tag rugby, in which tackles are replaced by touching a player or removing a tag from their clothing. Aspects of rugby such as scrums and rucks are also excluded from these forms of the game. Jonny Cross, a PE teacher at Congleton High School in Cheshire - where rugby is compulsory from the age of 11 - says the sport provides a challenge. Mr Cross says children wear gum-shields and are taught how to maintain the proper posture in scrums to avoid injury, a technique known as \\"tower of power\\". \\"Contact rugby helps build character. They are putting their body on the line in a match. The risk factor is part of it,\\" he says. \\"They enjoy the contact element. There is a 'boy factor' - it's partly about developing masculinity. They would be more likely to be bored by touch rugby. \\"I would say that some students need it. It provides a challenge, where challenge is being taken out of everyday life.\\" Parents and pupils on tackling in rugby The RFU and the Welsh Rugby Union both said they took player safety \\"extremely seriously\\" but that rugby was a \\"fantastic sport for children\\" which offered many benefits for society. The Scottish Rugby Union said it was \\"committed to player welfare at every level of the game\\" but pointed out that every sport carried \\"an element of risk\\". South African schools allow tackling, as do schools in Australia - although there has been a recent push to make children wear protective headgear, but this is not compulsory. In New Zealand, tackling is permitted, but in some schools it is banned in lunchtime games that are not being supervised. Former England rugby player Matt Perry said: \\"I took a risk when I started rugby at seven and I'm afraid at school level if that tackle is taken out we've lost one of the great games and one of the great cultural games.\\" Former England international Brian Moore dismissed the evidence in the letter as \\"flawed\\" and \\"partial\\". Obesity would kill more children than rugby, he said. \\"If you want to ban things, you've got to do it on the right basis.\\" The Association for Physical Education said contact versions of the game should be introduced and managed only by \\"suitably experienced staff\\" following recognised guidelines. \\"Parents should be aware of what sports are taught in the schools they choose to send their children to - if rugby is taught, then parents send their children to the school in the knowledge that they are likely to be asked to play rugby at some level,\\" it added. A spokesman for the Department for Education in England said: \\"Team sports, such as rugby, play an important role in developing character. \\"We expect schools to be aware of the risks associated with sporting activities and to provide a safe environment for pupils.\\"","completion":"Some doctors are worried that kids who play rugby might get hurt because of how the game involves a lot of tackling and collisions. They think it would be better for schools to teach touch rugby instead, which doesn't have tackling. Rugby supporters argue that the traditional version of the game helps kids build their character and overcome challenges. Rugby organizations say they care about player safety but also think that rugby is a great sport for kids to play and has many benefits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Creatine kinase Creatine kinase (CK), also known as creatine phosphokinase (CPK) or phosphocreatine kinase, is an enzyme (EC 2.7.3.2) expressed by various tissues and cell types. CK catalyses the conversion of creatine and utilizes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to create phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This CK enzyme reaction is reversible and thus ATP can be generated from PCr and ADP. Is this statement correct \\"is a cpk the same as a ck\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"is a CPK the same as a CK\\" is correct. Creatine kinase (CK) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are two names for the same enzyme. Creatine kinase plays an essential role in energy metabolism in muscle and nerve cells. It is found in various isoenzymes in tissues such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain. The different isoenzymes are CK-MM (Muscle type), CK-MB (Myocardial bound type), and CK-BB (Brain type). The primary function of creatine kinase is to maintain ATP levels in energy-demanding cells by catalyzing a rapid and reversible reaction, as follows: Creatine + ATP ⇌ Phosphocreatine + ADP In this reaction, creatine kinase transfers a phosphate group from ATP to creatine, producing phosphocreatine and ADP. Phosphocreatine serves as a high-energy reserve in cells and can rapidly donate its phosphate group to ADP, regenerating ATP. This process occurs mainly in muscles during contraction and in nerve cells when energy demands are high. The CK enzyme levels can be measured in the blood, and elevated levels often indicate muscle damage or injury. For instance, CK-MB isoenzyme is often assessed in patients with suspected myocardial infarction (heart attack), as its elevation in the bloodstream can signify damage to cardiac muscles. However, it is important to note that elevated CK levels are not exclusive to myocardial infarction, and other factors like intense exercise and certain medications can also result in increased CK levels. In summary, creatine kinase (CK) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are two names for the same enzyme involved in energy metabolism, particularly in muscle and nerve cells. The primary role of CK/CPK is to catalyze the reversible transfer of phosphate groups between creatine and ATP, allowing for rapid energy transfer in high-energy-demanding cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. and a hint : Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

The Power of Kangwon Province is director Hong Sang-Soo's second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film, including the multiple connected narratives (in this case, two), and stories of troubled or troubling relationships, as well as a potent dosage of irony. One thing that's clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism. However, this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein. The two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with her friends, only to find herself drawn to a stranger, the second about a man who also goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woes. Again, Hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet I don't think he's entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters, drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony. I think the think I've come to love about Hong's films is that they just feel so real, especially the complex and conflicted characters. Not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings, but rather, that these characters he and the actors present, feel fully developed and believable. This is not a fast moving film. There's a lot of lingering and like the previous film, things don't always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways. There doesn't appear to be any element of the film that isn't intentionally placed in the film and it's made my a little hyper-aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progresses. Power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion, regret, longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision-making. It's a rather hard balance to keep and it's surprising how Hong manages to pull it off twice in a row. Technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear. This film doesn't pack the same emotional wallop that the first does, but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision.

When the man initially conceived the idea to introduce the rock into the aquarium, he believed it would be a valuable addition to the underwater environment he had so carefully crafted for his fish. Known for their aesthetic appeal and natural aesthetic contributions, rocks are commonly used in aquariums to emulate the fish's natural habitat, provide hiding spots for the more timid species, and to anchor plants and decorations. As the man attempted to gently place the rock into the aquarium, he quickly began to realize that its size was much larger than he had initially anticipated. Given that the rock occupied a significant portion of the limited space available within the confines of the tank, the displacement of water became a significant issue. As the rock continued its descent, the water level within the aquarium rose steadily and rapidly, much to the man's increasing dismay. Unprepared for such an event, he found himself unable to prevent the impending deluge. Water spilled out from the tank, sloshing onto the surrounding surfaces and creating slippery puddles on the floor. The man found himself in a precarious situation, both frustrated and concerned for the well-being of his aquatic companions. Desperate to avert a complete disaster, the man quickly removed the rock from the aquarium, causing another wave of water to spill out and exacerbate the already messy situation. After assessing the damage and concluding that his fish were unharmed, the man couldn't help but feel a sense of relief mixed with embarrassment over his miscalculation in judgment. In the aftermath of the ordeal, the man took great care to clean up the mess, mopping up the water that had soaked the surrounding area and wiping down any surfaces that had gotten wet. With the aquarium now safe and secure, and the fish no worse for wear, the man decided it would be wise to conduct more thorough research on suitable rocks and aquarium design before undertaking any similar endeavors in the future. As the sun set and the room grew dim, the fishes swam peacefully in their watery world, unaware of the tumultuous events that had transpired that day — a testament to the resilience of nature and the well-intentioned, if somewhat clumsy, actions of a dedicated and caring aquatic enthusiast.

When he looks back at the bonfire, the bonfire is (A) brighter (B) dimmer Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"distant bonfire\\" and \\"close bonfire\\". Answer:","completion":"When Aiden walks away from the bonfire and into the woods at night, the bonfire he looks back at would appear as a \\"distant bonfire.\\" This is because, as he moves further away from the bonfire, the light from the fire would appear to be dimmer compared to when he was closer to it. The perception of the bonfire's brightness changing is due to the Inverse Square Law, which states that the intensity of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of light. In simpler terms, as the distance between Aiden and the bonfire increases, the amount of light that reaches him decreases. When Aiden was close to the bonfire, he was receiving more of the light energy emitted by the fire. As he moves away from the bonfire, the intensity of the light reaching him diminishes because the light is spread over a larger area. This makes the bonfire seem dimmer as he moves further into the woods. Other factors like ambient lighting, the presence of smoke, or the presence of trees and other obstacles between Aiden and the bonfire could also slightly alter his perception of the brightness. Additionally, our eyes adapt to different lighting conditions, which can affect our perception of brightness. When Aiden moves into the woods, his eyes have to adjust to the darker environment, making the bonfire appear even dimmer when he looks back. In conclusion, when Aiden walks away from the bonfire and into the woods at night, he would perceive the bonfire as a \\"distant bonfire\\" due to the decreased intensity of the light reaching him and his eyes adapting to the darker environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a fluid-filled body cavity that is completely enclosed by mesoderm. The coelom lies between the digestive cavity and body wall. You can see it in the invertebrate in Figure below . Modern invertebrates with a coelom include mollusks (Phylum Mollusca) and annelids (Phylum Annelida). Q: What is a fluid-filled body cavity that is completely enclosed by mesoderm called? A: Answer:","completion":"The fluid-filled body cavity that is completely enclosed by mesoderm is called a coelom. A coelom is a significant evolutionary development in animals, providing several physiological advantages. It lies between the body wall and the digestive cavity, serving to house and protect the internal organs. It also provides the organisms with flexibility and eases their movements. Many modern invertebrates contain a coelom. These include species belonging to Phylum Mollusca and Phylum Annelida. Mollusks, for instance, include animals such as snails, octopuses, and clams. They typically have a soft unsegmented body and usually have a hard shell, either exterior or interior. Their coelom performs numerous functions including accommodating the heart, gonads, and parts of the excretory system. Annelids, on the other hand, include species like earthworms or leeches. They have segmented bodies, each of which contains a portion of the coelom. The coelomic fluid within these segments helps maintain the body structure of the annelid, allows for storage and transport of nutrients and waste products, and also assists in their locomotion. One should note that the presence of a coelom is a characteristic feature of higher order, more complex animals and is not present in simpler organisms. The evolution of the coelom is seen to have played a significant role in the advancement and diversification of animal body plans and complexities. Thus, the coelom, this fluid-filled body cavity enclosed by mesoderm, is quite an important structure in the study of animal anatomy and evolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you don't naturally have back dimples at all, the only way to get them is with cosmetic surgery. This is accomplished by removing fat from the areas where you would like the dimples to appear. Traditionally, this is done with liposuction, in which a needle is inserted under the skin and a little bit of fat is suctioned out. The liposuction procedure used specifically to create back dimples may go by a variety names, including V-spot treatment, Dimples En V, or Barbie Back surgery. This type of liposuction is usually performed under local anesthesia. Possible risks of liposuction include numbness around the liposuction site, infection of the skin, bleeding, or fat embolism (a blood vessel blockage caused by a loose piece of fat). Deoxycholic acid (Kybella) can be injected under the skin to dissolve fat without damaging the surrounding tissues. Targeted injections can be used to simulate back dimples. Deoxycholic injections require less downtime and are less expensive than liposuction, but you may need several treatments to get the results you want. Common side effects of Kybella injections include swelling, bruising, pain, numbness, redness, and hardening of the tissue around the injection. Kybella is only FDA approved for treatment of fat below the chin. However, cosmetic practitioners may still legally use it for off-label uses, such as creating back dimples. Cosmetic surgery to create back dimples can be extremely expensive. If you go the liposuction route, you could be looking at around 6000 USD. While a single treatment with Kybella costs less than liposuction, you may need multiple treatments. Because of this, Kybella can add up to about the same or even more than what you would pay for liposuction. Most insurance plans will not cover the costs of these types of procedures, so you will almost certainly have to pay the whole cost out of pocket.","completion":"This article discusses acquiring back dimples through cosmetic surgery, specifically using liposuction techniques or deoxycholic acid injections (Kybella), with both options posing potential risks, side effects, and expenses, as they are not typically covered by insurance plans."},{"prompt":"Question: Process: - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion - Question: suppose more digestion occurs happens, how will it affect LESS digestion occuring.

Article: Vanita Gupta, the acting head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said it’s “for the city and the community in Ferguson to decide what they want” to happen with the police force there. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) A team of Justice Department civil rights lawyers is planning to travel to Ferguson, Mo., in the coming weeks to meet with residents and help decide whether to reform the police department or disband it and replace it with a regional force, according to the head of the department’s civil rights division. In her first wide-ranging interview since taking over the civil rights division last fall, acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta said that her lawyers want to ensure that the systemic racial bias and constitutional violations identified in the scathing Justice report on the Ferguson Police Department “don’t continue for a day longer than they should.” “What kind of police department do Ferguson residents want?” said Gupta, a longtime civil rights lawyer and former deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “All of the options are on the table. And now, we’re going to roll up our sleeves and figure out, ‘what does this look like?’ Some of what has happened in the last week really demonstrates the urgency of putting together an agreement.” Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said he will resign Thursday. The announcement came a day after Ferguson’s city manager resigned and two days after the city’s top municipal court judge also stepped aside. Shortly after Ferguson’s mayor announced Jackson’s resignation, two police officers were shot outside the police department. Jeffrey Williams, 20, was arrested late Saturday and charged in the shooting. During a brief public appearance Monday at the St. Louis county courthouse, Williams told the judge he would seek private counsel and not use a public defender, according to Stephen Reynolds, who is the chief public defender in St. Louis County. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said last week that he would step down March 19 shortly after the city’s manager resigned and two days after the city’s top municipal court judge also stepped aside. (Scott Olson/Getty) Williams had previously been on probation in relation to a felony charge of receiving stolen property. On Monday morning, a woman who identified herself as Williams’s grandmother answered the door at the address listed as his home in court documents. She said Williams, who has two small children and a third on the way, did not graduate high school and did not have a steady job. She said she last saw him on Friday and was concerned when she saw red marks across his face in his mug shot. “The police beat him up,” she said, repeating an assertion made by a pastor and protest organizer who said he spoke with Williams. St. Louis County police have denied that Williams was beaten. Williams’s grandmother said she was struggling to figure out how her grandson could have been accused of the shooting. “We raised him right.” Gupta said the Justice Department “will flood the community in an intense way to make sure that we understand and are hearing from law enforcement leaders and line officers, city officials, and the community. “Frankly, it isn’t for the Justice Department to decide what this looks like,” she said. “It’s for the city and the community in Ferguson to decide what they want. We think this could be done in a matter of months, but it depends on the ability of the city to engage with us in a serious way.” Demonstrators argue during a protest outside the Ferguson, Mo. police station on March 15, the day the St. Louis County prosecutor announced that Jeffrey Williams was arrested for the shooting of two police officers who were working during a protest last week. (Scott Olson/Getty) If the Justice Department does not come to an agreement with the city of Ferguson about the future of the police department, it can sue to force change, as it has in other cases. Gupta, only five months into the job, is well positioned to help lead negotiations with Ferguson city officials, a process that began after the fatal shooting in August of Michael Brown, an unarmed African American man, by a white Ferguson police officer. The youngest of two daughters of Indian parents who immigrated to the United States in the late 1960s, Gupta has devoted her career to civil rights issues and criminal justice reform. She grew up in Philadelphia and went to Yale University, where she was co-chair of the Women’s Center and was also involved in labor and immigrant rights issues. (Her husband is the legal director of the D.C. Legal Aid Society.) After graduating from New York University Law School, her first legal case for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund was an effort to win the release of 38 defendants in Tulia, Tex., whose drug convictions and long sentences were discredited by her legal team. Gov. Rick Perry in 2003 pardoned all of the defendants, and Gupta helped negotiate a 6 million settlement for the defendants. Later, at the ACLU, she won a landmark settlement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency on behalf of immigrant children detained at T. Don Hutto, a privately run detention center in Taylor, Tex., which ended “family detention” at the facility. On the wall of Gupta’s Justice Department office overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue are four pictures drawn by immigrant children she represented while they were held inside the Texas facility. Her work in criminal justice reform has attracted, as she said, “unusual bedfellows.” Both Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, and David Keene, former president of the National Rifle Association, have praised Gupta, reflecting both her effort to listen to all sides and also a common ground that both liberals and conservatives are finding on issues such as prison reform. Gupta, the mother of two young boys, is overseeing many other kinds of civil rights cases, including litigation on voting rights and on LGBT rights. But the effort to reform Ferguson is getting the most attention, overshadowing even the division’s work to reform more than 20 other police departments in places such as Albuquerque, N.M.; East Haven, Conn.; Cleveland; and New Orleans. “With the report on Ferguson,” said Gupta, “we’ve been able to paint a broader picture of what’s happening in this town’s criminal justice system that resonates with a lot of communities of color in the way that they experience courts and police around the country.” Robert Samuels in Ferguson, Mo., contributed to this report. ||||| St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch conducts a news conference as Sunday, March 15, 2015, in Clayton, Mo. McCulloch said 20-year-old Jeffrey Williams has been charged with two counts of first-degree... (Associated Press) CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) — A man accused of shooting two officers last week in Ferguson was not targeting police or aiming at demonstrators at a late-night protest, his attorney said as he countered an earlier police description of the crime. Defense attorney Jerryl Christmas also suggested Monday that St. Louis County police may have used excessive force when arresting the suspect, Jeffrey Williams, saying his client had bruises on his back, shoulders and face and a knot on his head. Police spokesman Brian Schellman called the lawyer's allegations \\"completely false,\\" adding that Williams was seen by a nurse when booked into the county jail, standard procedure for all incoming inmates. \\"The nurse released Williams as fit for confinement,\\" he said. Williams is accused of shooting the two officers early Thursday outside Ferguson's police station, which has been the scene of protests since last summer's fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Williams, 20, appeared in court Monday, one day after his arrest on charges of felony assault, armed criminal action and a weapons offense. His case was continued until March 31. Christmas did not appear at the brief hearing and said he first spoke with his client late Monday afternoon. \\"This wasn't any type of ambush shooting,\\" Christmas said in an interview with The Associated Press, countering an earlier description by St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar of the March 12 shooting outside Ferguson police headquarters. \\"Those officers were shot accidentally.\\" Williams told investigators he was not targeting law enforcement and had been aiming instead at someone with whom he had a dispute, authorities said. But that assertion was met with skepticism by St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch. \\"We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,\\" the prosecutor said Sunday. Christmas said he wasn't aware of any details regarding a possible dispute that could have preceded the shooting. The shooting happened as a demonstration began to break up. The protest followed the resignation of city Police Chief Tom Jackson in the wake of a Justice Department report that found widespread racial bias in the city's police practices. Christmas said his client was not a regular participant in Ferguson demonstrations, echoing statements by protest leaders who said they did not recognize Williams as one of their own. \\"That little strip has become the hang-out spot,\\" Christmas said, noting that the area has attracted people besides demonstrators. Williams is jailed on 300,000 bond. Christmas said his client is unemployed and expecting a child with his girlfriend. On Monday, no one answered the door of the north St. Louis County home Williams listed as his address on court records, and several neighbors said they did not know him. The home is about 5 miles northeast of the Ferguson Police Department. According to 2014 county court records, Williams lived in nearby Jennings, which borders Ferguson. No one answered the door there either. Online state court records show a man by the name of Jeffrey Williams at the address police provided Sunday was charged in 2013 with receiving stolen property and fraudulent use of a credit/debit device. Belmar had said the two officers easily could have been killed. A 41-year-old St. Louis County officer was shot in the right shoulder, the bullet exiting through his back. A 32-year-old officer from Webster Groves was shot in the right cheek, just below the eye, and the bullet lodged behind his ear. The officers were released from the hospital hours after the attack. The Ferguson Police Department has been a national focal point since Brown, who was black and unarmed, was killed by police officer Darren Wilson, who is white. A grand jury declined to indict Wilson in November, and Wilson was cleared of civil rights charges by a Justice Department report released March 4. Wilson resigned in November. A separate Justice Department report found widespread racial bias in the city's policing and in a municipal court system driven by profit extracted from mostly black and low-income residents. ___ Associated Press writers Jim Salter in St. Louis and Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report. ||||| That's how police are responding to allegations that they beat the man arrested for shooting two police officers during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, last week. Jeffrey Williams, 20, has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity. Police have said he admitted to firing the shots that struck the officers. But Williams' lawyer says he has little confidence in such statements. \\"He's scared. You know, this has been pretty traumatic for him,\\" attorney Jerryl Christmas said about his client on Monday. \\"One thing that is clear is that he has a large amount of bruising on his body that I noticed that I'm very concerned about. It appears that whatever statements he made, he was without the advice of counsel, and when I look at the bruising, it's hard for me assess if these were voluntary statements that he made.\\" Christmas told CNN that Williams has bruising across his back, and a knot on his head. \\"He said he was bruised by the police when he was taken into custody. And he was in a lot of pain when he was being questioned,\\" Christmas said. \\"They used a lot of force on him.\\" Police deny the accusation. \\"With regard to the allegations that Jeffrey Williams was 'beaten' by police, the St. Louis County Police Department calls these allegations completely false,\\" Sgt. Brian Schellman said in a statement. \\"Immediately following the arrest, arresting officers transported Williams to St. Louis County Police Headquarters where he was interviewed by Crimes Against Persons Detectives. This entire interview was video and audio recorded.\\" Schellman also said that Williams was seen by a nurse, who released Williams as \\"fit for confinement.\\" Williams is being held on a cash-only 300,000 bond, according to St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, who said it's possible Williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case.

This means that when she rubs her sandpaper over the _____ more friction is experienced (A) mahogany or the (B) birc Choose the answer between \\"mahogany\\" and \\"birch\\".","completion":"The answer to the logic test is (A) mahogany. To provide a detailed explanation, let's first understand the meaning of roughness and friction. Roughness refers to the surface texture of an object or material consisting of small, irregular bumps or grooves. Friction, on the other hand, is the resistive force that opposes the relative motion between two objects or surfaces. In this logic test, Mary learned that mahogany is rougher than birch. In other words, the surface of mahogany has more small, irregular bumps and grooves compared to that of birch. Consequently, when Mary rubs her sandpaper over the two surfaces, more friction will be experienced on the rougher surface, which in this case is mahogany. This is because the roughness causes a higher number of contact points between the sandpaper and the wood surface, which results in an increased resistive force (or friction). Moreover, when sanding wood surfaces, the goal is typically to smoothen out the texture and even out the surface. Given the rougher nature of mahogany compared to birch, it might require more effort and time to achieve the desired smoothness through sanding. In some cases, it might also require a change in the type or grit of the sandpaper to produce the best results. It is worth noting that the natural differences in wood grain and surface texture make each type of wood suitable for specific applications and woodworking projects. Mahogany, for instance, is often valued for its durability and dimensional stability, while birch is known for its smooth finish and straight grain, which makes it easier to work with. In summary, based on the given information that mahogany is rougher than birch, the answer to the logic test is (A) mahogany, as rubbing sandpaper over its surface will result in more friction compared to rubbing it over the surface of birch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Victoria decided to choose express shipping while Katrina did not, so","completion":"Victoria's package arrived on her doorstep several days before Katrina's. Both of them had ordered the same products from an online store, as a result of their shared excitement after experiencing the product demonstration at a recent trade show. The item in question was a state-of-the-art wireless headphone set by a company called \\"SoundWave,\\" which had received rave reviews for its incredible sound quality and user-friendly features. For Victoria, the decision to pay extra for express shipping was a deliberate one. She is well-organized and attentive to her schedule, and she knew that she would be flying to a conference in a few days. As a frequent traveler, she could not wait to use her new headphones for the long flight. The extra cost for the expedited mail service justified the soon-to-be-realized relaxation during her trip. On the other hand, Katrina is known for her laid-back and patient attitude towards most things in life. While she was equally excited for the headphones, she didn't see the need to spend extra on shipping, believing that the regular delivery speed should suffice. Furthermore, her schedule in the coming days had no essential events that warranted the necessity for swift package arrival. When Victoria's package arrived at her door, she gingerly unboxed the wireless headphones with the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas morning. Eager to test her new audio gear, she connected them to her smartphone, marveling at their sleek design and intuitive set-up process. The first song she played filled her ears with clear, crisp sounds, the bass resonating and powerful, the treble and mid-tones exquisitely balanced. Her investment in express shipping seemed entirely worth it as she reveled in her new gadget. As Victoria was enjoying the company of her new headphones, Katrina watched her tracking updates diligently, anticipating the arrival of her package. It was not until four days later that her wireless headphones finally arrived. Even though she did not get to enjoy the headphones as early as Victoria, she found satisfaction in knowing she had saved some money by opting for standard shipping. With each passing day, both Victoria and Katrina continued to discover incredible features that made their new wireless headphones indispensable. Apart from the unparalleled sound quality, the headphones have advanced noise cancellation capabilities, which allowed them to work or relax in even the noisiest environments. Bluetooth connectivity meant they could walk and roam about their house or workspace without limits, as they were no longer tethered to devices via cables. The battery life turned out to be surprisingly impressive and their intuitive controls simplified adjusting the volume and switching between songs. In the weeks that followed, Victoria and Katrina agreed that investing in the SoundWave wireless headphones was one of the best decisions they had made in recent months. As for their choices in shipping, each of them was content with their respective decisions. Victoria's choice of express shipping allowed her to enjoy her new headphones during her conference trip and provided her with the comfort she sought on long flights, while Katrina's patience allowed her to save money without sacrificing any of the benefits they both reaped from their new gadgets. Ultimately, both Victoria and Katrina understood that everybody has different preferences and priorities in life. Victoria's need for speed and Katrina's cost-consciousness reflect the balance of priorities inherent in each individual.

Article: LONDON---The International Table Tennies Federation(ITTF) plans to work with Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft Corporation, to promote table tennis in the United States, ITTF President Adham Sharara said. The plan was put forward after Gates came to London to watch the game between US teen player Ariel Hsing and Chinese Li Xiaoxia on Sunday, Sharara told Xinhua in an interview. Sharara didn't disclose the details, but said that Gates offered to help after watching Hsing's match, in which the 16-year-old girl nearly pulled off one of the biggest upsets in Olympic table tennis history, pushing No. 2 seed Li to the limit before losing 4-2 in six tight sets. \\"Gates was surprised to see the young American girl played so well. He asked me what he can do to help promote table tennis in the United States. I think we'll work with him. If the United States becomes very strong in table tennis, it's also good for China,\\" Sharara said. Sharara said the case is a \\"good example\\" which shows that ITTF's efforts in promoting the popularity. The ITTF has changed its rules for the London Games, allowing only two players from one nation to enter the singles events.

Sharara said the change increased the pressure on strong teams, like China, Japan, South Korea and Germany. \\"But they understand now because they saw other NOCs attending. Some countries before had no chance to play in table tennis, but now they are joining in table tennis.\\" Other changes made to the Olympic Games include the color of floor (from red to blue) and new table design. \\"As far as presentation is concerned, we try to change all the time, especially in the Olympic Games.

Write an article based on this \\"Measure your neck. Measure your waist. Measure your hips. Measure your height. Enter your recorded data into the correct equation. Interpret your results.\\"","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Using Body Measurements for Better Health Introduction In today's fast-paced world, it has become increasingly important to take charge of one's health and wellness. One valuable tool for doing so is learning how to accurately measure and analyze our body's dimensions. This article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to take the essential body measurements, input them into the correct equation, and interpret the results in order to better understand your health and body. By understanding how to accurately measure your body, you can gain insights into areas of improvement for your overall health and fitness. Step 1: Measure your neck Neck circumference is an important measurement to take, as it can indicate issues related to sleep apnea, hypertension, and other health problems. To measure your neck, follow these steps: 1. Locate the midpoint of your neck, which is typically about one inch below the Adam's apple for men, and slightly lower for women. 2. Wrap a flexible measuring tape around your neck, making sure it is parallel to the ground and snug against your skin, without being too tight. 3. Record the measurement in inches or centimeters. Step 2: Measure your waist Waist circumference is related to overall body fat distribution. A larger waist circumference is linked to increased risk of various health conditions, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes. To measure your waist, follow these steps: 1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and locate the area around your natural waist, which is the smallest point between your rib cage and belly button. 2. Wrap the measuring tape around your waist, ensuring it is parallel to the ground and snug, but not tight or distorting your skin. 3. Take a deep breath and exhale, then record the measurement in inches or centimeters. Step 3: Measure your hips Hip circumference is an essential measurement to understand your overall body shape and fat distribution. To measure your hips, follow these steps: 1. Stand with your feet together and locate the widest part of your hips, often around the gluteal muscles. 2. Wrap the measuring tape around your hips, ensuring it is parallel to the ground and snug against your skin without being too tight. 3. Record the measurement in inches or centimeters. Step 4: Measure your height Accurate height measurement is essential for inputting data into various body composition algorithms. To measure your height, follow these steps: 1. Stand barefoot and straight against a flat wall with your heels, buttocks, and shoulders touching the wall, and your head facing forward. 2. Have a helper use a straight object, such as a book, to make a horizontal mark level with the top of your head. 3. Measure the distance from the floor to the mark in inches or centimeters. Step 5: Enter your recorded data into the correct equation Now that you have collected all the essential body measurements, input them into an appropriate equation to assess your health. Some useful equations include calculating your Body Mass Index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, or waist-to-height ratio. These equations are crucial tools to determine your overall health risk, body composition, and fitness level. Step 6: Interpret your results After inputting your measurements into the chosen equation, interpret the results to understand your health status and areas that need improvement. Keep in mind that these figures are just a part of the puzzle of understanding your overall health, and should be taken into consideration alongside other aspects such as exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle. Conclusion Knowing your body's dimensions is vital for understanding your health and making informed decisions about your wellness journey. Following this guide will allow you to measure your body accurately, input the data into the correct equation, and interpret the results to make positive changes in your life. Remember that understanding your body composition is a vital tool in maintaining good health and promoting a balanced lifestyle. So, grab a measuring tape, and get started on your path to better health!"},{"prompt":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Hebrew. Your job is to translate the Hebrew sentence into Portugese.

Context: The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America\\" and in his diary recorded: \\"Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine\\". The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\\".

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

The researchers set out to examine the connection between social media use and sleep among young adults. Levenson, who led the study, noticed that these young adults are possibly the first \\"generation to grow up with social media.\\" The researchers wanted to find out how often young people used social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Histogram, etc. For the study, they gave questionnaires to nearly 1,800 adults, aged 19 to 32. On average, members of the study group used social media sites one hour a day. They also \\"visited various social media accounts 30 times per week.\\" Thirty percent of the study's participants reported having serious problems with sleeping. Those people who used social media a lot were three times more likely to have a sleep disorder.

As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia. But I can use this background: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. What is an answer for this question: Which friend had an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH)? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Danny had an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The given background information states that excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, which can be more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), excessive intake of vitamin D, or bone destruction. In this scenario, Danny is the friend who has been diagnosed with hypercalcaemia. Therefore, it can be inferred that it is Danny who had an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). On the other hand, Greg had hypocalcaemia, which is associated with inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes or issues related to inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or defective PTH receptors in cells.

Take your macaw to an avian veterinarian for a complete physical checkup. Get blood tests done and test for hypothyroidism, psittacine beak and feather disease.","completion":"After you have completed the physical examination of your macaw and have consulted with an avian veterinarian, the most logical next event would depend on the results. If a medical issue was identified as the cause for the feather picking or chewing, then you should address the underlying medical issue with the appropriate treatment prescribed by your veterinarian. However, if no medical issue is identified, then the following steps can be taken to help prevent further feather picking or chewing: 1. Environmental Enrichment: Feather picking can be a sign of boredom or stress in a macaw. Providing a variety of toys, perches, and activities in their cage can keep them mentally stimulated and engaged. Rotate and change the toys periodically to prevent boredom. Consider puzzle toys and foraging opportunities that stimulate their natural instincts. 2. Social Interaction: Macaws are social creatures and require regular human interaction or companionship from other birds. Spend more time with your macaw and engage them in play, training, or conversation, depending on their preferences. Positive reinforcement through rewards and praise when they refrain from feather picking can help in reducing the behavior. 3. Balanced Diet: A nutritious diet plays a vital role in their overall health and can affect their feather condition. Provide a balanced diet of pellets, fresh fruits, vegetables, and occasional seeds and nuts. Consult your veterinarian for specific dietary recommendations for your macaw. 4. Proper Grooming: Maintain a regular grooming routine to keep your macaw's skin and feathers in good condition. This includes periodic misting or allowing your macaw to bathe, as well as trimming their nails and beak as needed. Encourage preening by supplying them with preening materials like natural fiber ropes. 5. Stress Reduction: Identify and eliminate any stress factors that could be contributing to their feather picking behavior. This may include loud noises, sudden changes in their environment, inadequate lighting, or a lack of privacy. Establish a consistent daily routine and provide a comfortable and consistent environment for them to help reduce stress. 6. Anti-Feather Picking Sprays: If necessary, use anti-feather picking sprays or ointments that can discourage the behavior by making the feathers less appealing to the macaw. Make sure to use products specifically designed for birds, and follow the instructions carefully. When in doubt, consult your veterinarian for recommendations on suitable products. 7. Behavioral Consultation: If the feather picking or chewing continues despite your intervention, consult an avian behavior specialist. They can provide behavioral modification training and guidance on how to manage the issue. This might involve adjusting your interaction with the bird, addressing separation anxiety, or using positive reinforcement to redirect the behavior to healthier alternatives. Remember that stopping a macaw from feather picking or chewing can be a time-consuming process that requires patience and consistency. Monitor your macaw closely and communicate regularly with your veterinarian to ensure their physical and emotional well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France's position in the world, and, second, changes in French society. Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would \\"restore national pride, threatened\\", he believed, by \\"The gradual softening of social mores\\" in the middle classes. Their taste for \\"material pleasures\\" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it \\"an example of weakness and egotism\\". Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud, Tocqueville went so far to claim that \\"war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science.\\" Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations, one for European colonists and one for the Arab population. Such a two-tier arrangement would be fully realised with the 1870 Cremieux decree and the Indigenousness Code, which extended French citizenship to European settlers and Algerian Jews, whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed by Muslim law and restricted to a second-class citizenship.

Vasco da Gama was born in 1460 or 1469 in Sines, on the southwest coast of Portugal, probably in a house near the church of Nossa Senhora das Salas. Sines, one of the few seaports on the Alentejo coast, consisted of little more than a cluster of whitewashed, red-tiled cottages, occupied chiefly by fisherfolk. Vasco da Gama's father was Estevao da Gama, who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu. He rose in the ranks of the military Order of Santiago. In December 1499, King Manuel I of Portugal rewarded Vasco da Gama with the town of Sines as a hereditary fief (the town his father, Estevao, had once held as a commenda). This turned out to be a complicated affair, for Sines still belonged to the Order of Santiago. The master of the Order, Jorge de Lencastre, might have endorsed the reward - after all, da Gama was a Santiago knight, one of their own, and a close associate of Lencastre himself. But the fact that Sines was awarded by the king provoked Lencastre to refuse out of principle, lest it encourage the king to make other donations of the Order's properties. Da Gama would spend the next few years attempting to take hold of Sines, an effort that would estrange him from Lencastre and eventually prompt da Gama to abandon his beloved Order of Santiago, switching over to the rival Order of Christ in 1507. In the meantime, da Gama made do with a substantial hereditary royal pension of 300,000 reis. He was awarded the noble title of Dom (lord) in perpetuity for himself, his siblings and their descendants. On 30 January 1502, da Gama was awarded the title of Almirante dos mares de Arabia, Persia, India e de todo o Oriente (\\"Admiral of the Seas of Arabia, Persia, India and all the Orient\\") - an overwrought title reminiscent of the ornate Castilian title borne by Christopher Columbus (evidently, Manuel must have reckoned that if Castile had an 'Admiral of the Ocean Seas', then surely Portugal should have one too). Another royal letter, dated October 1501, gave da Gama the personal right to intervene and exercise a determining role on any future India-bound fleet. Around 1501, Vasco da Gama married Catarina de Ataide, daughter of Alvaro de Ataide, the alcaide-mor of Alvor (Algarve), and a prominent nobleman connected by kinship with the powerful Almeida family (Catarina was a first cousin of D. Francisco de Almeida).Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What is the origin of this title?","completion":"To provide the quote for answering the question \\"What is the origin of this title?\\" in reference to the title \\"Almirante dos mares de Arabia, Persia, India e de todo o Oriente\\": \\"On 30 January 1502, da Gama was awarded the title of Almirante dos mares de Arabia, Persia, India e de todo o Oriente (\\"Admiral of the Seas of Arabia, Persia, India and all the Orient\\") - an overwrought title reminiscent of the ornate Castilian title borne by Christopher Columbus (evidently, Manuel must have reckoned that if Castile had an 'Admiral of the Ocean Seas', then surely Portugal should have one too).\\""},{"prompt":"Bachelor of Integrated Studies - Bachelor of Integrated Studies (BIS) is an interdisciplinary bachelor's degree offered by several universities in the United States and Canada.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Elizabeth Berridge is on the walk of fame","completion":"No, we cannot draw the conclusion that Elizabeth Berridge is on the Walk of Fame based only on the information provided. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a notable landmark in Hollywood, California that honours individuals in the entertainment industry for their contributions in the categories of Motion Pictures, Television, Recording, Radio and Live Performance/Theatre. Although Berridge has had a long and successful career in film, television, and theatre, a star on the Walk of Fame is not automatically granted to all involved in these sectors; it requires a specific nomination and selection process. The process of getting a star on the Walk of Fame includes being nominated by anyone who can pay the submission fee, the nominee's agreement to attend the award ceremony if selected, and the payment of a sizable fee for the creation and maintenance of the star. Therefore, a star is not solely an acknowledgement of talent or success, but also involves extraneous factors including willingness to participate in the process, and financial backing.

The gorilla is the largest of the apes. He is as tall as six feet when standing upright. Many people think that gorillas are very fierce. They are often described as standing upright like a man, beating their fists and roaring. In their home, in the forests of Central Africa, however, they are not at all like this, They are peaceful animals and never use their great strength unless attacked. Even then, they retreat if they can. Gorillas have black faces and long, black, hairy coats. They feed during the day on plants and fruit. At night the old male often sleeps on the ground at the foot of a tree, while the others each make a sleeping platform in the tree bending the leafy branches. Besides this, gorillas climb trees very seldom. Question: Apes live in _ .

It uses tiny blades housed in the 'leaves' that turn in the wind - regardless of its direction - and has the added advantage of being completely silent. Scroll down for video. Green energy: A French start-up has developed a 'Wind Tree' that generates power from air currents. Innovative: It uses tiny blades housed in the 'leaves' that turn in the wind - regardless of its direction. After three years of research, the team of engineers developed a 26ft prototype, which is now installed in the Pleumeur-Bodou commune in Brittany in northwestern France. He hopes they can eventually be used in people's own homes and in urban centres. The tree, which will sell for £23,500, can reportedly generate electricity on twice the number of days as a conventional wind turbine because it can generate power on winds of just 4.5mph. Mr Michaud-Lariviere said the tree - which has not yet been tested by an independent laboratory - is profitable after winds of 7.8mph on average over one year. 'The idea came to me in a square where I saw the leaves tremble when there was not a breath of air,' said Jérôme Michaud-Larivière, the founder of the Parisian start-up which will market the Wind Tree in 2015.

He admits there are more consistent winds 160ft in the air but they require 'monstrous machines', far from where energy is consumed, he added. He hopes the tree can be combined with other means of power generation such as photovoltaic, and geothermal, combined with energy-efficient buildings. In the future Mr Michaud-Larivière hopes to develop a 'perfect tree that has leaves with natural fibres, roots that could generate geothermal energy and 'bark' covered with photosensitive cells.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student learned more about animals that live in social groups? The answer is:","completion":"Manny learned more about animals that live in social groups. This is because he studied animal communication, which is a vital aspect of social behavior among animals. Animals that live in social groups rely on various forms of communication to interact with each other. These forms of communication can include vocalizations, body language, chemical signals, and even bioluminescence in some cases. Studying animal communication enables Manny to gain a deeper understanding of how animals that live in social groups coordinate their actions, share information about their environment, establish and maintain relationships, and navigate the complex social hierarchies within their communities. For instance, he may have learned about the intricate communication systems of bees, ants, and termites, which are essential for coordinating the activities of their large colonies. Similarly, he could have studied the sophisticated vocalizations of dolphins and whales, which facilitate their social interactions and cooperative efforts when hunting and navigating their aquatic environments. Dean, on the other hand, focused on animal feeding patterns and nutrition, which are critical to understanding the energy and nutrient needs of animals in various habitats. However, this aspect of their behavior does not necessarily provide insights into the social dynamics of animals or the differences between animals that live in social groups and those that lead solitary lives.

I would not recommend THE GOTH ANTHOLOGY!!! Answer: Answer:","completion":"The given product review does not seem to be a positive one. Here is a brief analysis of the review to help you understand why it is negative: 1. Title: \\"Very Disappointing!!!\\" - Right off the bat, the title of the review conveys dissatisfaction and disappointment with the product in question, which in this case is THE GOTH ANTHOLOGY. 2. Review Content: The reviewer goes on to provide specific reasons for their dissatisfaction with the product. They mention that they only received the 3rd disk, implying that they were expecting more than one disk. This could be seen as an issue with the product's packaging or delivery, leading to an incomplete collection, which further adds to the negative feeling. 3. The reviewer also states that the 3rd disk \\"pretty much sucks,\\" indicating that they did not enjoy the music and found it to be of poor quality or not to their taste. This adds to the negative sentiment of the review. 4. The reviewer mentions liking one song, \\"Pretty in Pink,\\" but only when performed by another band, The Grown-Ups. This further emphasizes that the content provided in the product - in this case, the song as performed by the original artist - was not up to their expectations or standards. 5. The reviewer then stresses that this product is \\"NOT goth,\\" suggesting that the content of the anthology does not align with the expectations set by the title or description of the product. This misrepresentation of the genre may be seen as another negative aspect of the product. 6. Finally, the reviewer ends the review by stating that they \\"would not recommend THE GOTH ANTHOLOGY.\\" This definitive statement serves as a summary of their overall negative experience and dissuades potential buyers from considering this product. In conclusion, the product review is undoubtedly negative, as it expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with both the content and packaging of the product, as well as the misrepresentation of the genre. The reviewer's unenthusiastic opinion of the specific songs mentioned and their decision not to recommend the product further contribute to the negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: \\"I am happy to be here to see you.\\" The hypothesis conveys a similar sentiment as the premise; however, it goes beyond the act of seeing everyone and delves into the speaker's emotion, which is being happy to be there specifically to see those they are addressing. It also emphasizes the importance of their presence, suggesting that the speaker has a deeper level of connection with those gathered. Options: 1. Yes 2. It is not possible to tell 3.

While both the premise and hypothesis convey the idea that the speaker is experiencing positive emotions when seeing everyone present, the hypothesis adds a level of complexity that isn't covered by the premise alone (the happiness of being there to see them, and the importance of their presence). In other words, it is possible for the speaker to feel nice while seeing everyone again without necessarily being happy to be there or feeling a deeper importance in their presence.

Article: The moral considerations associated with doping are as complicated as the lexical challenges of the term itself. What “doping” is, precisely, and under what conditions it should be allowed are questions the sports world may never totally resolve. Caffeine is a drug that enhances performance, but it’s OK. Amphetamine is also a drug that enhances performance, but it is not. It’s all a matter of where you draw the line. So if competitive cyclists want to gain an advantage by ingesting someone else’s poop, I say we all just go ahead and let them, for crying out loud. You think I am joking, but it’s right here in this Denver Post link, the URL of which ends with “poop-doping-cycling,” and the content of which concerns a powerful microbiome. The most important, perhaps, is Prevotella. Not typically found in American and European gut microbiomes, Prevotella is thought to play a role in enhancing muscle recovery. “In my sampling, only half of cyclists have Prevotella, but top racers always have it,” she told Bicycling. “It’s not even in 10 percent of non-athletes.” Peterson reports she hosts Prevotella in her own gut – but not naturally. In fact, she might be the first case of “poop doping,” thanks to a fecal transplant she administered herself three years ago. Her donor? Another elite athlete. That’s Lauren Peterson, a microbiologist and pro endurance mountain biker, who self-administered her first poop transplant from another elite athlete three years ago. She said she did it both to improve her athletic performance and to treat symptoms from the Lyme disease she contracted as a child. Fecal transplants are rare for reasons I assume are obvious, and some reasons that are not. In the U.S., they’re pretty much only done to treat extreme cases of a specific disease, Clostridium difficile, which causes chronic diarrhea. Peterson couldn’t find a doctor willing to do a poop transplant on her, so she did it herself. Sign up Like this article?

Something went wrong. Try again? “I just did it at home,” she said of the February 2014 procedure. “It’s not fun, but it’s pretty basic.” Of course, you know what happens next. It was a miracle cure, her energy went through the roof, she started winning races. “I had more energy than I knew what to do with,” she told the same podcast last year. “Like everything just changed.” All because of somebody else’s poop. Whatever is to become of “poop doping,” these are the early stages of it. Peterson is pretty sure it’s going to catch on in cycling, and given everything we’ve learned about cycling culture over the last, oh … let’s just say the whole modern history of the sport, this seems like a good bet. Peterson imagined a day when you could accomplish the same thing just by taking a pill. That would certainly be called a Prevotella pill, but we’d all know it by its street name: The Poop Pill. And if that’s what cyclists really want to do, I say go ahead. I’m not going to talk you out of eating poop. That’s what your parents are for. ||||| RELATED: Gut Science is the Future of Hydration “I couldn’t find a doctor who could help me,” remembers Petersen. An interest in finding her own solutions had already propelled her towards a career in science, and while she was in grad school she had her gut sequenced by the American Gut Project*. The results showed that her gut microbiome is 96% gram-negative bacteria. While American Gut is purely a research project and results cannot be used as a diagnostic or to inform treatment, Petersen worried that some of these bacteria might be pathogenic, and could get into her blood stream. “I had no microbes to help me break down food, and I had picked up bugs in the lab where I was working because my system was so weak and susceptible.” But a few months after her transplant, Petersen was training five days a week (up from her usual two). She started enduro racing, and was soon placing and even winning in the pro field. “I wondered if I had gotten my microbiome from a couch potato, not a racer, if I would I be doing so well,” remembers Petersen. \\"Then it made me wonder what the best possible microbiome for a racer would be.” RELATED: How use of Probiotics Benefits Cyclists So, she started gathering stool samples from amateur and professional bike racers. She observed that Prevotella, a microorganism she received in her own transplant, is common amongst elite racers. “The more a person trains, the more likely they are to have Prevotella,” says Petersen. “In my sampling, only half of cyclists have Prevotella, but top racers always have it... it’s not even in 10% of non-athletes.” She is currently extracting Prevotella to understand what it is, and how to boost its abundance naturally or through a probiotic pill for athletes or aspiring athletes. What she already knows: Prevotella synthesize branch chain amino acids critical for muscle recovery. RELATED: How to Change Your Gut Bacteria to Lose Weight In addition to Prevotella, Petersen has identified an archeon named Methanobrevibacter smithii, or M. smithii, which she believes is also significant. Archeon are ancient microorganisms that have managed to survive for millions of years in hostile habitats like sulfur springs and deep in the ocean. They also live in the human digestive system, where they have specialized functions. Like Prevotella, Elite cyclists often have M. smithii, but it’s less common in amateur racers. That’s significant because M. smithii also appears to be a performance-enhancing microbe. What does it do? In science terms, it thrives on hydrogen and carbon dioxide and other bacterial waste products in the gut. In 12-year old boy terms, M. smithii eats the poop of bacteria. Yes, everybody poops, even bacteria, and it can have detrimental effects on your health. Namely: buildups of hydrogen and carbon dioxide can prevent the other bacteria in your gut from properly breaking down your food for fuel, which is bad news if you need calories for that sprint. So in 12-year-old boy terms, M. smithii is kind of like a bacterial pooper scooper. In science terms, it helps you turn the food you’re eating into energy more efficiently. For example, it boosts the ability of your gut bacteria to break down fiber from fruit into the short-chain fatty acids that are critical fuel for athletes. Petersen is still investigating how different foods can impact Prevotella, M. smithii, and the rest of the 120 species and 350 strains of microbes she’s identified in bike racers' guts. And she doesn’t know if those microorganisms need other ingredients to work. She also doesn’t know if Prevotella and M. smithii are differentiators for cyclists only, or also common in elite basketball players or gymnasts. So unfortunately it could be years, not months, before you’ll be able to buy performance-enhancing probiotics. (In the mean time, you can try top-rated Ultimate Flora for 29 on Amazon.) As for actual poop doping…. fecal transplants are available, but not in the U.S. And if you do find a clinic willing to do it, Petersen warns that \\"you can’t choose your donor, and it’s a risky procedure. As with any transplant, your immune system could reject what you get. It’s not something you should take lightly. I did a lot of research, and I took a risk for sure.” To be clear, Petersen in no way supports 'at home' fecal transplants— she simply thinks there's room to improve our probiotic and prebiotic knowledge. RELATED: Pro Cyclist Habits to Follow— or Ignore With the data collected from the Athlete Microbiome Project, Petersen is diving into research not just on performance enhancing probiotics for cyclists, but whether cyclist-derived gut microorganisms could boost the health of athletes and non-athletes alike, providing greater long-term benefits than the probiotics currently available. “What we’re learning is going to change a lot for cyclists as well as the rest of the population,” says Petersen. “If you get tested and you’re missing something, maybe in three years you’ll be able to get it through a pill instead of a fecal transplant. We’ve got data that no one has ever seen before, and we’re learning a lot. And I think I can say with confidence that bacterial doping— call it poop doping, if you must— is coming soon.” Want to get involved? If you’re a Pro or Cat 1 cyclist and want to share what’s in your gut, contact Lauren. *The American Gut Project does not provide information that should be used for clinical decisions. |||||Summary:","completion":"The use of fecal microbiota transplants, or \\"poop doping\\", among cyclists could become widespread as researchers work to understand and replicate the benefits of key microbes.

Your job is to choose whether the two sentences clearly agree (entailment)/disagree (contradiction) with each other, or if this cannot be determined (neutral). Your answer must be in the form of the numbers 0 (entailment), 1 (neutral), or 2(contradiction). sentence_A: There is no man singing and playing the guitar. sentence_B: The man is singing and playing the guitar Output:","completion":"In this task, we are given two sentences (sentence A and sentence B) and need to determine if they agree (entailment), disagree (contradiction), or cannot determine the relationship (neutral). The output should be a number representing each case: 0 for entailment, 1 for neutral, and 2 for contradiction. Now let's analyze the given sentences: sentence_A: There is no man singing and playing the guitar. sentence_B: The man is singing and playing the guitar. These two sentences have opposite meanings. Sentence A says there is no man doing a certain action, while sentence B confirms that there is a man doing that action. So, they clearly disagree with each other, which means the relationship between them is a contradiction. Following the provided guidelines: Entailment = 0 Neutral = 1 Contradiction = 2 Since the sentences have a contradiction relationship, the output will be: Output: 2"},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

You should remove all of the integers that are divisible by 3 from the list. If every integer in the input list is divisible by 3 then an empty list should be returned. Zero is divisible by 3. Q: [3, -3] A:","completion":"In this task: 1. You have a list of integers (for example, [3, -3]). 2. Your goal is to remove all integers in the list that are divisible by 3. 3. Zero is also considered divisible by 3. Guidelines: 1. Go through each integer in the given list ([3, -3] in this case). 2. Check if the integer is divisible by 3 (meaning it can be divided by 3 without leaving a remainder). For example, 3 is divisible by 3 as 3/3 = 1, but 4 is not divisible by 3 as 4/3 = 1.333 (with a remainder). 3. If the integer is divisible by 3, remove it from the list. 4. Continue this process until you have checked all the integers in the list. 5. If all integers are divisible by 3 (like in this example), return an empty list. To find the answer for the example given (Q: [3, -3]; A:): 1. Check the first integer, 3. It is divisible by 3, so remove it from the list. The list now becomes []. 2. Check the next integer, -3. It is also divisible by 3, so remove it from the list. The list is still []. 3. No more integers left to check. Since all integers were divisible by 3, our final answer is the empty list: [] Thus, the answer is A: []."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Before embarking on an explaining menstruation, make a conscious effort to keep things neutral or positive. It’s important that both boys and girls see menstruation as a normal and healthy process, not something that people should be embarrassed about or feel guilt or shame from. Avoid derogatory language that makes menstruation sound negative, dirty, or unpleasant. Boys may think that the bleeding may be painful, like from a cut. Assure them that the bleeding does not hurt and is not painful. You can explain that some women experience cramps, which are muscle cramps in the body, but the pain does not come from bleeding. When talking about menstruation, communicate that menstruation is a healthy and normal part of growing up for girls. Just like boys develop facial hair and their voices change, girls start to physically change, too. Say, “Before her blood comes for the first time, a girl does not have access to her power to create a baby. When it does come, it signals her that her body is ready to have a baby. It’s exciting to have this ability. Now, whether she is ready for a baby is something else!” For young children, you can talk about how the body cleans itself. Say, “Girls’ bodies are different than boys’ bodies. A major part of the body is cleaning from the inside out, like when you go pee or poo, or when you blow your nose. When girls get older, their body starts cleaning in a new way. Sometimes girls use special things to help their bodies be clean.” Girls have different body parts than boys. You may want to define terms like “uterus,” “vagina,” or “pregnancy.” Say, “These are all body parts that girls have that boys do not have. Uterus is a big word that means where a baby grows. Vagina is a word that tells us where babies leave the body, or where blood leaves if there is no baby. Pregnancy is what happens when a baby is growing inside a woman.” You can say, “Women and girls have different body parts than boys. This is because women can grow babies in their bodies and men cannot. These are the things that women have that men don’t.” With older boys, you may want to introduce common terminology related to women’s cycles. Clearly explain any newly introduced terminology. Some things you may want to explain include the words “period,” “menstruation,” or “cycle.” You may also want to include slang terms, like “time of the month,” “Aunt Flo,” or “moon/moon cycle,” as these terms may come up at school or within the boy’s social network. Keep your answers simple. If explaining the word period, say, “A period is something at the end of a sentence. But it can also mean the time each month when a woman’s body cleans itself from the inside out. It’s a word that sums up a process that happens in a woman’s body.” Clearly communicate that there is nothing “wrong” with menstruation blood. It is not embarrassing, gross, or shameful. It doesn’t make a girl “dirty.” If your boys know that a girl is menstruating, tell them to treat her with respect and not to tease her or make her feel bad. Say, “If you notice a girl has her period or has blood on her clothes, it’s important to treat her with respect. It’s not okay to tease her or make fun of her. Don’t say anything hurtful to her or anyone else. Remember that it’s normal to have a period.” Make sure they know that menstruation is totally normal and healthy.","completion":"Educate both boys and girls about menstruation as a normal and healthy process, using neutral and positive language, while introducing appropriate terminology and emphasizing the importance of treating each other with respect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While on a tour of works at Cardiff, he caught a chill and returned to London, half-paralysed, where he lay dying for some three weeks. Among his last visitors were Oscar Wilde and James Whistler. He was buried in the tomb he designed for his mother at West Norwood, London. On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote \\"a constant relationship ... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe. Thank God his work will live and ... be the admiration of future students. I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet. He was almost all the world to me.\\" Lady Bute, wife of his greatest patron, wrote, \\"Dear Burges, ugly Burges, who designed such lovely things – what a duck.\\" In Saint Fin Barre's, together with memorials to his mother and sister, there is a memorial plaque to Burges, designed by him, and erected by his father. It shows the King of Heaven presiding over the four apostles, who hold open the Word of God. Under the inscription \\"Architect of this cathedral\\" is a simple shield and a small, worn, plaque with a mosaic surround, bearing Burges's entwined initials and name.

Information: - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Krisiun is a Brazilian death metal band, founded by brothers Alex Camargo (bass, vocals), Moyses Kolesne (guitars) and Max Kolesne (drums).

A large rectangular metal pan appears with instructions that say to fill it with a pan of hot water. the circular cake pan","completion":"The circular cake pan, with its smooth and sleek design, is carefully placed into the rectangular metal pan. The purpose of this arrangement is to create a water bath, also known as a bain-marie, which provides gentle and consistent heat for delicate recipes like cheesecake, custard, or even some types of mousse. The water in the larger pan transfers heat slowly and evenly to the contents of the smaller pan, ensuring that the dessert cooks through without curdling or developing a tough texture. As you examine the pans, you notice that the rectangular pan is sturdy, with high sides that will safely hold the hot water necessary for this technique. It is crucial to use a pan that will not warp or buckle under the heat and weight of the water, as it could lead to uneven cooking or potential spills in the oven. On the other hand, the circular cake pan, designed specifically for your dessert, is slightly smaller in size, so it can comfortably fit within the larger pan. The instructions specify that you should fill the rectangular pan with hot water, so you carefully pour water from a recently boiled kettle into the pan until it reaches approximately halfway up the sides of the circular cake pan. It is important not to overfill the pan, as the water could overflow and potentially cause injury or damage when moving the pans in and out of the oven. Once the water bath is set up, you'll want to ensure steady heat from the oven itself. Preheat the oven to the temperature specified in your recipe, allowing enough time for the heat to equalize before placing your dessert inside. As you slide the water bath onto the middle rack, it's essential to use caution and move smoothly to prevent any splashing or spills. Throughout the baking process, you'll need to keep a close eye on the water level, as some of it may evaporate during cooking. You may need to occasionally replenish the hot water to maintain the right depth. Properly maintaining the water bath will help you achieve the desired consistency, texture, and appearance for your dessert. Once your dessert has finished cooking, use oven mitts to carefully remove the pans from the oven, again being cautious not to let the hot water splash. Let the circular cake pan sit in the water bath until it cools down to room temperature to prevent sudden temperature changes that could lead to cracks or other imperfections. After cooling, you'll likely want to refrigerate your dessert for a few hours or until it sets completely, depending on your recipe. In conclusion, the art of using a water bath, or bain-marie, is essential when preparing delicate and sensitive desserts. By following the instructions provided, taking proper precautions, and being attentive throughout the cooking process, you'll be sure to create a delectable and visually appealing treat for everyone to enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman. Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band's debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen. In January 2009, M. Shadows confirmed that the band was writing the follow-up to their self-titled fourth album within the upcoming months. They also played at Rock on the Range, from May 16-17, 2009. On April 16, they performed a version of Guns N' Roses' \\"It's So Easy\\" onstage with Slash, at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles. On December 28, 2009, the band's drummer James \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan was found dead at his home at the age of 28. Autopsy results were inconclusive, but on June 9, 2010, the cause of death was revealed to have been an \\"acute polydrug intoxication due to combined effects of Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Diazepam/Nordiazepam and ethanol\\". In a statement by the band, they expressed their grief over the death of The Rev and later posted a message from Sullivan's family which expressed their gratitude to his fans for their support. The band members admitted in a number of interviews that they considered disbanding at this point in time. However, on February 17, 2010, Avenged Sevenfold stated that they had entered the studio, along with now-former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, to drum for the album, in place of The Rev. The single \\"Nightmare\\" was digitally released on May 18, 2010. A preview for the song was released on May 6, 2010 on Amazon.com, but was removed soon after for unknown reasons. Mixing for the album had been completed in New York City, and Nightmare was finally released worldwide on July 27, 2010. It met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics but was well received by the fans. Nightmare beat sales projections easily, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of 163,000 units in its first week. After finishing recording, in December, Portnoy and the band posted simultaneous statements on their websites stating that he would not be their replacement for The Rev. However, Portnoy did travel with the band overseas in December 2010 for three shows in Iraq and Kuwait sponsored by the USO. They played for U.S. Soldiers at Camp Adder, Camp Beuhring, and Balad Air Base. On January 20, 2011, Avenged Sevenfold announced via Facebook that former Confide drummer Arin Ilejay would begin touring with them that year. He was not yet considered a full-time member at this point. Avenged Sevenfold performed at the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festivals on June 3-5, 2011 alongside other bands such as Alter Bridge, System of a Down, and In Flames. On April 2011, the band headlined the Golden God Awards held by Metal Hammer. The same night the band won three awards for \\"Best Vocalist\\" (M. Shadows), \\"Epiphone Best Guitarist(s)\\" (Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance) and \\"Affliction's Album of The Year: \\" for Nightmare, while Mike Portnoy won the award for \\"Drum Workshop's Best Drummer\\" for his work on the album. Avenged Sevenfold headlined the 2011 Uproar Festival with supporting acts Three Days Grace, Seether, Bullet for My Valentine, Escape The Fate, among others. In November and December 2011, the band went on their \\"Buried Alive\\" tour with supporting acts Hollywood Undead, Asking Alexandria, and Black Veil Brides.

Tell me who him is.","completion":"In the sentence \\"James cheated off Henry's test, and the Teacher failed him,\\" the pronoun \\"him\\" most likely refers to James. The context given in the sentence provides important information: James cheated off Henry's test. Cheating is a violation of academic integrity and is generally punished when discovered. Thus, when the sentence continues with \\"the Teacher failed him,\\" it is logical to assume that the Teacher failed the person who was caught cheating - which, in this case, is James. Moreover, the structure of the sentence supports this interpretation as well. The two pieces of information are connected by the coordinating conjunction \\"and,\\" suggesting that the second clause (“the Teacher failed him”) is related to the first clause (James cheated off Henry’s test). Since cheating is a punishable offense, it makes sense that the person caught cheating (James) would be the one to suffer the consequences. In conclusion, in the given sentence, \\"him\\" refers to James, as he is the one who cheated off Henry's test and was subsequently punished with a failing grade by the Teacher."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

After sitting out yesterday #39;s morning skate, Canada #39;s top goalie chose to bow out of last night #39;s World Cup of Hockey semi-final victory over the Czech Republic because of his left wrist injury.","completion":"Title: Martin Brodeur's Absence in the World Cup Hockey Semi-final Due to Wrist Injury Introduction: The World Cup of Hockey is one of the most prestigious international competitions in the sport of ice hockey. Featuring the best players from around the globe, teams compete for the coveted trophy, showcasing their skill, teamwork, and national pride. In 2004, the participants in the semi-final match between Canada and the Czech Republic were in for an exciting and memorable game. However, the absence of one of the key players from the Canadian team, Martin Brodeur, due to a wrist injury, was a significant talking point before the match. Background on Martin Brodeur: Martin Brodeur is widely considered one of the greatest goaltenders in the history of ice hockey. Born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Brodeur has an impressive career spanning over two decades. Known for his ability to read the game and his unique puck handling skills, he has become a vital part of any roster he has been a part of. A three-time Stanley Cup Champion with the New Jersey Devils and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, Brodeur has solidified his position as one of the greatest to ever dress for team Canada. Wrist Injury and Impact on the Team: Brodeur sat out during the team's morning skate session leading up to the semi-final game against the Czech Republic due to discomfort in his left wrist. After consultation with the team's medical staff, it was determined that he would not be able to perform at his best in the crucial match. As a result, Brodeur made the difficult decision to sit out of the game. His absence was a significant loss for the Canadian team as he was their starting goaltender and had been performing exceptionally well during the tournament. Additionally, it added pressure onto the shoulders of the backup goaltender, Roberto Luongo, who needed to step up and take the place of a hockey legend in a critical game with high stakes. Brodeur's Team-first Mentality: Despite the immense disappointment he must have felt from missing out on a pivotal game, Brodeur's decision to prioritize the team's best interests over his own is a testament to his character and commitment to the sport. By acknowledging his physical limitations and stepping aside for a healthier teammate, Brodeur displayed true sportsmanship and team-first mentality. His decision was celebrated as a selfless act that allowed the Canadian team the best chance of victory in a vital match. Conclusion: In the end, the Canadian team managed to secure a victory against the Czech Republic in the World Cup of Hockey semi-final. Brodeur's decision to prioritize his team over personal glory serves as a valuable lesson for athletes and sports fans alike. It teaches the importance of selflessness, teamwork, and the ability to make difficult decisions for the greater good of one's team. While his wrist injury forced him to sit out, Martin Brodeur's legacy as one of the greatest goaltenders in ice hockey history remains intact. His selflessness and willingness to put the team's success above his own serve as an inspiration not only to his teammates but also to future generations of hockey players world over."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who has devised and elaborate scheme against Lufton with Pindalest? Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men.

In which novel of 1869 does Pierre Bezuhov fight a duel in which both participants survive?","completion":"The novel you are referring to is \\"War and Peace\\" (1869) by Russian author, Leo Tolstoy. This monumental work of literature is set in the period surrounding the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society. The duel scene that you mention takes place in the first volume of the novel between the characters Pierre Bezukhov and Dolokhov. Pierre Bezukhov is one of the novel's leading characters and is a wealthy and sincere man, although sometimes gullible and prone to rash decisions. He is often torn between his intellectual and moralistic ideals and the temptations that confront him within high society. On the other side, Dolokhov is an amoral character, known for his cunning, ruthlessness, and skilled manipulation. He is particularly talented in the art of dueling and has won many duels without being defeated. The conflict between Pierre and Dolokhov begins when Pierre discovers that his wife, Helene, is rumored to be having an affair with Dolokhov. Pierre is devastated and feels a mixture of betrayal, humiliation, and anger. Unable to contain his emotions, Pierre confronts Dolokhov and challenges him to a duel. Dolokhov, known for his expertise in combat and extensive experience in duels, accepts the challenge without hesitation. The duel takes place early in the morning in a snowy woodland at the remote outskirts of the city, with only a few individuals present as witnesses. Pierre, who has never fought a duel before, is obviously nervous and unprepared. Despite this inexperience, Pierre manages to shoot and wound Dolokhov, while Dolokhov's shot misses Pierre. Pierre is both surprised and horrified by his actions, and the experience serves as a turning point for his character in the novel. Both participants survive this tense encounter, although it leaves a lasting impact on their lives. Recently disillusioned by the intrigues and corruption of Russian high society, Pierre undergoes a major spiritual and personal transformation by the end of the novel. Dolokhov, on the other hand, resumes his manipulative ways and becomes involved in more trouble elsewhere in the course of the narrative. Overall, the duel between Pierre Bezukhov and Dolokhov in \\"War and Peace\\" serves as a pivotal scene for the development of the characters and provides a broader commentary on the morality and challenges faced by the individuals in this tumultuous period of Russian history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

În 2003, entitatea numită ESI a stârnit numeroase controverse prin faptul că a cerut ca puterile extensive ale lui Ashdown de a destitui oficiali și de a impune legi să fie abolite. Această solicitare a fost privită cu scepticism și critici de către o parte a societății, întrucât ar fi dus la o schimbare semnificativă în funcționarea autorităților și în modul în care erau aplicate legile. Mai mult, această solicitare a fost interpretată de mulți drept un atac direct la adresa autorității lui Ashdown și a puterii pe care aceasta o exercita în țară. Acest moment dificil în politica țării a dus la discuții aprinse și dezbateri între susținătorii și detractorii ideii propuse de ESI. Unii considerau că puterile pe care le avea Ashdown erau absolut necesare pentru a menține ordinea și stabilitatea, în timp ce alții credeau că acestea reprezentau o amenințare la adresa democrației și a drepturilor cetățenilor. Pe parcursul anului 2003, dezbaterile au continuat să încalcească sentimentele oamenilor și să provoace diviziuni în sânul societății, determinând liderii politici și oficialii guvernamentali să ia poziție și să facă declarații în legătură cu subiectul. Deși numeroase voci influente au apreciat curajul ESI de a aduce în discuție această problemă în public, alții au considerat că organizația a fost iresponsabilă și că a încercat să destabilizeze guvernul și să provoace haos în țară. În cele din urmă, controversa declanșată de ESI în 2003 a împins guvernul să reflecteze asupra rolului și puterilor lui Ashdown, precum și asupra modalităților în care acestea puteau fi modificate sau restricționate în interesul unei mai mari transparențe și responsabilități.

So they have to think they're invincible.\\" In other words, the psychology of being a winning athlete is often in conflict with being a prudent financial manager. Miller said that the best athletes and advisors can do is make sure that the spending is in proportion with their wealth. And for Mayweather, what looks like hyper-spending to others may be well within his budget. \\"What he is doing may be perfectly fine relative to his net worth,\\" Miller said. \\"It would be like you or me going out and buying a 300 pair of shoes.\\" Or for Mayweather, a pair of Bugattis. Summary:","completion":"The news article discusses the psychology of big spending for some athletes, such as Floyd Mayweather, and how it contributes to their confidence and dominance in their sports. According to Miller, the spending serves as a motivation and helps the athletes maintain their winning mindset as they believe they are invincible. However, this mindset often contradicts prudent financial management. Miller advises that the best athletes and their advisors can do is ensure that the spending is proportional to their wealth, making it crucial for athletes to manage their finances and maintain their confidence in a balanced way."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Royal caught two of the scoring passes for his second straight two-touchdown game. San Diego extended its winning streak to three. After Jacksonville took a 7-3 lead on a Toby Gerhart 1-yard TD run early in the second quarter, Rivers spotted Royal&#8212;guarded by linebacker Geno Hayes&#8212;who got open for a 47-yard touchdown reception. Jaguars rookie Blake Bortles, making his first start, followed with a scoring pass to Nic Jacobs. Before halftime, Rivers found Royal on third-and-10 as the receiver outran defenders for 43-yard TD pass, staking San Diego to a 17-14 lead. Rivers connected with Floyd on a 24-yard TD pass to open the third quarter, and the Chargers' defense held the Jaguars scoreless in the second half. Cornerback Brandon Flowers and safety Eric Weddle each intercepted Bortles in the second half after the Jacksonville quarterback began the game 13-for-15 with 144 yards. Rivers completed 29 of his 37 passes and had a 130.0 passer rating, his highest ever in a game in which he threw over 31 passes. Keenan Allen established career-highs of 10 catches for 135 yards, and Royal had five receptions for 105 yards, his first 100-yard game with the Chargers. Novak made four field goals.

Allan crouched over his desk once more, pen in hand and mind blank. He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago. He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture. He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward. Arthur looked up from the results of a night's frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye. \\"What is this?\\" he queried, indicating the pages he held in his left hand. \\"I decided that… since I wasn't having much success with more – traditional – stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,\\" Allan replied, somewhat less self-assured than he had been the previous night. \\"What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing,\\" cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice. \\"After all I said the day before, why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self-indulgent fantasy?\\" He shook the papers at Allan, raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son. \\"This is nothing but a glorified Grimm's tale, a miscarried child of Stoker, a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!\\" He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat. \\"Do you hate the modern system of literature?

Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, had poor relations with them, and failed to respect the chain of command in attempts at being transferred to another base. An argument evolves between base commander Colonel Nathan Jessup and his officers: while Jessup's executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson, advocates that Santiago be transferred immediately, Jessup regards this as akin to surrender and orders Santiago's commanding officer, Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick, to train Santiago to become a better Marine. When Dawson and Downey are later arrested for Santiago's murder, naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway suspects they carried out a \\"code red\\" order, a violent extrajudicial punishment. Galloway asks to defend them, but instead, the case is given to Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, an inexperienced and unenthusiastic U.S. Navy lawyer. Initially, friction exists between Galloway, who resents Kaffee's tendency to plea bargain, and Kaffee, who resents Galloway's interference. Kaffee and the prosecutor, his friend Captain Jack Ross (USMC), negotiate a bargain, but Dawson and Downey refuse to go along. They insist they were ordered by Kendrick to shave Santiago's head, minutes after Kendrick publicly ordered the platoon not to touch the would-be victim, and did not intend their victim to die. Kaffee is finally won over by Galloway and takes the case to court. In the course of the trial, the defense manages to establish the existence of \\"code red\\" orders at Guantanamo and that Dawson specifically had learned not to disobey any order, having been denied a promotion after helping out a fellow Marine who was under what could be seen as a \\"code red\\".

Jump off your board by placing your back foot onto the ground in front of the skateboard, and following with your front foot. Begin running in the direction that you were traveling in and only stop the board once you have slowed down and regained control. Practice your running technique from a stationary skateboard first. Once you have got the hang of this, try running from a moving board, in a quiet space. Only try this at the skate park after lots of practice. Bailing is when you opt out of a trick before you get hurt. If you know that you're about to fall hard, you can try and stop the trick before it's too late, and jump off your board. Rather a bruised ego, than a bruised leg! It is important to kick your board away when bailing, as you don't want to land back on your board and slip over. If you kick forward there is a greater chance that you will land back on the board, so always kick the board behind you by kicking your legs back. Bailing isn't good for your board deck, and it will cause scratches and chips. However, it is better to bail and chip your board, than to not bail and hurt yourself. If a fall is inevitable, you need to use all your limbs to soften the impact. It is important to keep your arms and legs loose so that they can absorb the shock of the fall. If you stiffen your body, there is a greater chance of you breaking bones. Keep those limbs loose! Don't break falls by using only your outstretched arms. Wrist injuries are rife in skateboarders, and this is going to hurt or cause you to break your wrists. It's a good idea to wear knee-pads and if you are going to fall whilst on a ramp, always fall on your knees. This will cause you to slide down the ramp, and avoid serious injury. Rolling distributes the impact of a fall and prevents serious injury. Remember to shield your face with your arms and aim to land on your back or shoulders. Practice falling correctly on a soft surface before you hit the skate park. This way you'll be prepared for future falls and falling safely will become second nature to you.","completion":"To avoid falling while skateboarding, try stepping off and running.

Answer based on context: Andrei Augostovich Eberhardt was an Admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy of Swedish ancestry. Eberhardt was born in Patras, Greece, where his father was the Russian consul. Eberhardt graduated from the Marine Cadet Corps in 1878. From 1882 to 1884, he served in the Pacific Fleet as a signals officer. In 1886, he became a flag officer and adjutant to Admiral Ivan Shestakov and in 1891 he became a flag officer to Admiral Tyrtov commanding the Russian Pacific Squadron. In 1896 Eberhardt was moved to the Black Sea Fleet, where he was gunnery officer on the battleships Ekaterina II and Chesma. In 1898 he moved to the Far East, where he commanded the Admiral Nakhimov and took part in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion. During the Russo-Japanese War, Eberhardt was chief naval aide to Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, the viceroy of Manchuria. In 1905, he was captain of the battleship Imperator Aleksandr II and in 1906 he was made captain of the Panteleimon. He was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1907 and Vice Admiral in 1909. Eberhardt was Russia's Chief of the Russian Naval General Staff from 1908 and Commander-in-Chief of the Black Sea Fleet from 1911. During World War I, his top achievement was setting up a naval blockade of the Zonguldak coal fields, choking the coal supply of the German-Turkish fleet. He also commanded the Russian battleship squadron during the Battle of Cape Sarych. However he was cautious to start further offensive actions against Turkish positions in the Bosporus and was replaced by Aleksandr Kolchak in 1916. Eberhardt retired from service in 1917 and was arrested by the Cheka in 1918 but released. He died in 1919 and is buried in the Novodeviche Cemetery in Petrograd.

This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Literary career\\" correctly answer the question \\"Which group worked against the Nazis?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"Literary career\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Which group worked against the Nazis?\\".

The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy.

The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined, and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making. Its members were usually appointed by Roman Censors, who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate, making the senate a partially elected body.

Race on to find Gulf Coast dolphin killers Gulfport, Mississippi (CNN) -- Someone has turned a crucial dolphin birthing area off the U.S. Gulf Coast into a killing zone and the race is on to find the culprit or culprits before the marine mammals begin giving birth and the newborn dolphins are put at risk. \\"There is a sense of urgency.

It's really senseless. It's repugnant. It's illegal.

At least seven carcasses have turned up along a 120-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast, from Louisiana in the west to Florida in the east. Some have gunshot wounds, others have been mutilated, including one with its jaw cut off. Solangi, who performed necropsies of all the slaughtered dolphins, said the cruelty of what he's seen is the equivalent of having your pet dog's neck sliced. \\"This is gruesome really,\\" Solangi said. \\"It's not only killing them, it's also mutilating them. And the parts that are taken are disposed of; not next to the animal, they are taken.

In June, a bottlenose dolphin was found in Perdido Bay, Florida, near the Florida-Alabama state line, with a screwdriver stuck in its head. In September, one was found on Elmers Island, Louisiana, with a gunshot wound. On October 10, a dolphin was found on the beach in Dauphin Island, Alabama with its fluke cut off. The list gets worse from there. On November 6, a dolphin was found in near Ocean Springs, Mississippi, dead from numerous cuts. Three days later two more were discovered; another one with bullet wounds near Ocean Springs, and one on Ship Island, a remote barrier island off Biloxi, Mississippi, that was found with its jaw cut off. Authorities are still trying to determine if a dead dolphin found November 2, in Bayou Julia, Louisiana, is linked to the other killings. To stop the slaughter before the dolphins' birthing season, which begins soon, federal authorities say they need the public's help. \\"We need to have witnesses come forward. We need public input and information,\\" said Jeff Radonski, a deputy special agent for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is leading the hunt for the dolphin killer or killers. Investigators hope the culprit has bragged to friends or acquaintances about the killings. The large area over which the carcasses have been found make the investigation more difficult, Radonski said. There could be several motives for the slaughter -- it might be someone who is a \\"thrill seeker,\\" or fishermen who found the dolphins interfering with their operations on the water, he explained. In at least two previous cases, fishing charter captains have been found guilty of shooting at dolphins that approached their boats, or the fish their passengers had hooked, NOAA told CNN. The Marine Mammal Protection Act states that anyone convicted of killing a dolphin could be sentenced to one year in prison and fined up to 100,000. The law also makes it a crime to feed dolphins in the wild. Lt. Col. Claude Pittman, who patrols in the area of the killings for the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources, said he hasn't seen a dolphin shot in his 22 years of work. But these dolphin killings are making him fearful. \\"You don't know what type of person is doing this,\\" he said. \\"Would they carry it any further? I have no idea.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"A series of dolphin killings and mutilations have been reported along a 120-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast, prompting a race to find the perpetrator(s) before the marine mammals begin birthing and put newborn dolphins at risk.

Physical properties include the state of matter. We know these states as solid, liquid, or gas. Properties can also include color and odor. For example, oxygen is a gas. It is a major part of the air we breathe. It is colorless and odorless. Chlorine is also a gas. In contrast to oxygen, chlorine is greenish in color. It has a strong, sharp odor. Have you ever smelled cleaning products used around your home? If so, you have probably smelled chlorine. Another place you might smell chlorine is at a public swimming pool. The chlorine is used to kill bacteria that may grow in the water. Other physical properties include hardness, freezing, and boiling points. Some substances have the ability to dissolve in other substances. Some substances cannot be dissolved. For example, salt easily dissolves in water. Oil does not dissolve in water.

From work-related pressures to personal issues, it seems like a never-ending struggle that affects our mental and physical well-being. According to the American Institute of Stress, more than 77% of people regularly experience physical symptoms caused by stress. Given these disheartening statistics, it is crucial to find effective ways to relax and manage stress. By incorporating simple activities such as wiggling toes, scrunching faces or making a fist, along with open communication with your partner, you can maintain a healthy emotional and physical balance in your life. 1. Try to Relax – Understand That You Are Okay The first step in reducing stress is to acknowledge your current state and realize that the situation is manageable. Remind yourself that you are okay and, with some effort, you can overcome the challenge at hand. This initial positive affirmation is important as it helps you eliminate excessive worries and focus on creating a solution-oriented mindset. 2. Wiggle Your Toes, Scrunch Your Face, or Make a Fist – Engage Your Body In Relaxation Techniques Engaging in physical relaxation techniques is an excellent way to combat stress. These simple actions help relax the body and ultimately reduce the adverse effects of stress on your mental and physical well-being. Some practical techniques include: a. Wiggling your toes: This simple motion helps increase blood circulation in the feet and promotes relaxation of the various muscles in the lower extremities. b. Scrunching your face: By scrunching your face and then releasing the tension, you can effectively relax the facial muscles and alleviate some tension in the head and neck area. c. Making a fist: Clenching your fists for a few seconds and then releasing the tension can reduce stress and promote relaxation in the palms and fingers. 3. Talk to Your Partner – The Importance of Communication One of the best ways to deal with stress is to share your thoughts and feelings with someone close to you. Often, just verbalizing your concerns and listening to your partner's insight can help put things into perspective and provide you with a fresh outlook. Moreover, maintaining open communication with your partner strengthens the bond you share, making you feel emotionally supported and less stressed. This emotional connection will benefit both of your well-being, resulting in a healthier, happier relationship. Conclusion In conclusion, stress has become an unfortunate inevitability in the modern world. However, by adopting practical relaxation techniques and fostering open communication with your partner, you can learn to manage stress effectively. The key is to invest in your emotional and physical health through exercise, healthy communication, and self-awareness. Remember, we may not be able to avoid stress completely, but we have the power to control how it affects our lives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Luke Gatti was charged May 28 in Boca Raton with battery on an officer and resisting an officer with violence. According to the Hartford Courant, the incident took place at a treatment facility for people dealing with drug addiction and mental illness. Last year, the 20-year-old was arrested over his Oct. 4, 2015, outburst in the Student Union. He ranted at and shoved a university food service supervisor for refusing to sell him the macaroni and cheese. The altercation was caught on video and was widely viewed online. Gatti was put on probation and released his own video in which he apologized for his actions. Article:","completion":"Once upon a time, there was a young man named Luke Gatti, who used to be a student at the University of Connecticut. One day, he really wanted to eat jalapeno-bacon macaroni and cheese. But because he was not in a good mood and was using bad words, the person working at the food place didn't want to sell him the yummy macaroni and cheese. This made Luke very angry and he started to shout and push the food service supervisor. Someone recorded the whole thing on their phone, and many people saw it online. After that happened, Luke was punished, and he had to be on probation. Probation is like a time-out for grown-ups when they do something wrong. He felt bad and said he was sorry in a video. But recently, Luke got into trouble again, and this time it was in Florida. He was at a place where people go for help if they have problems with drugs or if they are not feeling well in their minds. Something happened with a police officer there, and it was not nice. Luke was arrested for doing some not-so-good things, like fighting with the officer and not listening to him. It is important to remember that sometimes people make mistakes, and they need help to learn from them and become better persons. So, let's hope that Luke will learn from his mistakes and try to be more gentle and kind in the future."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that he was glad to be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent. Ewbank's coaching style was laid-back but efficient, combining his mild personality with an orderliness inherited from Paul Brown. \\"Weeb combined a low-key style with a flair for the most dramatic of accomplishments\\", former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 1998. \\"He led two of the legendary teams during the era of pro football's greatest growth. But he preferred to stay in the background and let the players take the credit.\\" He favored well-practiced execution of a limited number of plays over complicated offensive and defensive systems. Paul Brown \\"had the exact same approach: Don't do too much, but what you do, execute it flawlessly\\", Raymond Berry said in 2013, adding that the Colts' 1958 championship team had only six passing plays. Ewbank is the only man to coach two professional football teams to championships, and the only man to win the NFL championship, the AFL championship and a Super Bowl. Ewbank's regular-season career record in the NFL and AFL was 130-129-7, and his playoff record was 4-1. Ewbank was selected as the head coach on the AFL All-Time Team in 1970. In addition to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was inducted into the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1969, the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1974 and the Talawanda School District Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. He also won the Walter Camp Distinguished American Award in 1987 and was inducted into the Jets' Ring of Honor in 2010. Ewbank suffered a dislocated hip in the aftermath of the Jets' 1968 AFL championship game win, and had other health issues in his later years. He broke his leg and had two hip replacements in the 1990s. He also had myasthenia in his right eye.

Her older sister is an unwed mother living on welfare. Her older brother is a drug-dealing junkie. In the course of the film, Cynthia faces chaos and betrayal. One of her friends is deliberately murdered, while another of her loved ones is accidentally shot. She runs from the police at one point, and to them at another. But through it all, Cynthia has a secret friend: Anne Frank. In a flashback scene early in the film, Cynthiaâs now-dead father gives his young daughter a dog-eared copy of The Diary Of Anne Frank and for the rest of the film Anneâs words, read verbatim by Cynthia, provide both her solace and her inspiration. Cynthia buys herself a plaid notebook that looks very much like Anneâs original, and she retreats to her corner, like Anne did, to record her private thoughts. âAll children must look after their own upbringing,â she reads, and from these words she understands that she can either blame her surroundings and give up, or take responsibility for her own future. She finds out that her brother is selling her poems to a rapper named âDeuceâ who has been performing them and recording them and claiming them as his own. But with Anneâs voice in her head, Cynthia finds her courage, and by the end of the film she has transformed herself into an artist named âAnne B. Real.â The answer is:","completion":"Cynthia's now-dead father gave The Diary of Anne Frank to Cynthia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Well, there are plenty of reasons for that, not the least of which is that our version had a nine-season run compared to the 15-episode original series over there. That’s a lot of years to grow attached to a group of people, no matter their character flaws. But the main reason is that, for all our recession-era bitterness and anxiety, Americans are huggers and criers. We completely buy into what “Generation X” author Douglas Coupland once termed the “air family” – those co-workers and fellow travelers to whom we become attached simply because of the time we’ve done together in the cubicle trenches. In America, familiarity may indeed breed contempt, but it’s also an excellent way to harvest sap. Like all real-life office workers, the characters in “The Office” may yet discover the real meaning of air family now that they are largely apart: Over the years they’ll have less to talk about and nothing in common. They’ll forget about one another. This seems an obscene and frigid notion in the face of the lovefest we were shown Thursday night. After an hour-long special spent luxuriating in “The Office’s” tender trap, the writers and producers of the show chose to fixate more (much, much more) on happy endings instead of the sharp comedy that got them to this point. This meant that Steve Carell returned late in the episode as Michael Scott, to serve as the surprise best man at the wedding of Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) – a welcome sight, but oddly lacking in funny lines for Michael. “I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It’s every parent’s dream,” he said, in a prime example of the finale’s propensity to favor Kleenex over comedy. In other (spoiler) news: Kelly and Ryan (Mindy Kaling and B.J. Novak) ran off together once more. (Kaling had one of the smarter observations during the hour-long special: All you young couples who model your own romance on the Jim-and-Pam ideal might do better to admit that most relationships look a lot more like the narcissistic doom that surrounds Kelly and Ryan.) The PBS documentary project that formed “The Office’s” mockumentary conceit aired in its entirety and brought little tumult to the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin, but it did reunite the office receptionist – never-adopted-foster-child Erin (Ellie Kemper) – with her birth parents. (Played by Joan Cusack and Ed Begley Jr., in a clever bit of casting.) Jenna Fischer snaps a picture on May 4, 2013 in downtown Scranton, Pa. during “The Office” Parade and wrap party. Both the retrospective special and the final episode leaned heavily on Jenna Fischer (both as herself and as Pam Beesly Halpert) for emotional grounding and articulate finish. My favorite part about the end of “The Office” was Pam’s confession that she never finished watching the documentary. She just couldn’t stand to watch herself missing out on life – taking too long to fall in love with Jim (John Krasinski) or pursue her art career or move beyond Dunder Mifflin. Pam had the exact reaction we all had to Pam in the beginning: She wanted to scream at her. “Life just isn’t that long,” Pam cautioned the viewers, in a moving speech that veered close to the platitudes of the YOLO handbook. But it was also Pam who most succinctly wrapped up the reason why America became so hooked on a show about something as banal as life in a drab office that sells paper: “There’s a lot of beauty in ordinary things,” she said. “Isn’t that the point?” Then we came to the end: It’s our last day at ‘The Office’ Watch: Eight great ‘Office’ moments, chosen by Angela Kinsey Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The American version of \\"The Office\\" had a warmer and more emotionally-invested tone compared to its more cynical British counterpart, cultivating a sense of \\"air family\\" among the characters.

Q:FINAL EXAM Question 1. Which family does Mappia racemose, which grows on the fourth largest island in the Caribbean? A:","completion":"Mappia racemosa, a rare and endemic plant species, belongs to the Icacinaceae family. This particular family consists of tropical and subtropical evergreen trees, shrubs, and lianas. The Icacinaceae family contains approximately 55 genera and 400 species that are distributed across Africa, Madagascar, Asia, the Americas, and the islands of the Pacific. The Mappia racemosa species is specifically found on the fourth largest island in the Caribbean, which is Jamaica. Jamaica has a host of unique and diverse flora, some of which are endemic to the island due to its isolated nature and varied topography. The Mappia racemosa is one such example of a native plant that has adapted to the island's environmental conditions. The Mappia racemosa plant is characterized by its racemose inflorescence, meaning that its flowers are arranged on a central axis with the oldest flowers situated at the base and younger flowers further up the stem. This arrangement is typical of the Icacinaceae family and is a distinguishing feature for the Mappia racemosa species. The plant's natural habitat includes limestone forests, lower montane wet forests, and moist regions in Jamaica. These environments provide optimal conditions for the plant to thrive, with sufficient moisture, sunlight, and nutrients available. The Mappia racemosa species is of ecological significance as it contributes to the overall biodiversity of the Caribbean region. Given its rarity and limited distribution, it is important to monitor and conserve this species to prevent further decline in its population. Conservation efforts could involve habitat restoration, protection of vital ecosystems, and awareness campaigns to promote the importance of preserving endemic Caribbean flora. In summary, the Mappia racemosa plant is a member of the Icacinaceae family and is endemic to the fourth largest Caribbean island, Jamaica. It is a rare species with distinctive racemose inflorescence and can be found in select habitats such as limestone forests and lower montane wet forests. Its conservation is vital for maintaining the rich biological diversity of the Caribbean region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Their relationship become serious enough that Bob persuades Sally to quit her job, promising to break the news to Franz. The next day however, Franz informs Sally that Bob has gone back home to take care of business and that she should forget him. She, however, is unwilling to accept this and goes to the police with a theory about Franz' role in her boyfriend's disappearance (\\"He made Bob into a doll!\\"), but Sergeant Paterson (Jack Kosslyn) is skeptical.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart? ? After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus. Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring. The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose More rain than usual happens, how will it affect MORE regulation of blood sugar level being needed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The process described above is the regulation of blood sugar levels in the human body, specifically the response to low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). The steps outlined are as follows: 1. The blood sugar drops in a body. 2. Cells in the pancreas (alpha cells) release glucagon. 3. The liver converts glucagon into glucose through a process called glycogenolysis (breaking down glycogen into glucose) and gluconeogenesis (generating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources). 4. The liver releases glucose into the blood, increasing blood sugar levels. 5. The blood sugar levels are restored. The perturbation hypothesis proposed is that there is more rain than usual. It is important to determine if this change in weather has a direct or indirect effect on the regulation of blood sugar levels. Direct effects: Rain and blood sugar regulation are not directly related as there are no physiological mechanisms in the human body that respond to increased rainfall to trigger changes in blood sugar levels. A direct effect would require rain to somehow influence the synthesis, secretion, or reception of glucagon and insulin, which are hormones directly involved in blood sugar regulation, or the rate at which glucose is synthesized and released from the liver. Indirect effects: While it is unlikely that there is any direct effect of increased rainfall on blood sugar regulation, there could be indirect effects related to changes in behavior, diet, or physical activity levels. For example: - Changes in diet: Increased rainfall could influence a person's diet, causing them to consume more or fewer carbohydrates, which in turn could affect blood sugar levels. Additionally, the availability and quality of food in agricultural regions might be affected by changes in rainfall, which could also indirectly influence a person's diet. - Physical activity levels: People might be less likely to engage in outdoor activities due to poor weather conditions, resulting in lower levels of physical activity. Reduced physical activity can impact blood sugar regulation, as physical activity generally leads to an increase in insulin sensitivity and can help maintain stable blood sugar levels. - Emotional stress: Changes in weather, such as increased rainfall, might affect mood and emotional state. Stress and related hormones can impact blood sugar regulation, potentially leading to an increase in both blood sugar levels and a greater regulation need. - Health conditions: Increased rainfall can impact health conditions, such as asthma, allergies, or arthritis, which might indirectly affect blood sugar regulation if these conditions alter diet, physical activity, or overall health. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis stating that more rain than usual might impact the regulation of blood sugar levels in the human body does not have a direct effect on the process. However, there can be indirect effects through changes in behavior, diet, physical activity, and health conditions. These indirect effects would need to be evaluated on an individual basis, as the impacts could vary among people depending on their unique circumstances and responses to environmental changes like increased rainfall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Spoiled playboy Bob Merrick's (Rock Hudson) reckless behaviour causes him to lose control of his speedboat. Rescuers send for the nearest resuscitator, located in Dr. Phillips's house across the lake. While the resuscitator is being used to save Merrick, Dr. Phillips suffers a heart attack and dies. Merrick ends up a patient at Dr. Phillips's clinic, where most of the doctors and nurses resent the fact that Merrick inadvertently caused Dr. Phillips's death. Helen Phillips, Dr. Phillips's widow, receives a flood of calls, letters, and visitors all offering to pay back loans that Dr. Phillips refused to accept repayment of during his life. Many claimed he refused by saying \\"it was already used up.\\" Edward Randolph, a famous artist and Dr. Phillips's close friend, explains to Helen what that phrase means. This helps her to understand why her husband left little money, even though he had a very successful practice. Merrick discovers why everyone dislikes him. He runs from the clinic but collapses in front of Helen's car and ends up back at the hospital, where she learns his true identity. After his discharge, Merrick leaves a party, drunk. Merrick runs off the road and ends up at the home of Edward Randolph, who recognizes him. Randolph explains the secret belief that powered his own art and Dr. Phillips's success. Merrick decides to try out this new philosophy. His first attempt causes Helen to step into the path of a car while trying to run away from Merrick's advances. She is left blind as a result of this accident. Merrick soberly commits to becoming a doctor, trying to fulfill Dr. Phillips's legacy. He also has fallen in love with Helen and secretly helps her adjust to her blindness under the guise of being simply a poor medical student, Robby.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding and the situation: Two different types of animals live in the same habitat but have vastly different behaviors. Animals A and B are both the same size which is relatively small. Animal A lives in small groups of 4 or 5. Animal B however lives in very large groups and when they move around they all move at the same time. Both groups are also hunted by the same predator. Answer the following question: Which group likely relies on confusing potential predators, group A or B? Answer:","completion":"Group B likely relies on confusing potential predators. This is because they live in very large groups and move in synchrony when moving around, similar to schools of sardines and flocks of starlings mentioned in the background information. Such synchronized movement and herding behavior tend to create a confusion effect on predators, making it more difficult for them to single out and catch individual prey. The larger the group, the more effective this confusion effect would be, as there are more individuals involved in the coordinated movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Damian Dovarganes/Associated Press) The clamor to repeal the state's permissive \\"opt out\\" vaccination policy appears to be overwhelming the state's anti-vaccine movement as the number of measles cases climbs. Gov. Jerry Brown -- who pushed for more parental choice just two years ago -- quickly signaled that he was open to reform. \\"The governor believes that vaccinations are profoundly important and a major public health benefit and any bill that reaches his desk will be closely considered,\\" said Evan Westrup, Brown's spokesman. \\"This is an important tipping point ... when state governments consider badly needed reforms where exemptions have been far too easy to obtain,\\" said bioethicist Jason Schwartz, who studies vaccine policy at the Princeton University Center for Human Values. Advertisement The political push comes at a time when the state is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in two decades. There are now at least 99 Californians infected with the extremely contagious measles virus. Of these, 39 were exposed while visiting Disneyland in December and another 23 contracted the virus from members of their household or close contacts. Three infections were acquired in the community, such as simply sharing space in a hospital emergency room. Vaccine exemptions have been available since 1961, when California first required all public school teachers and students to be inoculated against polio. But there has been a surge in their popularity in recent years. From 2000 to 2014, the rate of parents seeking exemptions tripled, from 0.77 percent to 2.5 percent -- or one in every 40 kids. California is one of 19 states that allow exemptions based purely on parents' personal beliefs. \\"An exemption is something we can only allow under the condition where it very rarely is exercised,\\" said Stanford University's David Magnus, a professor of pediatrics who directs the Center for Biomedical Ethics. \\"The fact that there has been so much misuse means it is time to tighten things.\\" Politically, the well-to-do \\"all-natural\\" parents who have come to symbolize the anti-vaccination movement in California simply don't have many political supporters in Sacramento, said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a veteran political analyst at the University of Southern California. Two potential Republican presidential candidates who have questioned forcing parents to get their children vaccinated -- such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky -- are pandering to the sorts of anti-government primary voters who could torpedo their chances of reaching a general election, Jeffe said. But in California, so far no state lawmakers have publicly opposed the proposed legislation -- and there's little reason to believe opposition will succeed in a solidly blue state like California, she said. Still, state Republicans are treading carefully for now. Bob Huff, the state Senate's Republican leader, said, \\"We look forward to reviewing the proposed legislation in detail and weighing what appropriate actions should be taken in the coming months. \\"Many Californians are rightfully asking if this is because of California's 'exemption' clause, which has prompted a larger debate of our state's youth vaccination policies,\\" Huff added. \\"While medical experts are overwhelmingly in agreement that vaccines are safe, preserving the freedom of choice has also emerged as part of this important discussion.\\" While both \\"personal belief\\" and \\"religious\\" exemptions are available, most parents use the \\"personal belief\\" option. Vaccine experts cautioned that repeal of just that option could drive parents to choose the \\"religious\\" option instead. Governments are reluctant to police religious objections because \\"they do not want to become guardians of people's conscience\\" -- and it's unclear whether the Constitution allows them to, said Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, a law professor at UC Hastings College of the Law. California's vaccine policy was tightened in 2012 by then-Assemblyman Pan, who introduced a law that required parents seeking exemptions to receive counseling and signatures from health care professionals. The move led to a 20 percent decrease in parents opting out of vaccinating their kindergartners. But despite this effort, many children remain unvaccinated. One problem has been that vaccine conversations can be initiated by naturopaths, who practice alternative medicine and typically oppose vaccination. Santa Cruz parent Amy Kelchner, who practices naturopathy and is authorized to write vaccine exemptions, supports the continued availabilty of exemptions because she believes vaccines should be given only to healthy children over age 3. \\"Public health refuses to consider the possibility that the astronomical rates of allergies, autism, chronic disease -- all legitimate public health concerns -- might have something to do with the overuse of suppressive medication, including vaccines,\\" she wrote in an email. But many Bay Area parents and children traveled to Sacramento to urge a change in policy. \\"My husband and I worry our son will get sick if we put him in day care,\\" said Palo Alto mother Leah Russin, holding her 16-month-old son. \\"Many day cares in our area have vaccination rates well below what is necessary to protect the community.\\" Mountain View's Gina Lunde, also holding her toddler son, said, \\"The studies I've read show that it's impossible to change the minds\\" of opponents. \\"We need this legislation to keep our kids safe,\\" she said. ||||| LOS ANGELES Responding to an outbreak of measles that has infected more than 100 people, two California lawmakers said on Wednesday they would introduce legislation to end the right of parents in the state to exempt their children from school vaccinations based on personal beliefs. California public health officials say 92 people have been diagnosed with measles in the state, many of them linked to an outbreak that they believe began when an infected person from outside the country visited Disneyland in late December. More than a dozen other cases have been confirmed in 19 other U.S. states and Mexico, renewing a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked science, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated. \\"The high number of unvaccinated students is jeopardizing public health not only in schools but in the broader community. We need to take steps to keep our schools safe and our students healthy,” state Senator Ben Allen said in a written statement announcing the legislation he is co-sponsoring with fellow Democrat Richard Pan. The measure would make California the 33rd state to bar parents from opting out of vaccinations based on personal beliefs. Also on Wednesday, a top Los Angeles County health official said that a total of 21 cases have been recorded in the county but that after the initial wave of reports, the number has fallen to four in the latest two-week period. “We're getting to a number of cases that’s manageable, and I'm hopeful that within weeks or a couple of months we will be able to turn the corner on this particular outbreak,” Interim Health Officer Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser told a press conference, although he cautioned that a lag in reporting could still add a few more cases. A day care center at a high school in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica closed earlier this week and more than a dozen infants placed under a three-week quarantine after a baby enrolled in the program was diagnosed with measles. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But last year the nation had its highest number of measles cases in two decades. Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases.

Our problem is: -44 * n = 24 * n - 340 Let's break it down step-by-step and solve it together. Step 1: We want to get all the terms with 'n' on one side of the equation. So, let's move 24 * n to the left side by subtracting it from both sides: -44 * n - 24 * n = -340 Step 2: Now, let's combine the 'n' terms on the left side: (-44 - 24) * n = -340 That simplifies to: -68 * n = -340 Step 3: To find the value of 'n', we want to get it all by itself on one side. Since 'n' is being multiplied by -68, we'll divide both sides by -68: n = -340 / -68 Step 4: Now we just need to do the division: n = 5 So, the answer is n = 5. That means if we replace 'n' in the original equation with 5, it will make the equation true! Great job solving this together!"},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

The reviewer also highlights specific aspects of the product that they enjoyed, such as the perfect ratio of candy coating to concealed licorice. This not only hints at the product's high quality but also gives potential buyers a better understanding of what they can expect regarding the product's taste and texture.

The most common cause of corns and calluses on the feet is something causing irritation, pressure, or friction in the same spot. By eliminating the source of the friction, you can prevent corns and calluses from forming. Shoes that do not fit can rub against your toes or cause your foot to slide inside the shoe. Be sure your toes have plenty of wiggle room inside your shoes. Corns develop along the tops and sides of your toes, and can be due to wearing shoes that do not give your toes enough room. Repeated rubbing or irritation caused by shoes that do not fit properly are a major cause of corns of calluses. Tightly fitting shoes and shoes with high heels that cause your fit to slide forward can cause corns and calluses to develop. Calluses develop when the bottom or side of the foot slides against a part of the shoe that is irritating, or slides inside of shoes that are too large. Going without socks can cause your feet to experience friction and pressure from your shoes. Always wear socks to prevent the friction and pressure. Especially in shoes that are designed to wear socks, such as athletic foot wear, heavy work shoes, and boots. Be sure your socks fit properly. Socks that are too tight can squeeze your toes causing unwanted pressure and friction. Loosely fitting socks can slide down on your foot while in the shoe and contribute to added friction and pressure on areas of your foot. Use pads placed on top of the areas where the corns develop, between your toes, or along areas where the calluses form. Using pads, sections lamb’s wool, or toe separators can help to reduce the friction and pressure along your toe or foot area where the corns and calluses are located. Calluses form on your hands at the areas of greatest friction. In many cases, calluses on the hand are welcomed. One example involves people that play musical instruments. Guitar players, for instance, appreciate the calluses that form on the tips of their fingers. This helps them to play their instrument without pain. Another example is athletes that lift weights. The calluses that form on their hands can help them to grasp and manipulate the bars used in weight lifting.

Title: Syriana Movie plot: U.S. energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption. Emir storyline[edit] Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.

Sentence 2: A person might be human, even when they were a zombie, if they had enough character. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's analyze both sentences step by step: Step 1: Understand the meaning of both sentences - Sentence 1 communicates the idea that it is unfair for someone with a strong character to be eliminated without any thought, even if they're a zombie. - Sentence 2 conveys the idea that someone can still be considered human if they have enough character, even if they are a zombie. Step 2: Compare the information in both sentences - Both sentences discuss the relationship between character and being a zombie. - However, the first sentence specifically discusses the fairness of wiping out someone with character, while the second one addresses the notion of being considered human. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first - The first sentence implies that there can be zombies with character, and that it is unfair to wipe them out without consideration. - Although it doesn't explicitly state that these zombies are considered human, that being \\"human\\" is a core aspect of having character is implied. Thus, the first sentence indirectly suggests that a person might still be viewed as human even when they're a zombie, based on their character.

The first sentence establishes the importance of character even in a zombie, and as a result, the second sentence becomes a plausible and related conclusion that can be derived from this premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Francisco de Ibarra was a Spanish explorer and conquistador in the 16th century who played a significant role in the exploration and conquest of what is now known as northern Mexico. He embarked on a series of expeditions that expanded Spanish influence in the region over several years. One such expedition took him to the area of modern-day Casas Grandes, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, where the archaeological site of Paquime is located. Paquime, also known as Casas Grandes, is an important archaeological site in the north of Mexico, dating back to the late Pre-Columbian period. Paquime was inhabited by the ancient Casas Grandes culture, also known as the Mogollon, between approximately AD 1130 and 1450. The site showcases a unique blend of architectural styles, combining influences from puebloan cultures in the north and Mesoamerican cultures in central and southern Mexico. This mixture is evident in the adobe architecture, ceramics, and artifacts discovered at Paquime. Excavations at the site have revealed a complex urban center featuring multi-story buildings, plazas, workshops, and an extensive, sophisticated water control system. Paquime was also an important center for trade, connecting the various cultural groups within the region. Turquoise, shells, copper, and macaws were traded, as well as goods from even more distant regions like Central Mexico and the American Southwest. Francisco de Ibarra, following in the footsteps of his uncle, Diego de Ibarra, helped expand Spanish control and influence in the north of Mexico throughout the 1560s and 1570s. It is thought that during his expeditions, Francisco de Ibarra encountered the ruins of Paquime, making him the first known European to see the remains of this once-thriving ancient city. This discovery signified the richness and complexity of the pre-Columbian cultures that inhabited the region before the arrival of the Europeans, providing valuable insights into the history and heritage of the region in which Paquime played a significant role."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

In the original line-up, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Slayer has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" and one in 2008 for the song \\"Final Six\\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold five million albums in the United States. After 37 years of recording and performing, Slayer announced in January 2018 that they would embark on their final world tour, which began that May and is estimated to wrap up in 2019 or 2020., what would be the answer ?

Q:Question: \\"What is the full name of the organization that claimed censorship by the Tajik government in 2010?\\" Context: \\"The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The full name of the organization that claimed censorship by the Tajik government in 2010 is the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE is an international organization that aims to promote peace, security, and stability in Europe and its neighboring regions. It monitors and reports on various aspects of governance and human rights, including freedom of the press and media. In this particular instance, the OSCE criticized the Tajik government for its censorship and repression of both local and foreign media, as well as its negative impact on the operation of independent newspapers."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who said Saint-Saëns's operas were \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s?\\" ? Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

Is Subsequently, Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature. a good answer to this question?","completion":"While the provided statement does mention Plato and Aristotle's considerable contributions to the development of natural philosophy, it doesn't specifically address the question about the discussion technique they are responsible for. A more appropriate and detailed answer would be: Plato and Aristotle are often credited with developing the philosophical discussion technique known as \\"dialectic\\" or \\"dialectical method.\\" This method involves structured discussions between two or more people, where opposing views are presented and debated in order to arrive at a greater understanding of the topic at hand or establish a consensus. The dialectic method relies on reasoned arguments and critical thinking, serving to uncover philosophical truths by examining different perspectives. Plato's Socratic Dialogues, a series of written works featuring Socrates as the protagonist, best exemplify this technique. In these dialogues, Socrates engages in discourse with various people and asks a series of questions, pushing them to question their own beliefs and ultimately reach a greater understanding. This process is also referred to as the \\"Socratic method\\" or \\"elenchus.\\" Aristotle, a student of Plato, also employed dialectic in his works, though he developed and refined the technique further. Aristotle maintained that dialectic helped in forming genuine knowledge by identifying the basic principles and axioms through a process of gathering information, challenging premises, and testing conclusions. Aristotle's dialectic can be found across his vast body of work, touching on topics such as metaphysics, ethics, politics, and natural sciences. Consequently, both Plato and Aristotle contributed significantly to the evolution of dialectic, shaping the discussions and debates that would occur in philosophical and intellectual circles for centuries to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" was written by Beyoncé, Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash, Thaddis \\"Kuk\\" Harrell, and Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am...

This is the only mention of prisoners taken throughout the war. Gunib was relieved the next day. North up the canyon was Gerghebil which was considered the key to the relief of Kunzakh. On 7 or 8 January 2686 men began the attack. On 26 January the place fell to a night attack. Todorsky justified the heavy losses on the grounds that difficult victories demoralized the enemy. Two days later Khunzakh was relieved for a second time. The next move was north down the canyon to Arikani and Gimry. Arikani fell on 14 February. Gimry had been battered by artillery from late December, ninety percent of the village being destroyed. On 18 February it surrendered. With the core area occupied other places began to surrender. On the 19th Ashitla west of Gimry was occupied by 125 officer cadets. All were killed during the night and the next day 52 mutilated bodies were found. It is not clear what provoked this unusual brutality. The area to the northwest to the Chechen border was occupied: Botlikh , Andi and northward . On 9-13 March the Dagestan Reds linked up with those in Chechnya. On 15 March the Petrovsk Military Soviet declared the uprising liquidated. Meanwhile, on 25 February, Tiflis was occupied by the Red army. With Georgia now under Soviet control the remaining rebels in Dagestan were surrounded. The rebels made their last stand at Gidatl where the uprising was first organized. It fell in May. Small bands continued to resist until the end of May. The remaining insurgents dispersed to their villages. Said Bey fled to Turkey. The war took the lives of 5000 Reds and an unknown number of mountaineers.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: Abradab, genre, Hip hop music; Hip hop music, derivative, Drum and bass; Hip hop music, stylisticOrigin, Disco. Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"This data pertains to various aspects of the music genre and its intricacies, specifically focusing on the relationship between Abradab, Hip hop music, Drum and bass, and Disco. These elements are interconnected in the world of music, growing from one another or evolving in similar or distinct directions. In this detailed description, each of these music-related elements will be individually analyzed and their connections highlighted. 1. Abradab: Abradab is a musical group or artist that is associated with the genre of Hip hop music. They prominently use elements from the hip hop universe to create and express their musical identity. From this data, it can be inferred that Abradab is involved in the hip hop community, contributing to its soundscape and engaging with its audience. 2. Hip hop music: Hip hop music, also referred to as rap music, is a genre that originated in the African American and Latinx communities of the Bronx in New York City during the 1970s. It encompasses various stylistic elements, such as rapping (a vocal delivery technique), DJing, breakdancing, and graffiti art. Hip hop music has various derivatives and subgenres, with numerous musical acts and bands contributing to its evolution and growth over time. This data highlights the genre's significance to Abradab, the influence of Drum and bass, and its beginnings rooted in Disco music. 3. Drum and bass: Drum and Bass is a genre of electronic music characterized by its fast tempo, energetic beats, and heavy basslines. It originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, drawing influences and samples from various styles, such as breakbeat, techno, and reggae. Based on this data, Drum and bass is a derivative of Hip hop music, indicating that some of its elements or influences can be traced back to the hip hop genre. This connection suggests an overlap of stylistic features and a shared musical history between the two genres. 4.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"If the plates were to move more quickly past each other, it would directly impact a step of the process. Since the movement speed of the tectonic plates has increased, the force exerted between them would also increase more rapidly over time. This means that the crust has a higher likelihood of breaking sooner, and the stress, which leads to an earthquake, is released at a shorter interval. As a result of the more frequent release of stress, there might be more earthquakes, but they could potentially be weaker in intensity. This is because there's a lesser chance of a massive build-up of stress and force before the crust breaks, so the energy released in each earthquake might be lower than if the plates moved slower. However, it's important to note that this is a hypothetical situation, and the actual impacts could vary depending on many geological factors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police. The plan seems foolproof until he is forced to care for the dog of Scarff's dog.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:It means \\"nothing happens\\" but people often use it reassuringly as in: \\"Don't worry about it, it's nothing.\\" When it comes to solving murders, \\"no pasa nada\\" is a pretty accurate description. According to Mexico's statistics institute, 98% of homicides in 2012 went unsolved. The culture of impunity is frightening. The 31 July murder of photojournalist Ruben Espinosa along with four women in a middle-class neighbourhood of Mexico City is a crime that many fear will once again go unsolved. Mr Espinosa worked as a photojournalist in the eastern state of Veracruz for the investigative magazine Proceso, among others. He had recently left Veracruz for Mexico City because of safety fears. Veracruz is the most dangerous place to be a journalist in Mexico, which itself is deemed one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. Nationwide, 88 journalists have been murdered since 2000, according to free speech organisation Article 19. Fourteen journalists from Veracruz state alone have died since current governor Javier Duarte took office in 2010. That makes Veracruz the most lethal state for journalists out of Mexico's 31 states and its federal district. Relations between the Veracruz governor and the media have been tense. In July, Governor Duarte accused some journalists of having criminal ties. He went on to warn them to \\"behave\\", arguing that if anything were to happen to them, it would be him who would be \\"crucified\\". Some local journalists saw this as a thinly veiled threat against them. Human rights investigator Patrick Timmons says that while Veracruz may currently be the most risky place for journalists in Mexico, other states are not immune from violence against the media. \\"We have to understand that what we're seeing in Veracruz has happened in other states and it will happen in other states too,\\" he warns. Mexican authorities investigating the multiple murder said they were keeping all lines of investigation open, including robbery. But friends and relatives of Mr Espinosa think he was deliberately targeted, pointing to the execution-style nature of the killing. All five victims were shot in the head. Mr Espinosa's body showed signs of torture and three of the four women were raped. So far, one suspect has been arrested. Investigators said his fingerprints had been found at the crime scene and matched to a database which showed he had a criminal record for rape and assault. But Emily Edmonds-Poli, associate professor of political science at the University of San Diego and author of a paper on violence against journalists in Mexico, is sceptical. \\"That's so old-hat in Mexico, you pick up the nearest criminal and you accuse them of the crime,\\" she said. \\"I don't believe anyone is fooled by that,\\" she added, Many of the journalists killed in Mexico reported on organised crime and drug trafficking, considered inherently risky beats. But Prof Edmonds-Poli thinks their killings should not be dismissed that easily. \\"Many of them have covered corruption beats or politics, they are not necessarily chasing ambulances and trying to report on cartel activities,\\" she argues. She says that \\"it's the nexus between drug-trafficking organisations and the government, and that's why this really isn't solely a drug-related issue\\". \\"It's about how the state deals with being exposed,\\" she adds. The fact that Mr Espinosa was killed in Mexico City after having fled Veracruz, where he had received death threats, is seen by many as a dark development. Mexico City had for several years been seen as a safe haven, a bubble for journalists. But that bubble has now burst. Free speech group Article 19 argues that Mr Espinosa's murder marks a new level of violence against journalists in Mexico. \\"If you get pursued into Mexico City, that shows another level of determination on the part of people who are interested in silencing journalists,\\" said Emily Edmonds-Poli. Ruben Espinosa's murder shows that it is no longer true that in Mexico City \\"no pasa nada\\". Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"In Mexico, many journalists are getting hurt or killed because they are reporting on dangerous topics like crime and corrupt politicians. The situation is really bad in a place called Veracruz. Recently, a journalist named Ruben Espinosa was killed in Mexico City, along with four women. People are worried that this crime will not be solved, just like many other crimes in Mexico. This makes it very scary for journalists who want to report the truth.

Q: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

A lawmaker from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party has described rape as a social crime, saying 'sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong.' The latest controversial remarks by an Indian politician about rape came as political leaders of Uttar Pradesh, the state where two cousins aged 12 and 14 were raped and hanged last week, have faced criticism for failing to visit the scene and for accusing the media of hyping the story. A regional politician from Modi's own party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said on Thursday that the crime of rape can only be considered to have been committed if it is reported to police. The BJP dismissed OPTIONS: - BJP's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Babulal Gaur's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Bharatiya Janata Party's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Indian's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Modi's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Narendra Modi's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Uttar Pradesh's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's.","completion":"Correct answer: - Babulal Gaur's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. Explanation: Based on the context given, it can be inferred that the person making controversial remarks about rape is a lawmaker from Prime Minister Modi's party, BJP. There's no mention of the lawmaker's name being directly referred to as \\"BJP,\\" \\"Bharatiya Janata Party,\\" \\"Indian,\\" \\"Modi,\\" \\"Narendra Modi,\\" \\"Uttar Pradesh\\". Therefore, these options are incorrect. The choice that fits best in this context is Babulal Gaur. The reason other answers are wrong is that they are not the names of the lawmaker in question and the comments are not attributed directly to BJP, Bharatiya Janata Party, Modi, Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh, or India. So the statements attributing the comments to these entities or individuals are incorrect. Based on logical inference and elimination, Babulal Gaur must be the name of the regional politician from BJP who made the controversial remarks about rape, and so the correct option is distinguished as Babulal Gaur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ev eğitimi, öğrencilere düzenli bir okul ortamında öğretilen derslerin yanı sıra, aile değerleri, kültür ve etik konularında da eğitim sağlar. Bu nedenle, bazı insanlar ev eğitiminin geleneksel eğitim sistemine kıyasla daha fazla avantaja sahip olduğunu düşünmektedir. Ev eğitimi, öğrencilere birçok yönden fayda sağlar. Öncelikle, özelleştirilmiş bir öğrenme deneyimi sunar. Evde öğrenen çocuklar, kendi hızlarında çalışarak ve ilgi alanlarına odaklanarak bilgiyi daha etkin bir şekilde özümseyebilirler. Bu, onların okul dışındaki yaşamlarına da olumlu bir etki yapabilir. Ayrıca, ev eğitimi çocuklara daha fazla teşvik ve destek sunar. Anne ve babalar, çocuklarının güçlü ve zayıf yönlerini bildiklerinden, onlara daha iyi eğitim ve öğretim sunarak akademik başarılarını artırabilirler. Bu, çocukların daha özgüvenli, bağımsız ve kendine yeterli bireyler haline gelmelerine yardımcı olur. Ev eğitimi, aynı zamanda öğrencilere eğitimde süreklilik ve istikrar sağlar. Evde eğitim gören çocuklar, özellikle de düşük gelirli ailelere sahip olanlar, okul değişikliklerinden ve kesintilerden daha az etkilenir. Bu sağlamlık ve istikrar, onların akademik başarılarına ve genel yaşam başarılarına da yansır. Ancak, ev eğitiminin de bazı dezavantajları vardır. İlk olarak, sosyal becerilerin gelişimi ev eğitimiyle sınırlıdır. Okul ortamında, öğrenciler sınıf arkadaşları ve öğretmenlerle etkileşime girerek sosyal yeteneklerini geliştirirler. Evde öğrenen çocuklar, bu tür sosyal etkileşimlerden mahrum kalabilirler. Bu, onların işbirliği, iletişim ve problem çözme becerilerini etkileyebilir ve genel yaşam başarılarını olumsuz yönde etkileyebilir. Buna ek olarak, evde eğitim alacak nitelikte bir öğretmenin bulunması her zaman mümkün olmayabilir. Kaliteli eğitimi sağlayacak kaynak ve deneyime sahip olan yetişkinlerin bulunması, özellikle uzmanlık gerektiren konularda zor olabilir. Bu durum, ev eğitiminin akademik başarısını sınırlayabilir. Sonuç olarak, ev eğitimi öğrencilere çeşitli avantajlar sunar, ancak sosyal becerilerin gelişimi ve öğretmen kalitesi gibi bazı dezavantajları da vardır. Aileler bu faktörleri göz önünde bulundurarak, ev eğitimi ve geleneksel eğitim arasında en uygun seçeneği belirleyebilirler."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The Village Voice obtained a copy of MTV's standard contract for The Real World, a 30-page document that essentially requires cast members to sign their lives away, quite literally—the first stipulation being the understanding that participating in this reality show could cause death, loss of limbs, or mental illness. Hundreds of cast members have agreed to these terms in the past 25 seasons of the show. While some of the terms in the contract may seem outlandish, they're there for good reason. Because one time a guy did almost die. In 2010, during the D.C. season, cast member Andrew Woods was pushed off a two-story balcony by one of his drunk roommates, landing on a concrete slab. And there are many more examples of \\"mental illness\\" or \\"extreme emotional distress\\" in the form of nervous breakdowns. During the 2006/2007 season of Denver, Brooke LaBarbera became a staple of on The Soup for her numerous meltdowns caused by the stress of her living conditions. This also ties into another contract stipulation: [Portrayal of cast members] may be disparaging, defamatory, embarrassing, [causing exposure to] public ridicule, humiliation or condemnation…[Cast members] may be portrayed in a false light. While also signing off on any objections to \\"a serious invasion of privacy,\\" Cara Kahn, part of 2002's Chicago cast, learned exactly what this meant the hard way, after watching herself have sex with several different men on television. It was the first time that Real World producers had used night vision cameras in the bedrooms and hidden microphones in the headboards of the beds, enabling them to pick up the audio of Cara opening a condom wrapper. The cast were unaware of this new development in production until the show aired, and Kahn later admitted to being humiliated by her portrayal as a \\"slut.\\" As for being portrayed in a \\"false light,\\" in 1998, Irene McGee, part of the Seattle cast, left the show and her departure was depicted as having to do with a relapse of her Lyme Disease, but footage of McGee was also edited to make it appear that she was losing her mind. After the show aired, McGee spoke out that she'd really left the show for \\"ethical objections to the production,\\" and went on to give lectures about the falseness of reality TV, speaking out against The Real World and divulging industry secrets. She was sued by MTV. Advertisement McGee's legal dealings with MTV and her telling tales out of school no doubt contributed to another contract stipulation that requires cast members to participate in all producer-determined press and are required to abstain from engaging in any other media (radio, TV, blogs, chat rooms, message boards) without the producers' written permission. Additionally, if cast members are found to have violated any of the stipulations of the contract, they are required to pay producers 1 million. Given the impact that AIDS activist Pedro Zamora had during the 1994 season in San Francisco, it's interesting that cast members are no longer allowed to participate in the show if they have any STDs and are required to sign a statement saying they don't. However, the contract also states that the other roommates might have STDs and that MTV is not responsible if you contract anything like AIDS \\"gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Chlamydia, scabies (crabs), hepatitis, genital warts, and other communicable and sexually transmitted diseases or Pregnancy; etc.\\" from a roommate while living in the house. (In 2004, during the Philadelphia season, Melanie Silcott contracted scabies while living in the house.) If you were wondering why nobody on The Real World has dealt with an unwanted pregnancy since Tami in the 1993 Los Angeles season—particularly considering MTV's boner for young moms and teen pregnancy—it's because cast members are not allowed to be pregnant. Pregnancy is grounds for dismissal. Advertisement Safety in The Real World house is also not a guarantee. Aside from the dangers of dying or contracting AIDS, the producers are under no obligation to conduct background checks on any of the roommates—meaning a participant could live with a violent criminal—and cast members are required to understand that they might have to deal with \\"non-consensual physical contact, of which MTV is not responsible. So basically, if you are raped or murdered by a fellow cast member, it's really on you. During the filming of the 2004 season of San Diego, a 22-year-old woman claimed she was raped in the house, by a guest of one of the roommates, after being roofied. Apparently, the production staff found the woman lying naked on the bathroom floor. One cast member said she heard the accused rapist of walking out of the bathroom saying, \\"I just hit that.\\" The cameras were rolling when the woman woke up, and one of the female roommates in the house informed her that she may have been sexually assaulted. The woman went to the police the next day, who began an investigation. However, the cast and crew had already left for Mexico, where they were filming their \\"vacation.\\" A producer of the show did allow police into the home for a search, and provided them with the consent forms and IDs of guests in the house. A lawyer for Bunim/Murray stepped in and refused to let the cops search the bedrooms. The police, most likely pissed off, returned with a search warrant and seized all bedding, editing equipment, and tapes from the time of the alleged crime. The result was that nearly a month of footage ended up on the cutting room floor because it wasn't returned in time, including the cast's Mexican vacation footage. No arrests were ever made in that case. Some other contract stipulations worth noting: You can't change your physical appearance during filming without the producers' permission. (So did Rachel need to get a note, for the 1994 San Francisco show, when she got a tattoo?) Producers can misrepresent cast members' life stories. Producers can have access to cast members' school records and credit history. Production can show up at cast members' personal homes at any time to film or remove any possessions from those homes as long as they return said possessions once production has ended. Cast members are obligated to participate in a reunion special for up to five years after the show ends. (This might stem from Aaron's and Dominic's refusal to participate in any reunion shows after they finished filming the Los Angeles season in 1993.) Cast members are responsible for the cost of all long-distance phone calls during filming and must reimburse producers. We Have Obtained a Copy of MTV's Standard Real World Cast-Member Contract [VV] ||||| Last Wednesday's Village Voice cover story profiled the DeBartoli sisters, two Staten Island sisters who starred in the never-aired Jersey Shore precursor Bridge & Tunnel and signed enormously binding contracts, legal documents that seemed to be written in another language but that they accepted anyway. This is standard practice for all its reality-show subjects, and though the following is a different document than the one the B&T; girls inked, we've managed to get our hands on an unsigned Real World contract. The 30-page spectacular is worth careful scrutiny, but please enjoy the amusingly specific highlights we've summarized below. Happy birthday, MTV! Under the stipulations of the following standard contract, participants in Real World--the grandaddy of \\"reality\\" shows, after Cops--agree to the following terms: • You may die, lose limbs, and suffer nervous breakdowns. (Stipulation 1) • If you undergo any medical procedures while involved in the show, they carry the risk of infection, disfigurement, death. (4) • You may be humiliated and explicitly portrayed \\"in a false light.\\" (12) • Producers are under no obligation to conduct background checks on your fellow cast members. (7) • If you contract AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases while filming [\\"gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Chlamydia, scabies (crabs),'hepatitis, genital warts, and other communicable and sexually transmitted diseases or Pregnancy; etc\\"], MTV is not responsible. (7) • Interacting with other cast members carries the risk of \\"non-consensual physical contact\\" and should you contract AIDS, etc. during such an interaction, MTV is not responsible. (7) • You don't have STDs, but accept that other people on the show might. (18) • You're not pregnant and you won't become pregnant before the show's done filming. If you do become pregnant, you'll tell the Producer immediately--and pregnancy is grounds for dismissal. (38) • If you get kicked off the show, it will be filmed. (14) • You can't change your physical appearance during filming, without the Producer's express permission. (26) • You grant the Producer blanket rights to your life story. (49) • The Producer can do pretty much anything they want with your life story, including misrepresent it. (49) • Your email may be monitored during participation. (20b) • You promise not to hide from MTV cameras in establishments where they can't film. (20a) • You authorize the Producer to have total access to your school records, government forms, your credit history. (19) • The production crew can show up at your personal house at any time to film and/or to take anything they want, as long as they return the objects once production has ended. (20a) • Under ordinary circumstances, all of this would be considered a \\"serious\\" invasion of privacy. (11) • For one year after the show's final episode airs, cast members are required to participate in all producer-determined press and forbidden from engaging in any media (radio, television, chat rooms, blogs) without the Producer's written permission. (9) • The Producer holds the authorship and copyright to every photograph, email, website, sound or video recording, documented performance created in relation to the program, on every medium imaginable. (8) • You're obligated to participate in a Reunion Special for up to five years after the show ends, you'll be paid 2500 for your involvement, and the Producer only has to give you 14 days notice. (50c) • You're required to participate in book or home video projects for two years after the show ends, and you'll be paid 750.00 for each one. (50f) Also, worth noting: • While you're on the show, you're responsible for all long-distance phone charges. (16a) • The explicit list of physical tasks you might be subjected to, enumerated in the contract, include traveling by \\"air (whether via helicopter, commercial airliner, glider, private aircraft or otherwise), train and/or automobile, as well as strenuous and/or dangerous and/or mental activity, including but not limited to, horseback riding, jogging, bicycling, motorcycling, exercise and/or weight equipment, skydiving, swimming, bungee jumping, parasailing snorkeling, jet skiing, amusement park activities, rock climbing, engaging in contact sports, hiking, kayaking and boating.\\" (1) There's a lot more where that came from.

A security company hired by the network tells Google that the hackers stole \\"thousands of ... internal company documents\\" belonging to HBO as well as \\"masses of copyrighted items including documents, images, videos and sound,\\" Variety reports. The company, IP Echelon, is in the process of removing search results for the hacked files, and the revelation came as part of a take-down notice sent to Google ordering it to remove links to the leaked files. Sources tell the Hollywood Reporter as many as 1.5 terabytes of data could have been exposed by the breach, which would make the hack worse than the 2014 Sony hack. So far, episodes of Ballers, Insecure, Room 104, and Barry (the last of which has not aired yet) have been released by the hackers; they claim to also have at least one Game of Thrones script. The personal information of a senior HBO executive, including access to online banking and other online accounts, also appears to have been leaked. Other employee data and possibly even customer data is potentially vulnerable, leading Variety to also compare the attack to the Sony hack. Hackers have not asked for any ransom yet.

The TV network hired IP Echelon, a security company, to remove search results of the hacked content. IP Echelon later reported that hackers stole thousands of internal company documents belonging to HBO, along with masses of copyrighted items such as documents, images, videos, and sound. The security company was part of a take-down order sent to Google, instructing them to remove links to the leaked files. As many as 1.5 terabytes of data could have been exposed in this cyberattack, which would make the situation worse than the notorious 2014 Sony hack involving a reported 100 terabytes of data. So far, the HBO hackers have released episodes of Ballers, Insecure, Room 104, and Barry (which has not yet aired). In addition to this, they claim to be in possession of at least one Game of Thrones script. In the attack, the personal information of a senior HBO executive—including access to online banking and other online accounts—also appears to have been leaked. There is the potential that other employee data and even customer data could be vulnerable. This massive data breach has led some, such as Variety, to draw comparisons between the HBO attack and the Sony hack. To date, the hackers have not demanded any ransom. HBO CEO Richard Plepler assured employees on August 2nd, 2017, that it was unlikely the hackers had breached the entire email system. The HBO cyberattack raises concerns over data security within the entertainment industry, as cybercriminals continue to target high-profile networks and their intellectual property.

The story is told by Keira St. George, a girl who is trying to decide what to do with her life. She constantly throws away her college letter without reading it, but her father always retrieves it, annoying her more. Her two best friends are Glory Lorraine a beautiful but somewhat bitchy girl obsessed with marriage, and Lisa MacDougall, an awkward, born-again, religious girl who is obsessed with sex. Glory babysits for Keith Clark and his wife, who works the night shift four times a week. Keith is a 32-year-old husband and father, who loves to ride his motorcycle, gamble with friends and smoke pot. One afternoon, Keira talks to Gordon Gruber, who is a bit slow, trying to get information from him about Keith, who has taken Gruber under his wing. Gruber tells Keira about the pot growing in Keith's backyard. That night, Keira and Lisa decide to take some of Keith's pot. While leaving, they hear what sounds like Keith and his wife having sex. Sex crazed Lisa decides to take a closer look. When Kiera joins her, the two discover that Keith isn't with his wife but with Glory! Later that night, Glory arrives at the bonfire.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the last year Boult taught at the Royal College of Music? ? Boult, unlike many of his contemporaries, preferred the traditional orchestral layout, with first violins on the conductor's left and the seconds on the right. Of the practice of grouping all the violins together on the left, he wrote, \\"The new seating is, I admit, easier for the conductor and the second violins, but I firmly maintain that the second violins themselves sound far better on the right. ... When the new fashion reached us from America somewhere about 1908 it was adopted by some conductors, but Richter, Weingartner, Walter, Toscanini and many others kept what I feel is the right balance.\\"This care for balance was an important feature of Boult's music-making. Orchestral players across decades commented on his insistence that every important part should be heard without difficulty. His BBC principal violist wrote in 1938, \\"If a woodwind player has to complain that he has already been blowing 'fit to burst' there is trouble for somebody.\\" The trombonist Ray Premru wrote forty years later, \\"One of the old school, like Boult, is so refreshing because he will reduce the dynamic level – 'No, no, pianissimo, strings, let the soloist through, less from everyone else.' That is the old idea of balance.\\"As an educator, Boult influenced several generations of musicians, beginning with his conducting class at the Royal College of Music, London, which he ran from 1919 to 1930. As no such classes had been held before in Britain, Boult \\"created its curriculum from out of his own experience. ... From that first small class has come all the later formal training for conductors throughout Britain.\\" In the 1930s Boult ran a series of \\"conferences for conductors\\" at his country house near Guildford, sometimes helped by Vaughan Williams who lived a few miles away. From 1962 to 1966 he again taught at the Royal College of Music. In later life, he made time for young conductors who sought his counsel. Among those who studied with or were influenced by Boult were Colin Davis, James Loughran, Richard Hickox and Vernon...

Please write a short summary for the following article: United Airlines will honour flight tickets mistakenly sold for 5 to 10 Customers rushed to book 10 United Airlines flights to destinations including Hawaii and Las Vegas. Photo: Toru Hanai/Reuters United Airlines will honour plane tickets it mistakenly sold online for between 5 and 10, the company said on Friday. Customers using the airline's website were able to book tickets without paying airline fares – just airport and security fees – for a brief time on Thursday due to a human error, United confirmed. The mistake saw some customers quickly book discount flights to high-desirability locations including Hawaii and Las Vegas. United rectified the problem on Thursday but said it would honour the sales. \\"We've reviewed the error that occurred yesterday and based on these specific circumstances, we will honor the tickets,\\" the company tweeted on Friday afternoon. United said it had accidentally filed some fares for 0, due to a human error. It did not reveal how many tickets were sold at erroneous prices. It shut down its website entirely on Thursday afternoon before reopening at around 2.45pm, according to reports. The discount flights were no longer available when the site came back online. Andy Farrimond, a software consultant from Washington DC, told CNN Money that he discovered the error as he booked a business trip to Minneapolis. Farrimond alerted a number of co-workers to his discovery, he said. His colleagues spent the next hour booking personal trips to the West Coast and Hawaii, CNN Monday reported. \\"It was pandemonium in the office for a while yesterday,\\" Farrimond said. He came away from the United website having booked trips with his wife to Honolulu, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Jose. His co-workers had booked flights to Las Vegas and other popular vacation destinations. Bob Stokas, from Chicago, told NBC that he had stumbled across the cheap flights while searching for a round-trip ticket to LA next June. He had been expecting to pay up to 400 per ticket when he noticed the cheap fares. \\"When I scrolled down past the non-stop fares, when I got to the connecting flights, the flights to and from Los Angeles per person was 10,\\" Stokas told NBC. \\"That was a shock and a surprise, and I was like, 'I've got to book this flight right now before they rescind their offer of 10 for this flight.'\\" Stokas bought six tickets for 60. He said he returned to United's website to buy tickets for a trip to Roanoke, Virginia, this weekend, but found the website to be offline.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that created the Oviri ceramic? , can you please find it? Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money. Art historian Christopher Gray mentions three...

Step 2: Consider the rabbit's perspective It's important to think about how the rabbit might have felt during this experience. Rabbits are often naturally timid and skittish animals, so being at a vet's office and having a human poking and examining them can be a stressful experience. Step 3: Evaluate the potential reasons for the rabbit's reaction In light of the rabbit's perspective, there are a few possible reasons why your rabbit tried to escape: a) Discomfort: The examination near the rabbit's rear end might have been uncomfortable for your pet, as it is a sensitive area. b) Fear: Your rabbit could have been scared as it was being held by a stranger (the vet) in an unfamiliar environment (the vet's office) and subjected to an unusual experience (poking and examination). c) Stress: The combined factors of being in an unfamiliar place and being handled by a stranger could have caused your rabbit to feel stressed, making it more likely to attempt to escape. Step 4: Determine the most probable reason Based on the information provided and considering the rabbit's perspective, it seems likely that your pet was trying to escape due to a combination of discomfort, fear, and stress.

Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Kentucky Supreme Court was created by a 1975 constitutional amendment and is the state supreme court of the U.S. state of Kentucky. Prior to that the Kentucky Court of Appeals was the only appellate court in Kentucky. The Kentucky Court of Appeals is now Kentucky's intermediate appellate court. - The Kentucky House of Representatives is the lower house of the Kentucky General Assembly. It is composed of 100 Representatives elected from single-member districts throughout the Commonwealth. Not more than two counties can be joined to form a House district, except when necessary to preserve the principle of equal representation.

The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. - The Kentucky General Assembly, also called the Kentucky Legislature, is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Kentucky. - An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court, court of appeals (American English), appeal court (British English), court of second instance or second instance court, is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal. In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court. Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules. - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States.

In 1810 , he was appointed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , where he served for two years before resigning to pursue a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives . He served two terms in that body , resigning in 1816 . Clark accepted an appointment to the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817 . It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred . In 1822 , he struck down a debt relief law in the case of Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts . His decision was unpopular with the legislature , who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it . An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two - thirds majority . The following year , the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark 's ruling . In retaliation , the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views . This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court - New Court controversy . In 1825 , Clark was chosen to fill the congressional seat vacated by Henry Clay 's elevation to Secretary of State . He served until 1831 , but did not seek re-election that year .

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Menachem Begin ( listen ; Hebrew: m@nakhem be'giyn Menahem Begin, Polish: Mieczyslaw Biegun; Russian: Menakhem Vol'fovich Begin Menakhem Volfovich Begin; 16 August 1913 - 9 March 1992) was an Israeli politician, founder of Likud and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel. On 17 May 1977 the Likud, headed by Begin, won the Knesset elections by a landslide, becoming the biggest party in the Knesset. Popularly known as the Mahapakh (\\"upheaval\\"), the election results had seismic ramifications as for the first time in Israeli history a party other than the Alignment/Mapai was in a position to form a government, effectively ending the left's hitherto unrivalled domination over Israeli politics. Likud's electoral victory signified a fundamental restructuring of Israeli society in which the founding socialist Ashkenazi elite was being replaced by a coalition representing marginalized Mizrahi and Jewish-religious communities, promoting a socially conservative and economically liberal agenda. The Likud campaign leading up to the election centered on Begin's personality. Demonized by the Alignment as totalitarian and extremist, his self-portrayal as a humble and pious leader struck a chord with many who felt abandoned by the ruling party's ideology. In the predominantly Jewish Mizrahi working class urban neighborhoods and peripheral towns, the Likud won overwhelming majorities, while disillusionment with the Alignment's corruption prompted many middle and upper class voters to support the newly founded centrist Democratic Movement for Change (\\"Dash\\") headed by Yigael Yadin. Dash won 15 seats out of 120, largely at the expense of the Alignment, which was led by Shimon Peres and had shrunk from 51 to 32 seats. Well aware of his momentous achievement and employing his trademark sense for drama, when speaking that night in the Likud headquarters Begin quoted from the Gettysburg Address and the Torah, referring to his victory as a 'turning point in the history of the Jewish people'. With 43 seats, the Likud still required the support of other parties in order to reach a parliamentary majority that would enable it to form a government under Israel's proportionate representation parliamentary system. Though able to form a narrow coalition with smaller Jewish religious and ultra-orthodox parties, Begin also sought support from centrist elements in the Knesset to provide his government with greater public legitimacy. He controversially offered the foreign affairs portfolio to Moshe Dayan, a former IDF Chief of Staff and Defense Minister, and a prominent Alignment politician identified with the old establishment. Begin was sworn in as Prime Minister of Israel on 20 June 1977. Dash eventually joined his government several months later, thus providing it with the broad support of almost two thirds of the Knesset. While Prime Minister, Yehuda Avner served as Begin's speech writer.","completion":"This text is about Menachem Begin, who was an Israeli politician, founder of Likud, and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: China is building massive databases of Americans’ personal information by hacking government agencies and U.S. health-care companies, using a high-tech tactic to achieve an age-old goal of espionage: recruiting spies or gaining more information on an adversary, U.S. officials and analysts say. Groups of hackers working for the Chinese government have compromised the networks of the Office of Personnel Management, which holds data on millions of current and former federal employees, as well as the health insurance giant Anthem, among other targets, the officials and researchers said. “They’re definitely going after quite a bit of personnel information,” said Rich Barger, chief intelligence officer of ThreatConnect, a Northern Virginia cybersecurity firm. “We suspect they’re using it to understand more about who to target [for espionage], whether electronically or via human ­recruitment.” [How the Internet became so vulnerable] The targeting of large-scale data­bases is a relatively new tactic and is used by the Chinese government to further its ­intelligence-gathering, the officials and analysts say. It is government espionage, not commercial espionage, they say. China hacked into the federal government’s network, compromising four million current and former employees' information. The Post's Ellen Nakashima talks about what kind of national security risk this poses and why China wants this information. (Alice Li/The Washington Post) “This is part of their strategic goal — to increase their intelligence collection via big-data theft and big-data aggregation,” said a U.S. government official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. “It’s part of a strategic plan.” One hack of OPM, which was disclosed by the government Thursday, dates at least to December, officials said. Earlier last year, OPM discovered a separate intrusion into a highly sensitive database that contains information on employees seeking or renewing security clearances and on their background investigations. Once harvested, the data can be used to glean details about key government personnel and potential spy recruits, or to gain information useful for counter­intelligence. Records in OPM’s database of background investigations, for instance, could contain a complete history of where an individual has lived and all of his or her foreign contacts in, say, China. “So now the Chinese counterintelligence authorities know which American officials are meeting with which Chinese,” a China cyber and intelligence expert said. The data could help Chinese analysts do more effective targeting of individuals, said a former National Security Agency official. “They can find specific individuals they want to go after, family members,” he said. The trend has emerged and accelerated over the past 12 to 18 months, the official said. An increase in Chinese capability has opened the way “for bigger data storage, for bigger data theft,” he said. “And when you can gain it in bulk, you take it in bulk.” The Chinese government, he said, is making use of Chinese companies that specialize in aggregating large sets of data “to help them in sifting through” the information for useful details. “The analogy would be one of our intelligence organizations using Google, Yahoo, Accenture to aggregate data that we collected.” China on Friday dismissed the allegation of hacking as “irresponsible and unscientific.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Beijing wanted to cooperate with other nations to build a peaceful and secure cyberspace. “We wish the United States would not be full of suspicions, catching wind and shadows, but rather have a larger measure of trust and cooperation,” he told a regular news briefing, OPM disclosed that the latest hack of one of its systems exposed personal data of up to 4 million current and former employees — the largest hack of federal employee data in recent years. It is possible that officials as senior as Cabinet secretaries had their data exposed, a congressional aide said on a briefing call with government officials Friday. U.S. officials privately said China was behind it. The stolen information included Social Security numbers and performance evaluations. [What to do if you are a federal worker] “This is an intelligence operation designed to help the Chinese government,” the China expert said. “It’s a new phase in an evolution of what they’re doing. It certainly requires greater sophistication on their part in terms of being able to take out this much data.” Barger’s firm has turned up technical evidence that the same Chinese group is behind the hacks of Premera Blue Cross and Empire BlueCross, which were discovered at roughly the same time earlier this year. The first OPM incident has been linked to the health-care hacks by Barger and another security researcher, John Hultquist, senior manager for cyberespionage threat intelligence at iSight Partners. Hultquist said the same group is responsible for all of them, and for other intrusions into commercial databases containing large sets of Americans’ personal information. “They would leverage this data to get to diplomatic, political, military and economic intelligence that they typically target,” said Hultquist, who declined to comment on who was behind the attacks. Though much Chinese cyber­espionage is attributed to the People’s Liberation Army, these hacks, Barger said, appeared to be linked to the Ministry of State Security, which is a spy agency responsible for foreign espionage and domestic counterintelligence. Other Chinese entities, including the military, may also be involved in the campaign, analysts said. Chinese government hackers “are like a vacuum cleaner” in sucking up information electronically, said Robert “Bear” Bryant, a former top counterespionage official in the government. “They’re becoming much more sophisticated in tying it all together. And they’re trying to harm us.” [Why the Internet’s massive flaws never get fixed] Security researchers have pointed to a cyber tool or family of malicious software called Derusbi that has been linked exclusively to Chinese actors. One group that has used Derusbi is Deep Panda, a name coined by the firm CrowdStrike, which has linked that group to the Anthem hack. Disclosed in February, that incident exposed the Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and member IDs of tens of millions of customers. No medical data such as diagnosis or treatment information was compromised, the company said. Researchers note that in contrast to the hacks of Home Depot and Target, personal data that might have been stolen from OPM, Anthem and the other companies has not shown up on the black market, where it can be sold to identity thieves. That is another sign, they said, that the intrusions are not being made for commercial purposes. “Usually if there’s a criminally or financially motivated breach like that, we see the data making its way into the black market soon after that,” Barger said. The big-data approach being taken by the Chinese might seem to mirror techniques used abroad by the NSA, which has come under scrutiny for its data-gathering practices under executive authority. But in China, the authorities do not tolerate public debate over the proper limits of large-scale spying in the digital age. “This is what all intelligence services do if they’re good,” said the China cyber expert. “If you want to find a needle, first you have to gather a haystack of needles.” The massive data harvesting “reflects a maturity in Chinese” electronic intelligence gathering, the expert said. “You have to put in place structured data repositories. You have to have big-data management tools to be able to store and sift and analyze.” Barger said that “with a large pool of data, they can prioritize who is the best to target electronically and who is the best to target via human recruitment.” The U.S. official noted that the Chinese “would not take [the data] if they did not have the opportunity to aggregate it.” And, he added, “they are taking it.” Simon Denyer in Beijing contributed to this report. ||||| The U.S. suspects that Chinese hackers stole the personal records of four million people, the latest in a series of cyberspying accusations the two countries have lobbed at each other.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Etty had planned for a burial in York Minster, but neglected to cover the necessary costs in his will. With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 \\"It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\".Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87. While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style. Holman Hunt recollected that \\"in my youth [Etty] had lost the robustness he once had [...] the paintings of his advanced age cloyed the taste by their...

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Gluing leather to the cover inserts","completion":"To glue leather to cover inserts, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Gather the materials: First, you'll need to have all the necessary materials. This includes the leather, cover inserts (such as cardboard or other material), glue specifically designed for leather (e.g. contact cement or leather glue), a brush, scissors, a ruler, a pen or pencil, and a clean cloth. 2. Measure and cut the leather: Measure the size of your cover inserts and add an extra margin for the edges – typically around 1/2 to 1 inch. Mark these dimensions on the backside of the leather using a pen or pencil, and then cut the leather to size using the scissors. 3. Prepare the surfaces: Clean both the leather and the cover insert surfaces to ensure they are free from dust or debris. Wipe down the surfaces with a clean cloth, if needed, to remove any lingering contaminants. 4. Apply the glue: Using a brush, apply a thin, even layer of glue on both the leather and the cover insert. Be sure to cover the entire surfaces, including the edges. When using contact cement, allow each surface to dry until the glue becomes tacky, but not wet – this usually takes around 15 minutes. For other types of leather glue, read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying time. 5. Position the leather: Carefully align the leather piece with the cover insert, ensuring that the edges match up and taking into consideration any extra margin needed for folding or trimming. Starting from the center and working outwards, press the leather onto the cover insert firmly, so the adhesive bonds to both surfaces. 6. Secure the edges: To create a professional finish, fold and glue the edges of the leather to the backside of the cover insert. Apply additional glue if needed to ensure a secure bond. Use a clean cloth or your fingers to press the leather down, ensuring a tight fit and removing any air bubbles. 7. Let it dry: Allow the glued surfaces to dry thoroughly. Depending on the type of glue used, this may take between 1 to 24 hours. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for optimal drying time. 8. Clean up: Once the glue is completely dry, clean up any excess glue or residue with a damp cloth. Be cautious not to get the leather too wet, as this could damage the finish. 9. Inspect and finish: Check your work for any imperfections, such as air bubbles or uneven edges. If needed, you can carefully trim the edges of the leather with a sharp knife to achieve a clean, professional look. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully glue leather to the cover inserts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this article and answer this question Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan , was an Irish Jacobite and soldier, belonging to an Anglo-Norman family long settled in Ireland. Sarsfield gained his first military experience serving with an Anglo-Irish contingent of the French Army during the 1670s. When James II came to the throne he was commissioned in the English Army, and served during the suppression of Monmouth's Rebellion in 1685. During the Glorious Revolution of 1688 he remained loyal to James and led an English cavalry detachment at the Battle of Wincanton, the only military engagement of the campaign. In 1689 Sarsfield accompanied James to Ireland and served in the Jacobite Irish Army. After an early setback at Sligo, he became one of the celebrated Jacobite leaders of the war, noted in particular for Sarsfield's Raid shortly before the Siege of Limerick in 1690. James rewarded him by making him an Earl in the Peerage of Ireland. After the war's end following a second siege of Limerick in 1691, he led the Flight of the Wild Geese which took thousands of Irish soldiers into exile in France where they continued to serve James. After a planned invasion of England had to be abandoned following a French naval defeat in 1692, Lord Lucan served in Flanders and was killed at the Battle of Landen in 1693.

She took her professional pseudonym from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and the musician Clarence Holiday, her probable father. At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \\"Halliday\\", the birth surname of her father, but eventually changed it to \\"Holiday\\", his performing name. The young singer teamed up with a neighbor, the tenor saxophone player Kenneth Hollan. From 1929 to 1931, they were a team, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, Pod's and Jerry's on 133rd Street, and the Brooklyn Elks' Club. Benny Goodman recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at the Bright Spot. As her reputation grew, she played in many clubs, including Mexico's and the Alhambra Bar and Grill, where she met Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with Chick Webb. It was also during this period that she connected with her father, who was playing in Fletcher Henderson's band. Late in 1932, at the age of 17, Holiday replaced the singer Monette Moore at Covan's, a club on West 132nd Street. The producer John Hammond, who loved Moore's singing and had come to hear her, first heard Holiday there in early 1933. Hammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut, at age 18, in November 1933, with Benny Goodman. She recorded two songs: \\"Your Mother's Son-in-Law\\" and \\"Riffin' the Scotch\\", the latter being her first hit. \\"Son-in-Law\\" sold 300 copies, but \\"Riffin' the Scotch\\", released on November 11, sold 5,000 copies. Hammond was impressed by Holiday's singing style and said of her, \\"Her singing almost changed my music tastes and my musical life, because she was the first girl singer I'd come across who actually sang like an improvising jazz genius.\\" Hammond compared Holiday favorably to Armstrong and said she had a good sense of lyric content at her young age. In 1935, Holiday had a small role as a woman abused by her lover in Duke Ellington's short Symphony in Black: A Rhapsody of Negro Life. In her scene, she sang \\"Saddest Tale\\".

Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they overcome the monsters, but as they reach the gates of the palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock in the midst of a stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight. In the palace garden Armida prepares to kill Almirena. Rinaldo draws his sword, but Armida is protected from his wrath by spirits.

Math problem: Solve 9*s = 8*s + 5 for s. What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the given equation 9*s = 8*s + 5 for s, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable (s) on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 8*s from both sides of the equation to eliminate s from the right side. 9*s - 8*s = 8*s - 8*s + 5 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have: (9 - 8)*s = 1*s On the right side, we have: 0 + 5 = 5 Now the equation becomes: 1*s = 5 Step 3: Solve for the variable (s). As we have 1*s on the left side, this means that the equation is already isolated, and we can find the value of s directly. 1*s = 5 To find the value of s, we will divide both sides of the equation by 1. s = 5 / 1 This simplifies to: s = 5 So, the solution to the equation 9*s = 8*s + 5 is s = 5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The coal mine is operated by a group of dedicated miners under the supervision of five exceptionally devoted supervisors. One fateful night, the town decides to throw a lively dance party, a long-held tradition of the townspeople to celebrate the onset of spring. As the people in town prepare for the festivities, miners continue working on a regular shift, unaware of the true extent of the revelry that awaits them above ground. The anticipation and excitement of the dance are contagious, and the coal mine supervisors find themselves grappling with their responsibility to the miners and their desire to partake in the celebration. As they initially try to maintain a balance, they eventually succumb to the enticing atmosphere and leave the mine in the hands of the Miners' Captain, a highly respected member of the workforce. With the supervisors away, one by one, the miners begin to hear the distant music and laughter from the party and decide to join the celebration while the Miners' Captain continues to work. The night is filled with alcohol, merriment, and, surprisingly, heartfelt connections - as townspeople mingle with the miners, building friendships and even sparking romances. However, the night takes a tragic turn when a dangerous explosion occurs in the coal mine. With only the Miners' Captain remaining in the mine, the town's tension reaches a breaking point, and the real question begins to emerge: how many supervisors had abandoned their duties, leaving the miners and the Captain in the hands of danger? As the story unravels, the truth gradually surfaces, unveiling how the disaster unfolded - from negligent supervisors to the miners' choices of disregarding safety precautions. As relationships develop and fractures occur among the town's people, the movie ultimately delves deep into themes of responsibility, loyalty, and the complex minefield of human desires. In the end, the town mourns the loss of their beloved Miners’ Captain while reflecting upon their values and priorities. The tragedy forces everyone to confront the power of choices and consequences, leaving the surviving supervisors to grapple with their guilt and remorse over prioritizing the dance over their duties in the mine. The Unseen Dance explores the intricate interplay between responsibility, temptation, and the consequences of the choices we make – all while shedding light on the importance of balancing work, community, and our personal desires."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After Keith Barker's breakthrough at 76-2, Ireland and England international Rankin then took three wickets in 24 balls to leave Notts on 125-6. The whole of the evening session was lost when the rain arrived at tea. Notts' only bright spot was opener Jake Libby, who lasted over three hours for a determinedly gritty 59. Both teams made one change from their last Championship match, in the pace bowling department. The Bears brought in Mark Adair for only his second Championship game in place of Oliver Hannon-Dalby, while Nottinghamshire's Luke Fletcher replaced Harry Gurney (bruised heel). After choosing to bat, Notts moved slowly in the morning session as the ball swung in humid conditions, and reached 71-2 at lunch from 32 overs. The impressively economical Rikki Clarke broke through in the ninth over when he hit Steve Mullaney's off-stump before Michael Lumb, having made just 10 in 62 minutes, misread spinner Jeetan Patel's arm-ball to be trapped lbw. After facing 117 balls to bat through the session for 37, Libby speeded up a little after lunch. But, after Brendan Taylor lofted a catch to long leg, Riki Wessels edged a brute of a ball from Rankin to wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose. Then, after seeing Samit Patel also get caught behind, Libby, who started this season on loan with Northamptonshire, became the third player to be caught by Ambrose off the bowling of Rankin. It earned the Irishman impressive figures of 3-25 from his 14 overs. Warwickshire fast bowler Boyd Rankin told BBC WM: \\"I'm pleased with how I bowled. I've been feeling pretty good in the last few weeks. I bowled pretty well against Lancashire but just didn't get wickets. \\"We kept them to two runs per over pretty much all the whole time. All the guys bowled well but it was just my day to take a few wickets. \\"The pitch is quite slow and it's not really doing much off the deck. It is a little bit tacky but hopefully it will flatten out a bit for when we come to bat.\\" Notts head coach Mick Newell told BBC Radio Nottingham: \\"I thought there'd be a bit more pace in the pitch. It was quite difficult to score off the medium quick bowlers, then Boyd Rankin stepped it up a little bit. \\"He was quicker than everybody else. He bowled a very good spell in the middle of the afternoon which put under some serious pressure. \\"Jake Libby batted very well. He started very well for Northants.

Sefton (William Holden) is a POW who has profitably wagered with his fellow American prisoners that these escapes would fail.The POWs fear there may be an informer in their midst, but who is it? As it becomes clearer and clearer to his fellow inmates that Sefton has considerable contact with his German captors, his fellow POWs mistakenly conclude that he is the informer and they turn on him, including physically beating him and helping themselves to some of his belongings.Sefton understands in full that to clear his name, he must determine the identity of the real informer, and he is, eventually, able to work out that Price (Peter Graves), whose English is impeccable, is a German informant masquerading as an American POW. Written messages, Sefton discovers, are being smuggled by Price to the Germans through a hollow chess piece on the chessboard in the barracks, wth phony air raid drills staged to enable the Germans to retrieve these messages undetected.Now realizing that Price has figured prominently in the death of the Americans that have attempted escape, Sefton plots revenge, and, after exposing Price's true identity to his fellow POWs, he maneuvers to force Price to make an unauthorized exit from the barracks. To the guards manning the tower, Price's exit looks like an American escape attempt, and they shoot him, much to the dismay of Stalag Commandant Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger).The diversion created by the shooting incident gives Sefton a chance to escape, and he takes with him a brave lieutenant (Don Taylor) who has recently been captured.

And I was wondering What will happen to Jordan? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it is not possible to predict the exact outcome of the situation for Jordan. However, given that Robin has expressed interest in Jordan and asked him out on a date, there are a few possible scenarios that may take place: 1. Jordan accepts Robin's date invitation: If Jordan is also interested in Robin, he might agree to go out on the date. In this case, both individuals would have the opportunity to get to know each other better and explore their potential for a romantic relationship. This could lead to the development of a strong connection or, alternatively, they might discover that they are better suited as friends. 2. Jordan declines Robin's date invitation: In the event that Jordan is not interested in Robin or is currently involved in a relationship, he could decline the invitation. This could potentially result in disappointment for Robin, but ultimately, it is necessary for both parties to respect each other's feelings and boundaries. 3. Jordan is undecided: If Jordan is unsure about his feelings or is hesitant about pursuing a relationship, he might need some time to think about Robin's proposal. In this case, the outcome depends on various factors, such as personal preferences, compatibility, and the potential consequences of their decision.

Short movie review: sixties-style slickness Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the given short movie review, it's not entirely clear whether the critic is thinking positively or negatively about the movie. The term \\"sixties-style slickness\\" can be interpreted in a couple of ways. However, before diving into the interpretations, let's look at the context behind the phrase. The sixties were a period known for radical change in terms of politics, culture, and fashion. This era brought about vibrant patterns, bold colors, and innovative designs, all of which contributed to the term \\"sixties-style.\\" \\"Slickness,\\" on the other hand, generally implies a sense of smoothness or polish. It can either be impressive and sophisticated or superficial and contrived, depending on the connotation. Now, considering the phrase \\"sixties-style slickness\\" in a movie review, it could be perceived in either a positive or negative light based on the critic's intent. Interpretation I, negative: In a negative context, the critic may be implying that the movie's style, visual appeal, or atmosphere is overly polished and superficial, perhaps even to the point of becoming cliché or outdated. In this case, the critic could be viewing the movie as trying too hard to tap into the nostalgia of the sixties without genuine depth or substance, thus resulting in an underwhelming cinematic experience. Interpretation II, positive: Conversely, the critic may be praising the movie for successfully capturing the distinctive charm and visual panache of the sixties era. This would mean that the \\"slickness\\" perceived in the film refers to a well-crafted, polished, and visually engaging production. Through this lens, the critic could be admiring the movie's ability to evoke a nostalgic feel while still presenting a dynamic and compelling narrative. In conclusion, it is difficult to assert with certainty whether the critic is thinking positively or negatively of the movie just by the phrase \\"sixties-style slickness.\\" However, by considering both possible interpretations and understanding the context behind the term, we can infer that the critic might be expressing either dissatisfaction with the movie's superficiality or admiration for its well-crafted visual style. Further context, such as a longer review or more information about the critic's usual preferences, would be necessary to accurately determine their stance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: This is the correct answer because it directly follows the given instructions and is the next step in performing squats and lunges. Keeping your arms extended in front, pushing your hips back, and bending your knees to a 90 degree angle is essential for correct squat and lunge form. a. Stretching the bottom of feet with the heel flat on the floor while rotating forward doesn't seem related to squats or lunges. The description better fits a calf stretch, which is not the next step in performing squats and lunges. b.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Bears traveled to the newly opened University of Phoenix Stadium to play the Arizona Cardinals, their former cross-town rivals. While many expected the game a lop-sided affair in favor of the 5-0 Bears, the Cardinals led the Bears before stumbling in the game's last quarter. The game marked the Bears' first Monday Night Football appearance since the 2003 NFL season, and second overall prime-time appearance of the season. The game started on an auspicious note for the Cardinals, as Rex Grossman faced a quick three and out after failing to connect to Bernard Berrian on a deep pass. The Cardinals responded offensively when rookie quarterback Matt Leinart threw two touchdowns in the first quarter. As Neil Rackers helped bolster the Cardinals lead with a set of field goals, Grossman continued to struggle and committed four turnovers in the first half alone. By half time, the Cardinals were leading the Bears by a score of 20-0, which was the largest deficit they had faced all season at that point. The Bears finally got on the score board in the third quarter when Robbie Gould kicked a 23-yard field goal. However, Rackers responded again to boost the Cardinals lead back to twenty points. By the game's third quarter, many had assumed the Cardinals had grasped their second win of the season, and the undefeated Bears would be forced to face defeat. However, in the dying minutes of the third quarter, the Bears' defense made a series of staunch defensive plays that allowed them to rally back. First, rookie defensive end Mark Anderson sacked Leinart, causing him to fumble. The loose ball was picked up by Mike Brown, who returned it for a 3-yard touchdown. Later, Brian Urlacher stripped the ball from running back Edgerrin James, and Charles Tillman recovered the football and returned it for another touchdown. The Bears, now only trailing by six points, took the lead when rookie punt returner Devin Hester returned a punt for an 83-yard touchdown. The Cardinals had one final attempt to win the game, but Rackers missed a 40-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Bears to kneel the clock out. After the game's conclusion, Dennis Green, who was the Cardinal's coach at the time, threw his infamous \\"They are who we thought they were!\\" postgame conference.

A:","completion":"'TVBS' is an 'instance of' a Satellite television channel and nationwide cable TV network. It is a specific example, or instance, of a broader category which includes other television broadcasters that provide their content via satellite or cable TV networks. TVBS is notable for being established by TVBI Company Limited, a subsidiary of Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) in Hong Kong, and ERA Group of Taiwan, and for becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of TVB of Hong Kong in early 2005. TVBS has been operational since September 28, 1993 and is an important part of Taiwan's media landscape. This media entity, like other terrestrial and digital broadcasting networks, operates by transmitting its broadcasting signal across a large geographic coverage, thanks to the technology of satellite transmission and cable distribution. Moreover, a satellite television channel and nationwide cable TV network like TVBS operates around the concept of broadcasting television programs that are relayed from a communications satellite orbiting the Earth directly to the viewer's location. Meanwhile, the concept of a cable TV network involves the distribution of content via coaxial or fiber-optic cables. TVBS, therefore, demonstrates the characteristics of these concepts, making it an instance of the said category. Hence, TVBS is a significant expression of the continued innovation and evolution of television broadcasting, signifying the transition from traditional terrestrial broadcasting to more efficient and expansive relay methods."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It’s a leaflet. Stop trying to trick us! The newspaper-leaflet has become a common electoral trope of late. In fact, during last year’s council elections, Conservatives in Haringey adopted a rather recognisable design for theirs. We get it. We really do.

Article: A new study has found that it may be possible to train people to be more intelligent, increasing the brainpower they had at birth. Until now,it has been widely assumed that the kind of mental ability that allows us to solve new problems without having any relevant previous experience--what psychologists call fluid intelligence--is innate and cannot be taught(though people can raise their grades on tests of it by practicing). But in the new study,researchers describe a method for improving this skill,along with experiments to prove it works. The key, researchers found, was carefully structured training in working memory--the kind that allows memorization of a telephone number just long enough to dial it.This type of memory is closely related to fluid intelligence,so the researchers reasoned that improving it might lead to improvements in fluid intelligence. First they measured fluid intelligence of volunteers using standard tests.Then they trained each in a complicated memory task--the child's card game,in which they had to recall a card they saw and heard.During the course, they needed to ignore irrelevant items, monitor ongoing performance,manage two tasks at the same time and connect related items to one another in space and time. The four groups experienced a half-hour of training daily for 8, 12, 17 and 19 days, respectively.To make sure they were not just improving their test-taking skills,the researchers compared them with control groups that took the tests without the training. The results, published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,were striking.Improvement in the trained groups was a lot greater.Moreover,the longer they trained, the higher their scores were.All performers,from the weakest to the strongest,showed significant improvement. \\"Our results show you can increase your intelligence with proper training.\\" said Dr Jaeggi, a co-author of the paper.\\"No one knows how long the gains will last after training stops,\\" he added, \\"and the experiment's design did not allow the...

We are given the equation: -28687*k - 56 = -28680*k Our goal is to find the value of k. To do this, we'll follow these steps: 1. Add 28680*k to each side of the equation: -28687*k + 28680*k - 56 = -28680*k + 28680*k This simplifies to: -7*k - 56 = 0 2.

In order to better understand this, let's delve deeper into the context and historical background that surround Khedive Ismael and his intentions. Khedive Ismael, who ruled Egypt between 1863 and 1879, was an ambitious leader with a vision to modernize Egypt and bring it up to par with the advancements happening in Western Europe. He had a grand vision for Egypt's infrastructure, economy, and culture and pursued a policy of modernization and reform during his reign. Ismael's plans included the expansion of railways, telegraph lines, irrigation projects, the construction of the Suez Canal, and the modernization of Egypt's educational system. These projects were seen as a way to transform Egypt into a global power and elevate the living conditions of its people. To finance these ambitious projects, Ismael sought external funding from European powers, primarily Britain and France. Initially, these powers were more than willing to support Ismael's vision, seeing the potential for their own financial gains and political influence in the region. However, over the course of his reign, Ismael found himself stuck in a financial quagmire, largely due to soaring debts, cost overruns, and mismanagement of funds. As Egypt's debt situation worsened and the risk of financial collapse loomed, the European powers that once readily supported Ismael's vision grew increasingly concerned. They insisted that in order to continue financing these grand projects and avoid defaulting on their loans, it was necessary for them to take direct control of key Egyptian institutions and bring in their advisors to oversee financial and administrative matters. This demand eventually culminated in the Dual Control Agreement of 1876, which put Egypt's finances under the joint control of Britain and France, with their representatives overseeing the revenues. This move was seen as an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty and greatly diminished Khedive Ismael's authority. The British and French advisors primarily focused on ensuring Egypt's financial stability and the repayment of debts, which meant that some of Ismael's grand plans were either scaled back or abandoned altogether. In conclusion, based on the given premise, it is clear that Khedive Ismael had ambitious plans and a vision for Egypt's modernization and overall development. However, his reliance on foreign financing and the financial crisis that ensued eventually led to the European powers taking control of key Egyptian institutions, limiting his ability to fully realize his grand plans and vision for Egypt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

According to this very helpful big-number page, a “decillion” in American usage means a 1 followed by 33 zeroes. “2,000 decillion” therefore could of course be written as a 2 followed by 36 zeroes, which is in fact what Anton has in parentheses. So good work there. But it turns out that a 1 followed by 36 zeroes is an “undecillion.” (This is a little embarrassing, since I’ve been going around using that term to refer to any number that is not a decillion, but I guess that was causing a lot of confusion anyway.) So he could have just demanded “two undecillion dollars,” and (after a little research) everybody would still have known what he was talking about. Sure, it would be more fun to call it “two octillion gigadollars,” but that’s getting a little ridiculous. Okay, it’s a lot more fun to call it “two octillion gigadollars,” as confirmed by an ongoing experiment in which I say that out loud in my office and then laugh at it. Not that it matters, because these demands have long since outstripped the total amount of money in the world. That was already the case back in 2008, when we were only talking about quadrillions. See “Katrina Victim Sues for Three Quadrillion Dollars,” Lowering the Bar (Jan. 12, 2008). At that time, I calculated that the plaintiff was essentially demanding the entire U.S. gross domestic product for the next 228 years (give or take), and that if he were paid in pennies (as he should have been) it would take 301 stacks of pennies, each stack high enough to reach Saturn, to satisfy the judgment. Less than two years later, Dalton Chiscolm decided it would take a lot more than that to send a message to Bank of America, which he sued for 1.784 septillion dollars (a.k.a. 1,784 billion trillion dollars, I think). “If he thinks Bank of America has branches on every planet in the cosmos,” Reuters then quoted a math professor as saying, “then it might start to make some sense.” That remained the record-holder despite John-Theodore: Anderson’s (stupid punctuation in original) effort in this 2010 case, in which he started out demanding a relatively restrained 918 billion for breach of contract but then got mad and amended his complaint to make it 38 quadrillion. That still only put him in second place, though. All of them have now been eclipsed by Anton, of course, who is also seeking punitive damages, I guess in case an undecillion-dollar judgment is not enough to send a message to the various defendants. Exactly what each of them did is not entirely clear, although the plaintiff claims a dog bit him on the middle finger and that he’s routinely overcharged for coffee at LaGuardia Airport, among other things. (Also, some Chinese people took his picture without permission.) The complaint does allege that the defendants’ acts caused damages that “cannot be repaired by money” and are “therefore priceless.” Granted, no amount of money can truly compensate a plaintiff for what he or she has lost, but two octillion gigadollars would be a pretty good start. ||||| We've encountered plenty of lawsuits about nothing and lawsuits that might as well have been about nothing, but a lawsuit filed this week by a Manhattan man may take the cake for greatest lawsuit about nothing. Anton Purisima is suing NYC, Au Bon Pain, Hoboken University, LaGuardia Airport, the MTA, and (literally) thousands more people for 2,000 decillion, which up until today, we thought was only used as a joke amount. And it's apparently over a dog bite. Lowering The Bar has an excerpt from the suit (note: the \\"Does 1-1000\\" refers to a thousand 'John Does') from the 62-year-old Purisima, who has previously sued the People's Republic of China, several major banks (including Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and Wachovia), and a whole lot of other people: Anton Purisima v. Au Bon Pain Store, Carepoint Health, Hoboken University Medical Center, Kmart Store 7749, St. Luke's Emergency Dept., New York City Transit Authority, City of New York, NYC MTA, LaGuardia Airport Administration, Amy Caggiula, Does 1-1000, Case No. 1:14 CV 2755 (S.D.N.Y. filed 4/11/2014). Civil rights violations, personal injury, discrimination on national origin, retaliation, harassment, fraud, attempted murder, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and conspiracy to defraud. 2,000 decillion (2,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). Pro Se So what inspired this historic lawsuit? Purisima claims that his middle finger was bitten off by a \\"rabies-infected\\" dog on a city bus; then a \\"Chinese couple\\" took photos of him as he was being treated; he's routinely overcharged for coffee at LaGuardia Airport (not sure how this is related, but it's in there); and there are other additional damages that \\"cannot be repaired by money\\" and are \\"therefore priceless.\\" Except it's not priceless, because he's valued it at two undecillion dollars, or \\"two octillion gigadollars,\\" or more simply, the number 2 with 36 zeroes behind it. For some context, xkcd crunched the numbers, and concluded that this amount of money basically doesn't exist: \\"Even if Au Bon Pain conquers the planet and puts everyone to work for them from now until the stars die, they wouldn't make a dent in the bill.\\" Hell, even if you extracted every element from the Earth and purified and sold them, it wouldn't come close to the amount. Purisima could certainly teach a super-villain a thing or two about demands. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A man named Anton Purisima sued many people and places, like a store, a hospital, and a city, because he believes they did many wrong things to him.

Question: Who flees on horseback after sentencing Miller? Movie title: High Noon Movie plot: In Hadleyville, a small town in New Mexico Territory, Marshal Will Kane (Cooper), newly married to Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly), is preparing to retire. The happy couple is departing for a new life, raising a family and running a store in another town; but word arrives that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a vicious outlaw who Kane sent to jail, has been released, and is arriving on the noon train. Miller's gangâhis younger brother Ben (Sheb Wooley), Jack Colby (Lee Van Cleef), and Jim Pierce (Robert J. Wilke)âawait his arrival at the train station; it is clear that Miller intends to exact revenge. For Amy, a devout Quaker and pacifist, the solution is simpleâleave town before Miller arrives; but Kane's sense of duty and honor is strong. \\"They're making me run,\\" he tells her. \\"I've never run from anybody before.\\" Besides, he says, Miller and his gang will hunt him down anyway. Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: She is leaving on the noon train, with or without him. While waiting at the hotel for the train, she meets Helen RamÃ­rez (Katy Jurado), who was once Miller's lover, and then Kane's, and is leaving as well. Amy understands why Helen is fleeing, but the reverse is not true: Helen tells Amy that if Kane were her man, she would not abandon him in his hour of need. Kane's efforts to round up a posse at the tavern and the church are met with fear and hostility. Many townspeople believe that Kane's departure would defuse the situation; a gunfight in the streets would be bad for the town's reputation. Others are Miller's friends, and resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place. Kane's young deputy Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges), who is bitter that Kane didn't recommend him as his successor, says he will stand with Kane only if Kane goes to the city fathers and \\"puts the word in\\" for him. Kane rejects the quid pro quo, and Pell turns in his badge.

Homer ( , \\"Hómēros\\") is the name ascribed by the ancient Greeks to the legendary author of the \\"Iliad\\" and the \\"Odyssey\\", two epic poems which are the central works of ancient Greek literature. The \\"Iliad\\" is set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek states. It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war. The \\"Odyssey\\" focuses on the journey home of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, after the fall of Troy. Many accounts of Homer's life circulated in classical antiquity, the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia, a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey. Modern scholars consider them legends. The Homeric Question—by whom, when, where and under what circumstances were the \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Odyssey\\" composed—continues to be debated. Broadly speaking, modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups. One holds that most of the \\"Iliad\\" and (according to some) the \\"Odyssey\\" are the works of a single poet of genius. The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and re-working by many contributors, and that \\"Homer\\" is best seen as a label for an entire tradition. It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late 8th or early 7th century BC. The poems are in Homeric Greek, also known as Epic Greek, a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic.

I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \\"sematary\\") in the forest behind the Creed's new home. On his first day at work, Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who has been mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. That night, Pascow comes to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient Micmac burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house, a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, the young Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway.

Question: \\"Which came earlier, Islam or the Kushan Empire?\\" Context: \\"The Kushan Empire, a collection of Yuezhi tribes, took control of the region in the first century CE and ruled until the 4th century CE during which time Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism were all practiced in the region. Later the Hephthalite Empire, a collection of nomadic tribes, moved into the region and Arabs brought Islam in the early eighth century. Central Asia continued in its role as a commercial crossroads, linking China, the steppes to the north, and the Islamic heartland.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the given context, the Kushan Empire came earlier than Islam. The Kushan Empire was established in the first century CE and ruled until the 4th century CE. During this time, a variety of religions were practiced, including Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism. However, Islam was not introduced to the region until the eighth century CE when Arabs moved into the region. The Kushan Empire, formed by a group of Yuezhi tribes, was significant during the early centuries, having a strong influence throughout their rule on the culture and religion of the region. Their reign saw the fusion of the Greco-Buddhist culture, which significantly influenced the development of the arts and philosophies in the region. This era also saw the prevalence of several religions, indicating the Empire's religious tolerance. Later, the Hephthalite Empire succeeded the Kushan Empire. They were a collection of nomadic tribes and continued to assert their influence over the region. However, despite the change of rule, one element remained constant in Central Asia— its role as a commercial crossroads. It continued to link the widely scattered realms of China, the northern steppes, and what would soon become the Islamic heartland. The introduction of Islam to this region did not occur until the early eighth century with the arrival of the Arabs. Following this, the religion of Islam began to spread, taking root not only in Central Asia but also across various parts of the world. Islam began in the 7th century in Mecca, a city in present-day Saudi Arabia, and was propagated by the Prophet Muhammad. Its core tenets are based on the Quran, regarded as the verbatim word of God. All in all, the sequence of these historical periods clearly indicates that the Kushan Empire predated the advent of Islam. Despite the different timescales and main religions, both periods had a profound impact on the region and played a significant part in shaping its historical and cultural landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Take pictures One of the great things about taking pictures at an event or a party is that it gives you an excuse to get in touch with the person later. Everybody loves seeing pictures of themselves, and it's very easy after taking a picture to say \\"If you'd like I can email it to you\\". This can be the seed that leads to new connections. 2. Eat alone in public You might feel self-conscious eating by yourself but it has an important benefit: you are much easier to approach when you are alone. People may be afraid of disturbing you or being rude if you talk with someone else. Bring a book or newspaper to read. Plus, having an interesting book with you will give others an excuse tostart a conversation if they've read it. 3. Join a class, sports team, or club Yoga, salsa dancing, volleyball, Toastmasters (a public speaking club), a class for work, etc. Choose a new hobby or continue an old one! These are all great places to meet new people, primarily because you will be made to see the same people over and over again in the class. You will automatically make friends with them if you have a common interest and are made to see each other again. The writer wants to tell you _ . A) how to make as many friends as you can B) how to make friends in a new city quickly C) how to build a social circle D) how to start a conversation with others The answer to this question is:","completion":"B) how to make friends in a new city quickly. Now let's discuss these three tricks in detail: 1. Take pictures: In today's digital world, taking pictures has become an integral part of our lives. It not only helps us keep memories of the events and gatherings we attend but also serves as an excellent conversation starter. When you take pictures of people at an event or a party and offer to share those pictures with them later, it gives you a reason to start a conversation. In turn, it offers an opportunity to get to know the person better and develop a bond. Furthermore, the joy people experience from seeing photos of themselves creates a positive association with you, which can ultimately lead to strong connections in your new social circle. 2. Eat alone in public: When you are new to a city, it can be intimidating to eat alone in public places. However, as mentioned in the tip, eating alone can make you more approachable. People are usually more inclined to strike up a conversation with someone who is alone compared to someone who is with a group of friends. To make yourself feel more comfortable, bring a book or newspaper to read while eating. This way, you have something to engage in if no one approaches you, and if someone does, the book or newspaper can serve as a conversation starter. 3. Join a class, sports team, or club: Another effective way to build a social circle in a new city is by joining a class, sports team, or club. Engaging in activities that interest you not only helps you stay productive but also puts you in a position where you will meet like-minded people. It's much easier to make friends when you share a common interest, as you'll have something to talk about and bond over. Moreover, the structure of classes or clubs usually facilitates repeated interactions with the same group of people. As you continue attending the sessions and interacting with others, you are more likely to develop friendships naturally. In conclusion, building a new social circle in a new city can be a challenge, especially for those who are shy. However, by using these three tricks—taking pictures at events, eating alone in public, and joining classes, sports teams, or clubs—you can quickly make new friends and establish a strong support network. These methods can also help improve your confidence and social skills, making it easier for you to navigate new social settings in the future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Which type of substance is considered a proton donor in a reaction? A: Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the concept of a proton donor. A proton donor in a reaction is a substance that donates a proton (H+) to another substance. This process is commonly related to acid-base reactions, where the substance donating the proton behaves as an acid. Step 2: Identify proton donor characteristics. To be considered a proton donor, a substance must be able to lose a proton (H+) and form a bond with another substance. This usually implies that the substance has one or more hydrogen atoms that are relatively easy to be removed during a reaction. Step 3: Respond with the appropriate type of substance. Considering the characteristics of a proton donor, it can be concluded that the type of substance that is considered a proton donor in a reaction is an acid.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who do Mrs. Travers and Foljame regard as their masters? , can you please find it? In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles. Charles persuades the khedive to accept Myers' cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to Clarissa.

Here is a news article: My name is Julie, I'm 28, female, and live in Clearwater, Florida, USA. And Cholinergic Urticaria has destroyed my life completely. I developed it exactly 3 years ago, in March 2013. After 3 years of physical and mental torture, pain, stress, anguish, heartache, no income, no help, no support, and no cure, I'm not sure how much more a person is expected to suffer daily like this. I've lost everything. I can't take it anymore and I'm begging for help. I've lost everything. Please. I've lived in Florida for eight and a half years now. Three years ago, in March 2013, I was working at a gymnastics gym for my fourth year in a row, and I was also a dance teacher. And I loved my life. And out of nowhere, I developed a rare skin condition called Cholinergic Urticaria. I am allergic to my own sweat. (And tears.) Me, out of all people. Someone who was so physically active everyday. And loved being out in the sun. I had to quit my jobs; my passions. And having my passions just stripped from me out of the blue one day, along with my whole life as I knew it, I cannot describe to you the depths of depression that exist when your life is just, taken from you. And you may think, 'oh big deal' but you dont realize how much your body sweats until you become allergic to it. I would say its one step shy of being allergic to breathing or blinking! Bodily functions you have no control over. And to add insult to injury, when you get sick, you find out who your true friends are. And that turned out to be nobody, sadly. People tell me to move up North, hah! As if that would make a difference. I get hives trying to shower. I break out if I even try to vacuum, in air conditioning! And the hives have gotten worse with each passing year. I've had times where 100% of my body is covered in painful itchy hives. It is very hard to find any doctor who has even heard of CU. And I have no medical insurance, so it's usually anywhere from 200 to 350 (US dollars) to make a new patient appointment. And every medication, lotion, or remedy I've found online, does absolutely nothing to treat it. When I try to find answers online it usually just says, \\"there has been very little research on CU since it is such a rare condition.\\" And for two and a half years now, I have applied for government, social security disability benefits/assistance, and I have been denied each time. Justice for all, right? I guess not. The judge stated that, \\"This does not affect my daily life.\\" Are you kidding me? This has DESTROYED my life! It has destroyed me too. I stopped living three years ago. Our judicial system in the US is so blind if they cannot see how obvious it is, that someone with CU is unable to perform daily tasks like a healthy person can, or work a normal job. Though I continue to be denied for my legal right for help? Isn't this why the Americans with Disabilities Act was established? To help people like me, who have worked hard my entire life since the day I was legally able to? That's ten years of my life that I have put in hard work wherever I was employed. And I'm a perfectionist so I really did work myself to the bone at every job I ever had, even though I received such little in return for my efforts. I know ten years is not a very long time, but I have no control over when I developed my disabilities. Yes, I have more illnesses than just CU and it's an everyday struggle. Especially because nobody has ever reached out a hand to help me. Even though I am now facing homelessness. I am outraged at our legal system here in the US, which is why I have turned to the internet now for help. When I went to trial to fight for my disability income rights, I was forced to go without representation, and was denied. I didn't know that I had any other option at the time because the judge said that they will not reschedule a new trial. So I feel I was taken advantage, because I was told I could either proceed without a lawyer, or simply be denied. And I had been waiting years for this court date, and both my lawyers didn't bother to show up. Not a single person in that courtroom told me there was any other option other than waiving my right to an attorney in order to proceed with the trial. But, now that I spoke to a real, legit lawyer, I am well aware how unfairly I was treated in my trial process. Because in the US, it is a Constitutional right that you are guaranteed representation for any trial. I also wasn't allowed to submit pictures. In fact, I couldn't even go up to the judge and show him my arms covered in hives, because he wasn't even in the room! He was on a screen via skype! And the only medical records they obtained were from the free clinic, (which is a joke) that contained so much false information that it sent me into a panic attack! (For example, it said I went back to work, I never went back to work!) I have not worked in three years because it is physically impossible for me. I wake up covered in hives everyday, even though I have the air conditioner on. I have layed in bed for the last three years straight to avoid sweating, and it breaks my heart every single day. I miss my old life so much. One without itching and without pain. I even dream about it. But when I wake up, only then does it turn into a nightmare. To know that my life will never be rhe same again. These everyday hives are so unbearable that I scratch my skin open and still continue to scratch because it just itches so bad. And after laying in bed all day everyday for 3 years now, I can barely stand or walk for more than a minute or two. My back has just given out. Especially since I went from being 100lbs to 200lbs from being almost completely immobile, unable to exercise, and so severely depressed that I cope with food. There is also added anxiety due to a number of things, one being that an allergist believes I can go into anaphylactic shock at any moment and die. But I can't afford an epi-pen. It saddens me so much to think about my life 3 years ago, compared to what Ive become now. Im unrecognizable. So I also developed Agoraphobia. Which means I almost never leave my apartment. Only for doctor appointments. Because when I see myself in store glass windows or doors, I can't even believe it's me. And people can be so cruel. People have made horrible comments about my weight gain, and it makes me feel worthless. And people have physically moved away from me in the store because they think I have some kind of contagious rash. It makes me feel like I'm some kind of monster. I went from being an outgoing, friendly, happy person, to someone who, has cried everyday for three years, has no friends or family, and never leaves my apartment. No man wants me once I tell them about my CU. It's like I'm damaged goods. I went from being a gymnast and a dancer, to not being able to walk through the grocery store, during the day, without receiving hurtful stares. It is just as emotionally painful as it is physically. I am a great person, and in this shallow, media infused society that we live in, we are judged by our looks. No matter how amazing of a person we might be. I am screaming out for help and no one even bats an eyelash. At least if I was approved for disability assistance I could stop eating free meals at the churches and wouldn't be facing homelessness. I am scared to death of what is going to happen to me because of that fact that I cannot work and therefore cannot afford the cost of living. And the thought of living on the streets of Florida in 100+F temperatures, just makes me start to panick. Just imagining how severe my hives would get, I would probably die. But which one sounds better to you? Death or living in Hell everyday? Im not suicidal, but just how much is a person supposed to take living like this everyday? I'm at my three year mark, and I'm at my breaking point both mentally and physically. Can anyone help me? ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| A Florida woman is speaking out about her rare condition, which has left her unable to leave the house during the day. Julie Reid said she developed a devastating immunological condition called cholinergic urticaria, which causes her skin to become hypersensitive to emotional stress and exercise. If she sweats, cries or simply takes a hot shower. \\"It's torture living like this, it's torture,\\" Reid said in an interview with ABC's Tampa Bay affiliate WFTS. \\"I just feel like a monster now.\\" She said she developed the immunological condition three years ago when she was working at a gymnastics gym. On a website to draw attention to her case, Reid said she has gained significant amount of weight and had to quit her job because the sweat would cause her to break out in massive hives for hours or days. She told WFTS she doesn't leave the house during the day over fear she could sweat and break out into hives. \\"I went from being a gymnast and a dancer, to not being able to walk through the grocery store, during the day, without receiving hurtful stares,\\" Reid said on her website. \\"It is just as emotionally painful as it is physically.\\" Reid could not be immediately reached by ABC News for further comment. The disease often comes on spontaneously, according to the National Organization for Rare Diseases, and doctors can only offer supporting medications such as antihistamines to patients. The disease will usually stop just as suddenly as it started, though there is no timeline for when it might end, according to the organization. \\"I cannot describe to you the depths of depression that exist when your life is just, taken from you,\\" Reid said on her website. You don't \\"realize how much your body sweats until you become allergic to it. I would say it's one step shy of being allergic to breathing or blinking!\\" Reid said without a job she has had difficulty paying for doctors appointments and has become depressed about her inability to return to her old life. \\"I'm allergic to myself,\\" she said. ||||| CLEARWATER, Fla - Julie Reid doesn't recognize her face in the mirror. \\"It's torture living like this, torture,\\" Reid said. The 28-year-old Clearwater transplant suffers from Cholinergic Urticaria, a rare hypersensitive skin condition that causes her to break out in hives all over her body because she is allergic to her own sweat and tears. The hives can last anywhere from an hour to several days. It is a condition that came on suddenly two years ago. \\"It itches like crazy, I scratch my skin open,\\" Reid said. Her condition came on without warning. Now Reid, who made a living as a gymnastics and dance instructor, can now longer follow her passion. Being outside is not possible either. The Florida heat and sun are just too much for her. \\"Any physical activity I do, I develop hives everywhere,\\" she said. Reid told ABC Action News she slipped into a deep depression and struggles to get out of bed. Over the past three years, she has put on more than 100 pounds. She admits she's turned to eating food to cope with her condition. \\"I used to be so beautiful, now I look like a monster,\\" she added. Reid has not left her apartment during the daytime hours in the past three years. She claims she has developed agoraphobia and fears to leave the house and deal with public scrutiny. \\"I just stay in bed and cry and cry,\\" she said. Unable to work, she's lost her health insurance. She says she's also been denied disability. \\"It's destroyed my life. I have no, I have nothing, I have nothing, no friends, no furniture, no help, no family here,\\" she said. She spends hours online searching for a cure but her condition is not curable. According to Reid, one doctor who previously treated her told her she could go into anaphylactic shock and requires an Epipen. She can't get it because she cannot afford it. Reid has no furniture in her apartment. She's sold it all to try and make ends meet and to pay for doctor visits. Fearful of her mental condition and emotional state, Reid reached out to ABC Action News for help. She is hoping someone out there will see her story and help her. She has documented her journey with a personal website, click here to view it. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Julie, a 28-year-old woman from Clearwater, Florida, suffers from a rare and debilitating skin condition called Cholinergic Urticaria. This condition, which Julie developed in March 2013, makes her allergic to her own sweat and tears, causing her to break out into painful, itchy hives whenever she sweats, cries, or even showers. As a former gymnast, dancer, and gymnastics coach, Julie loved her active lifestyle, but her condition has forced her to quit her passions and stay at home to avoid triggering the painful hives. Despite trying numerous medications, lotions, and remedies, none have relieved Julie's symptoms, and her condition is not well-understood due to its rarity. With no medical insurance, she has found it difficult and costly to get medical help. Furthermore, her applications for government disability benefits have been repeatedly denied, even though her condition severely impacts her daily life. Julie's condition has not only affected her physically but also emotionally, leading her into deep depression and agoraphobia. As a result, she rarely leaves her apartment during the day and has gained significant weight due to a combination of inactivity and emotional eating. Additionally, the condition has taken a toll on her personal relationships, leading to social isolation. Unfortunately, cholinergic urticaria does not yet have a cure. The National Organization for Rare Diseases states that the disease often appears and disappears suddenly, but there is no indication of when it might end. As Julie's condition continues to impact her daily life, she has turned to the internet for help, hoping that sharing her story will raise awareness and potentially lead to the assistance she desperately needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Most cases of food poisoning can be handled at home. Symptoms can begin within hours and last for hours or days and even longer in some cases. Mildly contaminated foods, or some types of contaminants, may not cause the symptoms to start for several days, or even longer. When the onset of symptoms is delayed, the duration of the problem can last for days to weeks. Chronic symptoms should be promptly evaluated by a doctor especially if you are having hematemesis or hematochezia, which is bloody vomit or diarrhea, respectively. The symptoms of food poisoning include nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, sweating, and fever. You may want to let your stomach settle for an hour or so, but then you need to start introducing fluids to prevent dehydration. Take small sips of whatever liquid you can most easily tolerate, and continue to drink as much as possible throughout the day. Sip on water or suck on ice chips. Taking small sips of water may help calm nausea and will provide your body with a small and steady dose of this essential liquid. If your stomach is not ready for liquid, then try putting ice chips in your mouth and let them dissolve. Try sucking on a ginger candy or drink some ginger tea. Ginger can help with digestion and treat stomach upset, diarrhea, and nausea. Diarrhea and vomiting also cause your body to lose essential electrolytes. A good way to replace the lost electrolytes is to sip on a caffeine-free sports drink (not an energy drink) once you can hold it down. Other products are available for adults and children that help to replenish fluids and restore electrolytes. These products are called electrolyte replacement drinks. Types of sports drinks include Gatorade and Powerade, to name a few. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist for a specific recommendation. Sometimes a little carbonation may actually help reduce symptoms of nausea. Try sipping on ginger ale or other clear carbonated beverages over ice. Sip on clear broth, such as chicken, vegetable, or beef, once your stomach has settled enough and you are not likely to trigger the nausea and vomiting. Starting with broth is a good way to help replenish fluids and begin to introduce nutrients back into your body. Move on to foods that are bland, low-fat, and easily digested. Some examples include saltine crackers, toast, and gelatin. Back away from these solid foods if your nausea returns. Some beverages should not be used while are trying to restore the fluids you lost during your illness. Some liquids pull water from your body tissues and contribute to the problem of dehydration. Alcoholic beverages are not to be used while you are still sick. Avoid caffeinated beverages including coffee, tea, colas, or energy drinks. Fruit juices and fruit drinks contain carbohydrates, are low in sodium, and may aggravate your upset stomach. Avoid dairy products and spicy drinks or foods until you are feeling better.

They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this. A lot of this is simply because they were treated so badly.\\" Dempsey said most of the tenants who filed suits still live at the apartment complex, although many are trying to find homes elsewhere. \\"The new apartments (they were provided) were not in very good shape.

Article: Most schools forbid chewing gum, but in a few years they might consider changing that rule. Why? Scientists are finding evidence that gum chewing may be good for your health. It may even help improve your test scores. This exciting research is just beginning. And in the meantime, companies are also experimenting with adding vitamins, minerals, medicines, and other substances that could give gum the power to cure headaches and fight everything from serious diseases to bad breath. Other researchers are finding that gum might work better than a pill to deliver medicines and other substances into the bloodstream. That's because the lining of our cheeks can absorb certain substances more quickly than our stomachs and intestines can. That discovery could help other researchers develop medicine-containing gums that fight colds, ease headaches, battle nervousness, and more. Scientists might even create antimicrobial gums that cure bad breath. Those projects may take years, but gum scientists have already had at least one recent success: They've created a gum that could help us stay awake. Researchers have produced a gum called Stay Alert. Each stick has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. It can take an hour for the caffeine in coffee to have its full effect, but the caffeine in Stay Alert _ in just a few minutes. The gum is easy to transport and it's stable in cold and hot climates. Unlike a pill, it doesn't require water to swallow. Those qualities make it easy for soldiers to use. For now, Stay Alert is available only to the military . The manufacturer may one day offer it for sale to the public. People who work at night, such as truck drivers and medical personnel who ride in ambulances, might benefit from a product like Stay Alert. Question: It can be inferred from the passage that _ .

John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.","completion":"The kingdom that converted to Christianity before Alodia, as mentioned in the provided text, is Nobadia.

Title: Little Children Movie plot: Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) is a 30-year-old, stay-at-home mother in a small Massachusetts suburban community. She had been working on a doctorate in English, but once she married Richard (Gregg Edelman) and had their daughter, the presently five-year-old Lucy (Sadie Goldstein), she set aside her research. Now she spends her days taking Lucy to a local park along with three other stay at-home mothers: the severe and judgmental Mary Ann (Mary B. McCann) and more timid Theresa (Trini Alvorado) and Cheryl (Marsha Dietlein). They enjoy ogling from a distance Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), the handsome and well built father who brings his son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), to the park. When their children use the same swing set, Sarah and Brad have an opportunity to talk to one another, titillating the other women. But when they, on a lark, hug and kiss, the women immediately take their children out of the park and refuse to associate with Sarah anymore.Both Brad and Sarah have unhappy home lives. Brad has yet to pass the Massachusetts state bar exam and doesn't even want to be a lawyer. However, his bossy wife, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), pushes him to succeed. She makes documentaries for public television for a living. They live a bit beyond their means, forcing them to accept financial support from Kathy's mother. Their sex life is non-existent because Kathy is too self-involved in her career and being a mother. When he is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, Brad instead sits and watches teenagers skateboard outside his house, fantasizing about being young and carefree again.

Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians. Question: \\"Why was Katherine unsuccessful in representing herself?\\" Response: \\"She did not produce the proper documents\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. Katherine was unsuccessful in representing herself because she did not bring the proper documentation to the administrative hearing, causing her to lose her appeal to restore her Medi-Cal benefits. Additionally, when she attempted to file a complaint against her landlord, the process was too confusing for her, leading her to give up and go home. These two factors contributed to her unsuccessful attempts at self-representation, making it even more difficult for her to address her various legal needs in an already challenging environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis.

Article: Have you ever imagined what human beings will look like in the future? Well, now you don't have to. According to AsapScience, a Canada-based video channel that touches on many different science topics, humans will be very different creatures 1,000 years from now. Artificial intelligence, genetic engineering and climate change will work together to change our bodies greatly, according to a video recently published by the channel. We could, for instance, develop red eyes as our DNA changes, and have darker skin because of global warming. The video painted a picture of a future world in which our bodies are part human, part machine. Nanobots, or tiny robots, will be put into our bodies, improving our abilities. \\"No longer will we be limited by our own physiology. We will truly become a mixture of biology and machine on the inside,\\" says the video. Meanwhile, designer babies will cause future generations to grow into intelligent, attractive people. As global warming takes hold, humans will also be skinnier and taller, as this body shape deals with heat better. In fact, Cadell Last, a researcher at the Global Brain Institute located in Belgium, believes change may happen even faster than this. As he said in a paper recently published in Current Aging Science, mankind is already going through a major evolutionary change. In less than four decades, Last claims, we will live longer, have children in old age and need artificial intelligence to finish daily tasks. \\"Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,\\" Last said. Instead of living fast and dying young, he believes humans will live slow and die old. \\"The biological clock isn't going to be around forever,\\" he added, and said that people could pause it for some time using future technology. Just a few hundred years ago, most humans were working in the fields, while nowadays more and more are getting an education. These are just predictions, and no one can be sure how human beings will evolve in the future. But with such large... Question: Which of the following would Cadell Last probably agree with? Options: A: Future babies will be designed according to their grandparents' wishes. B: Our increasing dependence on artificial intelligence will threaten our survival one day.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\".

During Leopold's illness performances were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According to the writer and musician Jane Glover, Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach. It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J. C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital. Wolfgang soon completed his Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16, and started his No. 4 in D major, K. 19 (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague). The D major symphony has, in Hildesheimer's words, \\"an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the routine methods of his [grown-up] contemporaries\\". These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical \\"Symphony No. 0\\" from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook. Three lost symphonies, identified in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's works only by their incipits (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period. Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental sonatas, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d. A set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts, was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented to her with an appropriate inscription in January 1765.

Which of the two areas had less dense water?","completion":"Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, had less dense water compared to Area B. This is because Area A experienced high levels of water stratification due to the fresh water discharged by the river. Freshwater has a lower density than saltwater, as it does not contain dissolved salts that contribute to the increased density in saltwater. When fresh river water meets and mixes with saltwater from the sea, it results in a less dense layer sitting above a denser, more saline layer. This stratification creates distinct layers within the water column, which reduces the mixing of the two layers. In contrast, Area B, situated 35 miles south, had water that was less stratified and more oxygenated, implying a greater mixing of water layers and possibly a higher salt content. Consequently, Area A's water was less dense than that of Area B due to the presence of freshwater from the Danube River."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Having spent more than a decade as a jazz artist, I've garnered some insights. As a youngster growing up in New Orleans, surrounded by the city's sounds and rhythms, I was influenced by a wide variety of music: brass bands, blues, ragtime, R&B, soul, rock 'n' roll, Dixieland and more. I played the percussion in my family's band, switching to piano at age 11. Since then, music has been a part of my everyday life. I've had the good fortune to play with inspiring artists across many genres -- Wynton Marsalis, Prince, Busta Rhymes among them. What's given me the foundation to be able to join such varied musicians is my jazz training. Jazz is subtle, emotional and accommodating. It is intellectual and sometimes even scientific. Most genres of music are not nearly as multidimensional, which in part is why the art form has such a small audience. In stark comparison to pop music, contemporary jazz seems too circuitous for most listeners to enjoy casually. The challenge for the contemporary jazz musician, as I see it, is making this subtle and complex art palatable to the greater public. Jazz is complex. Some of the greatest musical minds of all-time were jazz artists. They were able to master their instruments, redefine music theory and repeatedly innovate the already formidable body of work present before them. Many of them did so while navigating through the tumultuous social climate from which the music was birthed. John Blake: Dave Brubeck, ambassador to a new America. As a performer, part of my job is to take the audience on a musical journey to somewhere they've never been. The Stay Human movement I've started is about experiencing music -- not about it being on a stage and untouchable, but something that you viscerally experience on the subways and streets. Stay Human has grown to be more than a band, and has become a local movement that is expanding and shifting the way people experience jazz. We're trying to harness all of the musical elements that I grew up absorbing in New Orleans, and couple them with contemporary mainstream sounds. I want people to feel and hear jazz as they never thought it could be played. In the midst of the \\"plug in/tune out\\" nature of modern day society, we believe that the human interaction of a live musical performance can uplift humanity. Stay Human can happen anywhere. Not only in a music hall or official venue, but on streets and subways or among unsuspecting (and often pleased) patrons at a restaurant. We refer to these moments as a #loveriot and anyone can join. Keeping the Jazz Fest alive. At the core of the experience is the band, a group of my friends who are all world-class, Juilliard-trained musicians in their 20s. The music is central to the experience, but it isn't just about the music. Ultimately, it's about people from all walks of life coming together to share an authentic and transformative moment through the power of music. Maya Angelou once said, \\"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\\" Jazz is a tradition. The way jazz musicians walk, talk and greet each other, and the way they play is very distinct. To be a jazz artist is to be a part of a lineage. To play jazz is to contribute to world history. To be a part of this tradition means that you are challenged to transform other people with the sound of your instrument. You are challenged to swing. You are challenged to contribute to the body of work established by some of the greatest artistic minds of all time, work that includes these treasures:. • A performance of \\"Fine and Mellow\\" by Billie Holiday, Lester Young and others from a CBS television broadcast in New York on December 8, 1957. It is generally considered one of the greatest moments for jazz ever broadcast on live television. • \\"It Don't Mean A Thing\\" by Duke Ellington features catchy vocals, hard swing, jazz violin and awesome horn section parts that epitomize what the jazz tradition is all about. • \\"Every Time We Say Goodbye\\" Ray Charles and Betty Carter from their album together. Exquisite! • \\"I'm Just a Lucky So and So\\" from the album by Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. It is a supreme example of the blues with utmost sophistication and feeling. The way Duke accompanies Satchmo is masterful, and the personality of the two of them signifies what jazz is all about. Gene Seymour: Brubeck, jazz master with a big heart. As an artist, it is exciting to explore the sound of your identity. Jazz music teaches you about who you are by exploring the humanity of others. It accommodates who you are. The inimitable genius Charlie Parker stated it best when he said, \\"Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.\\" Jazz is an experience. Jazz is wonderful because it's all about the moment, and I firmly believe in creating unforgettable experiences. With the Stay Human band, it's never only about the stage. What we love is taking the music to the people in the streets -- jumping off stage into the audience, performing in moving vehicles, New York subways, streets and, yes, unsuspecting restaurants. For me, jazz is all about transformation in the moment. It is the most immediate form of musical expression in existence, and the language that we use to state our deepest, truest feelings.

Now let's break down the given problem: Question: Tim's university upgraded to a new telescope with a mirror that was a foot large in diameter than the old one. Tim will notice that he will be able to see details more clearly on celestial bodies using the ______. Option1: old telescope Option2: new telescope. Explanation: The larger the light collecting area, the more light a telescope gathers and the higher resolution (ability to see fine detail) it has. Using the Explanation, we understand that a telescope with a larger light collecting area has a higher resolution and is better at showing fine details. Now, let's compare the options with the information from the Explanation: Option1: old telescope - This has a smaller light collecting area. Option2: new telescope - This has a larger light collecting area due to its larger mirror size. Considering the Explanation, Tim will be able to see details more clearly on celestial bodies using the telescope with a larger light collecting area, which is the new telescope.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. I am facing a new situation today: Peter decided to sugar mangoes, ginger, pineapples, peaches to preserve them for next spring. He also bought blueberries and raspberries to eat fresh. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruit had a lower sugar content, mangoes or blueberries? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article, sugaring is used as a food preservation method where the food is packed with pure sugar to create an environment hostile to microbial life. However, the article does not directly provide any information on the sugar content of mangoes and blueberries. To answer the question \\"Which fruit has a lower sugar content, mangoes or blueberries?\\", we would need to look beyond the information available in the article and examine the natural sugar content of these two fruits. Mangoes are tropical fruits known for their sweetness and juicy pulp. They contain natural sugars like sucrose, fructose, and glucose. On average, a medium-sized mango (around 200 grams) contains approximately 45 grams of sugar. Blueberries, on the other hand, are small, round berries that are generally less sweet compared to mangoes. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and they also contain natural sugars such as fructose, glucose, and traces of sucrose. A 200-gram serving of blueberries (approximately equal in weight to the medium-sized mango) contains about 30 grams of sugar. Comparing the sugar content of the two fruits, we can conclude that blueberries have a lower sugar content than mangoes. It is essential to keep in mind that this information is not directly available in the background article, and the natural sugar content of fruits is distinct from the sugar content involved in the sugaring process mentioned in the article."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Becky Barrow. PUBLISHED:. 18:34 EST, 1 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 19:02 EST, 1 October 2012. The pensions revolution affecting up to 11million workers began yesterday. It is the biggest shake-up of pensions for more than a century and was hailed by ministers as ‘a truly radical social change’. For the first time, every boss will be forced to pay into a pension for their workers, who will be automatically signed up to the scheme. Pensions Minister Steve Webb, pictured, said the start of auto-enrolment, whereby for the first time every boss will be forced to pay into a pension for their workers, is a 'major milestone' Yesterday the first workers were ‘enrolled’ into the new pension schemes, with around 800,000 expected to be signed up before Christmas. Most workers aged between 22 and state pension age who are not members of a pension scheme will be signed up to a pension by their boss, known as automatic enrolment. Only the lowest earners, whose annual salary is £8,105 or less, will be exempted from the scheme. Workers who are auto-enrolled will join either a company scheme or the National Employment Savings Trust, known as NEST. At present, the majority of private sector workers do not put any money into a pension. If they do have a pension pot, it is worth an average of just £26,000. Under the new scheme, if a 30-year-old saved £50 a month, the pot would be worth around £90,000 at the age of 65, if the fund grew by 7 per cent a year. A £90,000 pension pot buys a 65-year-old man a pension of about £4,850 per year. A £26,000 pot buys an annual pension of about £1,500. The scheme was suggested by Lord Turner in 2005 when he was asked by the Labour government to try to solve Britain’s pensions crisis, but the launch has been a long time coming. Pensions Minister Steve Webb said yesterday that the start of auto-enrolment represents ‘a major milestone’ for workers as well as the Government’s attempt to solve the crisis. ‘Few policies affect as many people and this will be a truly radical social change,’ he said. Under the new scheme, if a 30-year-old saved £50 a month, the pot would be worth around £90,000 at the age of 65. ‘I’m determined to make sure that pensions are no longer seen as the preserve of the few.’ He said it made a break from many other Government reforms which he described as ‘just awful and horrible’. Mr Webb hailed the shake-up as the biggest pensions revolution since state pensions were introduced by a 1908 Act of Parliament. The CBI, Britain’s biggest business lobby group, said it is the start of ‘a new dawn for pension savers’ which it said will ‘tackle the ticking retirement time bomb’. Workers will pay into their pension – but so will their boss and the Government will also make its own contribution through tax relief. Contributions will begin low but will rise to 4 per cent of salary from workers, 3 per cent from their boss and 1 per cent from tax relief in October 2018, making a total of 8 per cent of salary. Workers will have the right to opt out immediately if they do not want to save into a pension for whatever reason, but bosses have no right to encourage, or even force, them to opt out. The Government admits it expects around a third of workers will opt out, with many expected to say they simply cannot afford to save at the current time. Britain’s biggest companies will be the first to enrol their workers, a process which began yesterday, followed by smaller businesses over the next six years. In October, around 380,000 workers will be signed up, followed by a further 420,000 in November, and workers will continue to be signed up over the next few years. Between February and May next year, around 6.5million will be automatically enrolled. Nobody can escape, from Tesco having to enrol workers who are not currently in the supermarket’s pension scheme to a couple who employ a nanny to look after their young children. An advertising campaign featuring TV stars such as Theo Paphitis and Nick Hewer was launched recently to raise awareness of the shake-up. Stephen Gay, director of savings at the Association of British Insurers, said: ‘Automatic enrolment is an opportunity not to be missed. ‘It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to save for retirement. ‘The fact that we are living longer is great, but we can no longer have our heads in the sand about how we fund our income in retirement. ‘The state pension is a foundation, but most people need more and the earlier people start to save the easier they will find it to build enough savings for their later life.’ The shake-up comes after official figures showed the number of private sector workers with a company pension scheme has collapsed to its lowest level since records began in 1953. Of the country’s 23.9million private sector workers, only 2.9million are paying into a company pension scheme. At their peak in 1967, there were 8.1million members. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: You might not know it, but there is something wonderful at your fingertips. You can make people happier, healthier and more hard-working just by touching their arms or holding their hands. Doctors say that body contact is a kind of medicine that can work wonders. When people are touched, the quantity of hemoglobin -a type of matter that produces the red color in blood increases greatly. This results in more oxygen reaching every part of the body and the whole body benefits. In experiments, bottle-fed baby monkeys were separated from their mothers for the first ten days of life. They became sad and negative. Studies showed the monkeys were more probable to become ill than other babies that were allowed to stay with their mothers. Human babies react in much the same way. Some years ago, a scientist noticed that some well-fed babies in a clean nursery became weak. Yet babies in another nursery were growing healthily, even though they ate less well and were not kept as clean. The reason, he concluded, was that they often had touches from nurses. Experiments show that most people like being touched. And nearly all doctors believe touch helps to reduce patients' fear of treatment. Of course there is time when a touch is not welcome. But even if we don't like being touched, a smile can make us feel better. Smiling increases blood flow and starts the production of \\"happy brain\\" chemicals. So let's have a big smile and don't forget to keep in touch. Question: According to the passage _ .

HMS Bulwark brought more than 400 people to safety after they were found 40 miles from the Libyan coast in inflatable boats. The European Commission has proposed a scheme to offer 20,000 refugees the right to resettle in the EU. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May has suggested that some rescued migrants should be returned home. The BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said a further 150 migrants had been transferred to HMS Bulwark from an Italian coastguard vessel and the ship would now head to Sicily. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the Royal Navy had rescued about 600 people so far this month. The Ministry of Defence said HMS Bulwark had been alerted to four 30ft boats in potential distress, each carrying about 100 people including pregnant women and children. Captain Nick Cooke Priest, commanding officer of HMS Bulwark, said people on the \\"precarious\\" boats were suffering from dehydration and injuries. \\"The weather at the moment is extremely hot so my ship's company and I are very pleased that we were able to bring them to safety,\\" he said. To help combat the migrant crisis, the European Commission has proposed the new resettlement scheme, which will take place over the next two years. By the end of May, it also plans to introduce a temporary mechanism for distributing thousands of migrants already in Europe among EU member states. But Mrs May said offering resettlement regardless of circumstances to migrants rescued from the Mediterranean would encourage more to make \\"perilous journeys\\". This was why the UK was not backing a resettlement quota plan, she said. Mr Fallon said HMS Bulwark had already proved to be an \\"invaluable asset in assisting with the Mediterranean migrant crisis\\". \\"The ship is providing medical assistance, food, water and dry clothes to those in need and will transfer them safely to land as soon as possible,\\" he said. The UN estimates that 60,000 people have already tried to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa this year. More than 1,800 migrants have died - a 20-fold increase on the same period in 2014. France, Germany, Italy and some other countries have backed the quota proposal, but a majority of EU governments would have to agree for it to become law. As things stand, the UK could decide to opt in to the scheme, but could not be compelled to join, as it has the power to opt out of justice and home affairs policies set by the EU - and asylum decisions are included in that opt-out. The Home Office has instead urged the EU to focus on combating people traffickers.","completion":"HMS Bulwark rescued over 400 migrants near the Libyan coast, amid ongoing discussions in the EU regarding a proposal to offer 20,000 refugees resettlement rights and the distribution of migrants among EU member states."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Compare East Antarctica's climate with West Antarctica's climate East Antarctica is larger, higher, and colder than West Antarctica. It is predominantly made up of a high, ice-covered plateau, with average temperatures ranging from -20°C to -60°C (-4°F to -76°F). It can reach even lower in the interior. Coastal regions of East Antarctica tend to be slightly warmer but still cold, ranging from -10°C to -40°C (14°F to -40°F). West Antarctica, on the other hand, has a more varied landscape and generally milder climate. The Antarctic Peninsula, located in West Antarctica, has the mildest climate on the continent, with coastal summer temperatures ranging from -2°C to 2°C (28°F to 36°F) and winter temperatures ranging from -15°C to -20°C (5°F to -4°F). The interior of West Antarctica is colder than the coastal areas, but still generally warmer than East Antarctica.

Article:At countless UN climate meetings, Mr De Brum was a passionate champion of the rights of small island states. He was instrumental in securing the \\"high ambition coalition\\" of rich and poor countries that was pivotal to a deal in the French capital. Mr De Brum died at his home in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands. Born near the end of WWII, Mr De Brum grew up in an era when the tiny Pacific state was being used to host a number of US nuclear bomb tests. When he was nine years old he witnessed one such detonation, while fishing with his grandfather around 200 miles away. The resulting destruction of the atolls, the evacuation of many islanders as a result of the atomic tests became a hotly contested political issue. The islander's push for independence and compensation played a large part in Tony De Brum's political awakening. As one of the Islands' first university graduates, Mr De Brum was heavily involved in the negotiations with the US that resulted in an agreement on independence and compensation signed in 1986. However it was the threat of rising seas and a changing climate became the key issues of his time as a Marshall Islands foreign minister. In the Paris climate negotiations, his warm, personal and relaxed style was very much in contrast to the stiffer, greyer faces of some teams. He used his charm to build strong personal relationships with many of the political leaders from rich and poor countries alike. This helped create the \\"coalition of high ambition,\\" a group that ultimately involved around 100 nations, including the US, the EU, African, Caribbean and island states. This alliance of rich and poor proved critical in pushing the deal through. The biggest win from Mr De Brum's perspective, was that the Paris agreement committed to the goal of keeping global temperature increases close to 1.5C - \\"1.5 to stay alive,\\" was a phrase often used by Mr De Brum. Tributes to the former minister have been led by the Marshall Islands' President Hilda Heine. \\"The very existence of the Paris Climate Agreement owes a lot to Tony De Brum,\\" she wrote in a statement. \\"He was a giant of history, a legend in every meaning of the world and a custodian of our shared future.\\" Others took to Twitter to extend their sympathies.

Security at the events was heightened after attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait on Friday. The Sun also reported that so-called Islamic State had planned to target a parade in Merton, South London. The newspaper said IS had plotted to detonate a pressure cooker bomb, but the plot failed after it informed police and security services. Police did not confirm the Sun's report but said it was \\"helpful\\" when journalists shared information that could indicate terrorist activity. Speaking in Guildford, Mr Cameron said: \\"Today, we celebrate our brave servicemen and women who work so hard to keep our country safe.\\" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and Vice Chief of the Defence Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach also attended the event. The Duke of York took the salute on the parade route on behalf of the Queen and Royal Family, as the Red Arrows staged a flypast. More than 150 events took place across the country to mark the seventh annual celebration. Mr Fallon told the BBC Armed Forces Day was a \\"huge opportunity to salute the armed forces for the service and the sacrifice they make on behalf of us all and also to pay tribute to families who support them\\". Earlier the PM chaired an emergency Cobra meeting to look at the UK's response to the attack in Tunisia. At least five Britons have been confirmed dead by the Foreign Office following the attack on Friday, but Mr Cameron warned the public must be prepared for a high British death toll. The Tunisian health ministry said eight Britons had been identified among the dead. Following the Cobra meeting Mr Cameron said: \\"Let's be clear. There's no doubt we face a very severe threat in our country and we have done for many months and many years. \\"But today is about paying tribute to our armed forces and their families who do so much to keep us safe and we should proceed with those events.\\" Meanwhile, the Sun reported that an IS leader in Syria unwittingly recruited an undercover investigator from the newspaper to carry out the attack in Merton. The Sun described the alleged plot as a \\"suicide\\" attack, saying IS was intending to strike soldiers from the unit of murdered soldier Lee Rigby. It alleged an IS leader, who it said was originally from Birmingham, told the investigator: \\"It will be big. We will hit the kuffar (unbelievers) hard InshAllah. Hit their soldiers in their own land.\\" The Merton parade was to be targeted because it was closest to the barracks in Woolwich where Fusilier Rigby, was murdered in May 2013, the newspaper said. Fusiliers from his regiment were to be among some 250 marchers, it added. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \\"The police, together with our security partners, remain alert to terrorist threats that may manifest here or where individuals overseas may seek to direct or inspire others to commit attacks in and against the UK. \\"It is always helpful when journalists share with us information, as The Sun did in this case, that could indicate terrorist or criminal activity.\\" Summary:","completion":"A big celebration was held for our brave servicemen and women, and everyone was extra careful to keep everyone safe after some recent attacks in different countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In Euclidean geometry, an isosceles trapezoid (isosceles trapezium in British English) is a convex quadrilateral with a line of symmetry bisecting one pair of opposite sides. It is a special case of a trapezoid. Alternatively, it can be defined as a trapezoid in which both legs and both base angles are of the same measure. Note that a non-rectangular parallelogram is not an isosceles trapezoid because of the second condition, or because it has no line of symmetry. In any isosceles trapezoid two opposite sides (the bases) are parallel, and the two other sides (the legs) are of equal length (properties shared with the parallelogram). The diagonals are also of equal length. The base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are equal in measure (there are in fact two pairs of equal base angles, where one base angle is the supplementary angle of a base angle at the other base). Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supported by the text: are the bases of a trapezoid always parallel?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step in the process of fossil formation, known as fossilization, typically begins with the death or deposition of an organism or its remains in a suitable environment that promotes preservation. This step is crucial in ensuring that the organism's remains have the best chance of undergoing the subsequent processes that ultimately lead to the creation of a fossil. There are several factors that contribute to a suitable environment and influence the chances of fossilization: 1. Rapid burial: Upon the death of an organism, its remains become susceptible to decay from exposure to elements, scavengers, or decomposition by microorganisms. In order to minimize the risk of destruction, rapid burial by sediments or other materials is essential. This may occur in various settings, such as riverbanks, lake bottoms, ocean floors, or sand dunes, where the remains can be quickly covered by sediments or other organic materials. 2. Anoxic conditions: The initial setting of burial plays a significant role in preserving the remains. In anoxic (or low-oxygen) conditions, the rate of decomposition is considerably slowed, allowing for the preservation of soft tissues in addition to hard parts such as bones, shells, or teeth. This can occur in deep oceanic environments, stagnant water bodies, or within certain types of sedimentary deposits. 3. Low-energy environment: A low-energy environment, meaning one where there is little physical disturbance due to water currents, wind, or other forces, is also important in promoting fossil preservation. Such an environment reduces the likelihood that the remains will be moved, damaged, or destroyed during the burial process, allowing for proper preservation. Some examples of low-energy environments include deep ocean floors, lagoons, or quiet lakes and ponds. 4. Geological stability: Over long periods, the remains of the organism must be protected from external forces to preserve their structural integrity. These external forces include factors such as erosion, tectonic activity, and extreme changes in temperature and pressure. Geological stability is necessary for maintaining the integrity of the remains as they gradually transform into fossils. 5. Early mineralization: In some cases, the early stages of fossilization can begin even before the organism is completely buried. This often occurs when the remains become infiltrated with mineral-rich waters that deposit minerals within the cellular structure of the organism, thus aiding the preservation and providing a scaffold for later stages of mineralization. In summary, the first step in the process of fossil formation often begins with the death or deposition of an organism or its remains in a suitable environment that promotes preservation, ensuring that the remains have the best chance of undergoing the subsequent processes leading to the creation of a fossil. Rapid burial, anoxic conditions, a low-energy environment, geological stability, and early mineralization all play a crucial role in this complex and fascinating process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He has won 43 events on the PGA Tour, including five major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), a PGA Championship (2005), and an Open Championship (2013). Mickelson is one of 16 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, where he has finished runner-up a record six times. Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments. Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event. That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut.

He is remembered mostly for his spectacular demonstrations of rocket propulsion that earned him the nickname \`\` Rocket Fritz '' . Opel was born in Rüsselsheim and educated at the technical university of Darmstadt . After graduation , he was made director of testing for the Opel company and also put in charge of publicity . In the 1920s , he became interested in using rockets in publicity stunts for the company and sought advice from Max Valier of the newly formed Verein für Raumschiffahrt ( VfR - \`\` Spaceflight Society '' ) and Friedrich Sander , a pyrotechnics manufacturer from Bremerhaven . On 15 March 1928 Opel tested his first rocket - powered car , the RAK.1 , and achieved a top speed of 75 km / h ( 47 mph ) in it , proving the feasibility of the concept of rocket propulsion . Less than two months later , he reached a speed of 230 km / h ( 143 mph ) in the RAK.2 , driven by 24 solid - fuel rockets . Later that same year , he purchased a sailplane named the \`\` Lippisch Ente '' ( Ente is \`\` duck '' in German ) from Alexander Lippisch and attached rocket motors to it , creating the world 's first rocket plane on 11 June .

About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.

Fritz was educated at the technical university of Darmstadt, and after graduation, he became the director of testing for the Opel company and was also put in charge of publicity. Primarily remembered for his remarkable demonstrations of rocket propulsion, Fritz von Opel's interest in rockets led him to carry out publicity stunts for the company. With the help of experts like Max Valier and Friedrich Sander, he tested rocket-powered vehicles such as the RAK.1 car, which achieved a top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph), and the RAK.2, which attained a speed of 230 km/h (143 mph). He also created the world's first rocket plane, the \\"Lippisch Ente,\\" and experimented with rocket-powered railway cars and motorcycles, like the RAK.3 and the Monster, respectively. Fritz von Opel's engineering work significantly contributed to the progress of the Opel company and pushed the boundaries of rocket propulsion technology at the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Apply some glue to the side of the teardrop, from the bottom point up to where it starts to curve into a dome. Press your first petal, tabbed side down, into the glue. Continue gluing the petals, one by one, until you complete your first row. Hot glue sets quickly, so work only one petal at a time. If you look at your teardrop, you will see some gaps between the petals. Fill those gaps with glue, then press more petals into the glue. Coat the bottom portion of the teardrop with glue. Wrap the fringe around it, with the jagged side facing up. The bottom edge should extend past the bottom of the tear drop and onto the stem. Cut off any excess fringe hanging off the side. Gently pinch the bottom part of the fringe, then twist it slightly around the wire. If you need to, secure the twisted part to the wire with a strip of florist's tape. Begin wrapping from the base of the fringe, where the pinched/twisted part is. Continue wrapping all the way to the bottom of the stem. Place the bottom point of the leaf against the stem and pinch it. Give it a slight twist, then secure it with green florist's tape. Repeat this step for all of the leaves you made. You can have them as close together or as far apart as you want. Some daisies are open all the way while others are closed. You can leave your daisy closed, if you want to, or you can gently pull down on the petals to open it up.

Please answer the following question: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study. I was continually taken aback by participants’... Why was the author aware of their positionality?

However, his world is suddenly destabilised by a series of unexplained murders (including Harold's best friend, Colin) and exploding bombs from an unknown foe. He and his henchmen try to uncover his attackers' identity whilst simultaneously trying not to worry their American visitors, who Harold believes will not go into business with him if they think he's not in full control of his affairs. The situation worsens when a pub in which they are about to have dinner at is blown up and Harold's partner, Victoria, tells the Americans that they are under attack from an unknown enemy. She suspects that Harold's right hand man, Jeff, knows more than he has been letting on about the attacks, while Jeff simultaneously starts to fear that Harold might be onto him and tries to prevent people from talking through intimidation. After some detective work, Harold confronts Jeff, who confesses that he sent Harold's friend Colin on a job to Belfast to deliver money raised by Irish Navvies (construction workers) to the IRA. When Harold discovers Jeff accepted a job to deliver funds to the IRA, he becomes extremely angry and vows to destroy the IRA in London. Jeff advises against this and explains that the IRA aren't just annoyed about some of the money which had gone missing, but also wrongly hold Harold responsible for the murder of three IRA men.

Since we do not have any information about Parviz Sorkhabi, determining their credibility is not possible. 2. Context and Relevance - A review should offer insights and opinions relevant to the subject being reviewed. This could involve sharing personal experiences, comparing it to other cases, or analyzing its features. Unfortunately, this review only has a name and does not provide any context, making it impossible to assess its relevance. 3.

Once again, the given review does not have any substance or specific details about the subject. 4. Coherence and Clarity - Effective reviews are well-organized, making it easier for readers to understand the points being made.

To hook marks, he acts like a well-to-do businessman, dressing like one and driving a Mercedes-Benz S500, believing that one must look like a professional in order to be a successful conman. Gaddis is searching for a new partner with whom he can perform more sophisticated cons. He discovers Rodrigo after he sees the young man playing some minor con games in a casino-bar. When Rodrigo is caught, Gaddis acts the part of a vice officer to save him from being arrested. Rodrigo's contribution is a face and naive manner so trustable that he is able to con anyone, while Richard is both completely unprincipled and clever. After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts. Richard accepts, and they plan to sell a fraudulent version of a silver certificate currency note to William Hannigan, a rich collector who is in town. Gyllenhaal plays Gaddis' sister Valerie, a concierge at a hotel. When Hannigan takes a fancy to the uptight but very sexy Valerie, Gaddis is forced to pull her into the scam, the price of which is Richard's admission to their brother Michael that he has cheated him out of his share of their inheritance. The plot twists constantly as each of the characters becomes more deeply invested in the scam, and the ever-deceitful Richard tries to cheat Rodrigo, Valerie and Michael out of their share of the take.
