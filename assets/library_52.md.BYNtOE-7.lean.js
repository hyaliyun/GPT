Markets Mixed as Focus Shifts to Earnings Wall Street edged higher on Thursday as investors weighed the impact of an agreement by lawmakers in Washington to reopen the federal government and raise the United States debt ceiling, but disappointing earnings from I.B.M. weighed on the Dow. In afternoon trading the Standard & Poorâs 500-share index was up 0.3 percent and Nasdaq composite gained 0.2 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average was 0.4 percent lower. âToday we are in a sigh of relief that we have averted the crisis, but longer term we havenât solved the problem,â said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank in Scottsdale, Ariz. âEarnings are going to reflect the damage that was done, and if not the earnings, definitely the forward guidance.â The Dow was dragged lower by I.B.M.'s shares hitting a two-year low a day after reporting a 4 percent drop in third-quarter revenue, weaker than expected. I.B.M., a tech bellwether, was also the worst performing stock on the S. & P., trading down 6.8 percent. Earlier Thursday, President Obama signed into law a last-minute agreement in Congress to end a partial government shutdown and pull the country back from the brink of a debt default that would have had damaging ripple effects across the world. The deal provides merely a temporary fix, however, as it finances the federal government until only Jan. 15 and raises the debt ceiling until Feb. 7, with the prospect of another bitter budget fight and shutdown early next year. âMarkets are back to business, the U.S. shutdown was just noise at the end,â said Vincent Ganne, analyst at FXCM. âThe spotlight is now on company news as well as on the Fedâs next policy meeting and the outlook for its quantitative easing program.â Around Europe, the Britainâs FTSE 100 index ended the session up 0.1 percent, Germanyâs DAX index lost 0.4 percent, and Franceâs CAC 40 down 0.1 percent. Asian indexes closed mixed earlier. On the earnings front, Goldman Sachs shares fell 2.7 percent after it said its quarterly profit dropped amid weak bond-trading volumes. But Verizon Communications shares rose 3.6 percent after the company posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue. EBay dropped 3.9 percent after the company gave a disappointing holiday forecast on Wednesday, saying the United States economic environment had deteriorated partly because of the government shutdown. Also, shares in food giant NestlÃ© rose 3.1 percent after the company said an improvement in emerging market demand helped increase sales growth in the third quarter, reassuring investors worried by recent negative news from European rivals Danone and Unilever. Carrefour, the worldâs No. 2 retailer, rose 3.1 percent after the group said sales at its French hypermarkets returned to growth in the third quarter while China sales also improved. Interest rates on ultra-short-term United States government debt, which had ballooned in recent days as fears of a default grew, fell sharply Thursday in wake of the deal in Washington. The rates on the October and November issues fell as much as 20 basis points to their lowest since the end of September.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family.

If \\"Small white dog with spot on back leaping in air with football in mouth with small boy and man watching.\\", does this mean that \\"The dog is happy.\\"?","completion":"Based on the given description, \\"Small white dog with spot on back leaping in air with football in mouth with small boy and man watching\\", it can be inferred that the dog might be happy. Here's a more detailed analysis: 1. Leaping in the air: Dogs often express their excitement and happiness through physical actions. Jumping or leaping in the air is one such action that can indicate a dog's joyful state. The small white dog leaping in the air, in this case, suggests the possibility of happiness and enthusiasm. 2. Football in mouth: Dogs are known to have an instinctual drive to fetch or carry objects in their mouths. Engaging in play activities, like carrying a football in their mouth, can be an indicator of a dog's happiness and contentment. As the dog in question is holding the football in its mouth, this can be another sign of the dog's happiness. 3. Attention from small boy and man: Dogs are social animals who find happiness and contentment in the presence of their human companions. Having the attention of a small boy and a man watching the dog can be seen as a source of happiness and joy for the dog. Social interaction and positive experiences, such as this one, often contribute to a dog's emotional well-being. 4. Inherent qualities of small white dogs: While dog personalities can vary widely based on factors such as breed, size, and individual temperament, many small white dogs are known for their playful and energetic nature. Assuming the provided description refers to a typical small white dog, one may further infer that the dog is likely to feel happy and joyful during playtime. However, it is important to note that while these elements suggest the potential for the dog's happiness, we cannot be entirely certain of the dog's emotional state without further context or direct observation of the dog's behavior and body language. Dogs display a wide range of emotions, and their expressions can be easily misinterpreted. It would be prudent to look for additional indicators of happiness, such as tail wagging or a relaxed demeanor, to confidently conclude that the dog is indeed happy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A butterfly lays an egg - A larvae matures inside of the egg - The caterpillar hatches from the egg - The caterpillar eats and grows - The caterpillar spins a coccoon around itself and forms into a pupa - The butterfly forms inside of the coccoon - The mature butterfly emerges from the coccoon - The butterfly mates - The female butterfly lays eggs. Question: suppose less larvae matures happens, how will it affect LESS butterflies. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less A decrease in the number of larvae maturing inside the eggs will lead to fewer butterflies. Let us break down the process to better understand this relationship. The life cycle of a butterfly involves four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult (butterfly). This process is as follows: 1. A butterfly lays an egg: The life cycle starts with an adult butterfly laying eggs on a host plant, providing a source of food for the caterpillar. 2. A larva matures inside of the egg: The larva, or caterpillar, develops inside the egg. This process is critical, as the larva must mature properly to progress to the next stage of the butterfly's life cycle. 3. The caterpillar hatches from the egg: Once the larva is fully developed, it hatches from the egg and emerges as a caterpillar. 4. The caterpillar eats and grows: The caterpillar feeds on the host plant and continues to grow, eventually outgrowing its exoskeleton during a process called molting. 5. The caterpillar spins a cocoon around itself and forms into a pupa: When the caterpillar is fully grown, it attaches itself to a stable surface and forms a protective cocoon ─ known as a chrysalis ─ around its body. Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar undergoes a metamorphosis, transforming into a pupa. 6. The butterfly forms inside of the cocoon: The pupa continues to develop within the chrysalis, eventually transitioning into the adult butterfly stage. 7. The mature butterfly emerges from the cocoon: Once the transformation is complete, the adult butterfly breaks free from the chrysalis and emerges. 8. The butterfly mates: Adult butterflies locate a mate and reproduce, restarting the cycle when the female butterfly lays eggs. Considering these steps, if fewer larvae mature inside the eggs, fewer caterpillars will hatch and become available to progress through the life cycle. This will directly result in a decreased number of caterpillars transitioning to the pupa stage and, subsequently, fewer adult butterflies emerging from the chrysalis. In conclusion, if less larvae maturity occurs, option B is correct, as there will be fewer butterflies successfully completing their life cycle and reproducing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a summary based on this article: The European-built Cupola was added to the International Space Station in 2010 and continues to provide the best room with a view anywhere. In addition to serving as an observation and work area when the crew operates the Station’s robotic arms, it also provides excellent views of Earth, celestial objects and visiting vehicles. Its fused-silica and borosilicate-glass windows, however, sometime suffer from impacts by tiny artificial objects: space debris. ESA astronaut Tim Peake took this photo from inside Cupola last month, showing a 7 mm-diameter circular chip gouged out by the impact from a tiny piece of space debris, possibly a paint flake or small metal fragment no bigger than a few thousandths of a millimetre across. The background just shows the inky blackness of space. “I am often asked if the International Space Station is hit by space debris. Yes – this is the chip in one of our Cupola windows, glad it is quadruple glazed!” says Tim. To cater for such possibilities, the Station is provided with extensive shielding around all vital crew and technical areas, so that minor strikes, like this one, pose no threat. While a chip like the one shown here may be minor, larger debris would pose a serious threat. An object up to 1 cm in size could disable an instrument or a critical flight system on a satellite. Anything above 1 cm could penetrate the shields of the Station’s crew modules, and anything larger than 10 cm could shatter a satellite or spacecraft into pieces. “ESA is at the forefront of developing and implementing debris-mitigation guidelines, because the best way to avoid problems from orbital debris is not to cause them in the first place,” says Holger Krag, Head of ESA’s Space Debris Office. “These guidelines are applied to all new missions flown by ESA, and include dumping fuel tanks and discharging batteries at the end of a mission, to avoid explosions, and ensuring that satellites reenter the atmosphere and safely burn up within 25 years of the end of their working lives.” More information Space Debris Clean Space SSA - Space Situational Awareness Challenge of Space Debris - April 2016 (Brochure, PDF) ||||| On Friday a number of movers and shakers in the space sector met at London’s Royal Astronomical Society to support the launch of ‘Adrift,’ an interactive art project that aims to raise awareness about the dangers of space debris. In the 60 years since the launch of Sputnik I—the first artificial object placed into orbit—space agencies have managed to create hundreds of millions of pieces of orbital debris. The vast majority of this debris (nearly 200 million pieces) are smaller than one centimeter, about 670,000 pieces are between 1 and 10 centimeters, and approximately 29,000 pieces of debris larger than 10 centimeters in orbit. While millions of specks of space trash might not sound so bad, when they’re moving at thousands of miles per hour in orbit they can do serious damage. ESA astronaut Tim Peake reminded the world of this threat earlier this year when he took a picture of a 7mm crack in the International Space Station’s cupola window that was likely caused by a rogue chip of paint only a few thousandths of a millimeter across. Chip in the ISS cupola made by a speck of paint. Image: ESA While it is impossible to track the millions of pieces of micro-debris in orbit, NASA and other space agencies are keeping tabs on most of the 29,000 larger pieces of debris, which pose a serious threat to the safety of crewed missions. These pieces of debris are the subject of ‘Adrift,’ a collaborative art project led by Cath Le Couteur and Nick Ryan who have created a machine that tracks 27,000 pieces of space junk in real time and turns them into music as they pass overhead. The art project also allows anybody to ‘adopt’ one of three different pieces of space junk, which will tweet at you every time the object passes overhead. The first piece of space debris up for adoption is the Vanguard I, the first solar powered satellite. Vanguard I was launched by the United States in 1958 making it the oldest object still in orbit. Then there’s the SuitSat, a Russian spacesuit that is full of trash was pushed out of the ISS in 2006 with a radio unit attached to it. The suit was nicknamed Ivan Ivanovich—the Russian equivalent of John Doe—which was also the name given to the mannequin used to test the Vostok spacecraft in the lead up to the Soviet Union’s first crewed missions. The SuitSat-1 fell out of orbit within a few weeks of its deployment, so it is unclear which piece of debris the SuitSat’s Twitter account is tracking. The final piece of space junk up for adoption is a piece from Fengyun-1C, a Chinese weather satellite that was intentionally destroyed by China with an anti-satellite missile in 2007. This particular event nearly doubled the amount of space debris in orbit in one fell swoop and raised concerns about the calamitous results of kinetic warfare in space. The music machine and debris adoption program are all in service of ‘Adrift,’ a mini-documentary focusing on the threat of space junk and the ongoing attempts to get it under control. Barring space warfare, some scientists are wringing their hands at the idea of Kessler Syndrome, an uncontrollable chain of collisions that would exponentially increase the amount of space debris in orbit once the amount of space junk in orbit reaches a certain threshold. Which is to say that if you want a vision of the future, imagine space junk ramming into space junk…forever. Although the International Telecommunications Union now requires that anyone who deploys a satellite must be able to deorbit the satellite within 25 years, space scientists are still grappling with how to remove the space junk that is already in orbit to stave off catastrophe. This has led to some pretty wild ideas for capturing and disposing of space junk, including blasting it with lasers and huge nets. Check out the mini-documentary here: ||||| A display shows approaching space debris as part of a digital art project around space debris created by British composer and sound artist Nick Ryan entitled 'Adrift' at the Royal Astronomical Society in London on November 18, 2016 The mass of \\"space junk\\" orbiting the Earth poses a serious threat to future exploration, a British scientist said on Friday at the launch of a project to raise awareness of the issue. \\"Tackling the problem of space debris is one of humankind's greatest environmental challenges, but is also perhaps the one that is the least known,\\" said Hugh Lewis, head of astronautics research at the University of Southampton. He was supporting the launch of a creative project at London's Royal Astronomical Society by artists and scientists aiming to shed light on the 27,000 pieces of debris being tracked as they orbit the Earth. There are believed to be around 100 million pieces in total, but some are too small to chart. So-called \\"space junk\\" has been left in space during the many missions that have taken place since the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, in 1957. The debris now poses a serious threat to future space exploration, scientists warn. \\"Every day, we use and rely on services provided by satellites without ever realising how vulnerable they are,\\" said Lewis. Space debris puts these satellites at risk of being destroyed or damaged and \\"may affect the dreams and ambitions of future generations to work and live in space\\", he said. The project, titled \\"Adrift\\", uses film, sound and social media to explore the dangers of space junk. A documentary by filmmaker Cath Le Couteur features British-American meteorologist and astronaut Piers Sellers, who dropped his spatula during a space walk on NASA's \\"Discovery\\" mission in 2006. The tool was left travelling at a speed of 27,000 kilometres per hour before burning up in the atmosphere. \\"Space debris as an operating astronaut, it was just the enemy... It's a sleet of very fast-moving stuff,\\" Sellers said in the film. Speaking at the launch, Le Couteur said the documentary highlighted a \\"critical contemporary crisis\\". \\"It is now a very serious threat to future space exploration, to us here on Earth, and to the damage and destruction of satellites that we rely on,\\" she said. Audiences can \\"adopt\\" a piece of space junk on Twitter, such as Vanguard, the second US satellite into space and the oldest existing piece of space debris. The project also includes an attempt to follow audibly the path of space debris, using an electromechanical sound instrument to transform its movement into sound. BAFTA-winning composer and sound artist Nick Ryan recorded 1,000 sounds using objects chosen to represent space debris—which itself is silent—and used it to represent live data from space.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkish pronunciation: [re'dZep taj'jip 'aerdo(W)an] ( listen); born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician serving as the current President of Turkey, holding the position since 2014. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, leading it to general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down upon his election as President in 2014. In 2001, Erdogan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdogan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yilmaz and Ciller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdogan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gul became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdogan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdogan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gul handed over the post. On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdogan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdogan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gul as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Canakkale, and one million in Izmir on 13 May. The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdogan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdogan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%. In the June 2011 elections, Erdogan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdogan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%).

Answer the above question based on the context below: The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa, made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra.

Rockefeller was the youngest of six children born to financier John Davison Rockefeller Jr. and socialite Abigail Greene \\"Abby\\" Aldrich. John Jr. was the only son of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia \\"Cettie\\" Spelman. Rockefeller traveled widely and met with both foreign rulers and U.S. presidents, beginning with Dwight D. Eisenhower. At times he served as an unofficial emissary on high-level business. Among the foreign leaders he met were Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro, Nikita Khrushchev, and Mikhail Gorbachev. In 1968, he declined an offer from his brother Nelson Rockefeller, then governor of New York, to appoint him to Robert F. Kennedy's Senate seat after Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968, a post Nelson also offered to their nephew John Davison \\"Jay\\" Rockefeller IV. President Jimmy Carter offered him the position of United States Secretary of the Treasury but he declined. Rockefeller was criticized for befriending foreign autocrats in order to expand Chase interests in their countries. The New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote in 2002 that Rockefeller \\"spent his life in the club of the ruling class and was loyal to members of the club, no matter what they did.\\" He noted that Rockefeller had cut profitable deals with \\"oil-rich dictators\\", \\"Soviet party bosses\\" and \\"Chinese perpetrators of the Cultural Revolution\\". Rockefeller met Henry Kissinger in 1954, when Kissinger was appointed a director of a seminal Council on Foreign Relations study group on nuclear weapons, of which David Rockefeller was a member. He named Kissinger to the board of trustees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and consulted with him frequently, with the subjects including the Chase Bank's interests in Chile and the possibility of the election of Salvador Allende in 1970. Rockefeller supported his \\"opening of China\\" initiative in 1971 as it afforded banking opportunities for the Chase Bank. Though a lifelong Republican and party contributor, he was a member of the moderate \\"Rockefeller Republicans\\" that arose out of the political ambitions and public policy stance of his brother Nelson. In 2006 he teamed up with former Goldman Sachs executives and others to form a fund-raising group based in Washington, Republicans Who Care, that supported moderate Republican candidates over more ideological contenders.","completion":"This text is about David Rockefeller.

Would \\"Twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week, unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime.\\" be a reasonable answer? Options: (I). No (II). Yes The answer is:","completion":"(I). No A \\"full job time\\" typically refers to a full-time job, which means that an employee works a minimum number of hours per week as defined by their employer and/or relevant labor laws. In many countries, including the United States, a full-time job typically consists of a 35 to 40 hour work week, distributed over five days. The statement \\"Twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week, unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime\\" does not accurately describe a full-time job, as it only gives an example of a specific work schedule that may or may not be considered full-time depending on the total number of hours worked and the company's policies or labor laws in the respective country. Some jobs do have alternative full-time schedules, such as working longer shifts over fewer days. These are often referred to as \\"compressed workweeks\\" or \\"alternative work schedules.\\" Though a 12-hour shift, three days per week, does not necessarily meet the traditional definition of full-time, it could be considered full-time if the total of 36 hours per week's work met the minimum hour requirements established by the employer or labor laws. Moreover, overtime payment regulations depend on various factors, such as the number of hours worked, the type of employment, and the jurisdiction. In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act governs overtime rules, and usually, an employee who works beyond the established 40-hour workweek is entitled to overtime pay, which is generally one-and-a-half times their regular rate. However, some salaried employees in specific positions or pay ranges may be exempt from such rules. In conclusion, although the statement you provided could relate to a specific type of full-time job, it does not offer a comprehensive explanation of what a full time job is since it focuses on an alternative work schedule example rather than describing the general concept of full-time employment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"To make an informed decision on which solution would be more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning, let us analyze both solutions first. Solution 1: Iron-on patches In this solution, grip-enhancing iron-on patches can be attached to the soles of toddler socks. These patches can be made from materials such as rubber or silicone, which are designed to have a high coefficient of friction, making them grippy when applied to the bottom of socks. Consider the following advantages and disadvantages: Advantages: 1. Easy application: Iron-on patches are relatively easy to apply, requiring only an iron to heat the adhesive and attach it securely to the sock material. 2. Customizability: This solution allows for the application of patches in different shapes, designs, and sizes, depending on the sock and the child's needs. 3. Effectiveness: The patches can significantly improve sock grip, making it harder for the child to slip. Disadvantages: 1. Durability: Over time, iron-on patches may wear out or fall off due to repeated washing or general wear and tear. 2. Compatibility: Some sock materials may not bond well with the adhesive on the patches, leading to an inefficient grip or uneven distribution of the added friction. Solution 2: Puffy paint In this solution, puffy paint or 3D fabric paint is applied to the bottom of the socks to create a pattern of raised, textured dots or lines that will enhance grip. Advantages: 1. Creativity: You can create custom patterns and designs, making the process fun for both the caregiver and child. 2. Affordability: Puffy paint is generally inexpensive and can be found at most craft stores or online. 3. Versatility: The paint can be used on numerous sock materials, allowing it to be a more versatile solution. Disadvantages: 1. Time-consuming: Applying and perfecting intricate patterns may be time-consuming, and the paint must be allowed to dry completely before the socks are wearable. 2. Reapplication: Since the puffy paint can wear off over time, especially after repeated washing and wear, reapplication may be necessary. 3. Safety concerns: Ensure that the paint is non-toxic and safe for children, as they may come into contact with their mouths. Taking the advantages and disadvantages of both solutions into account, it appears that Solution 2 (puffy paint) is the more sound choice in terms of naive physics reasoning. It offers greater versatility, customizability, and compatibility with various sock materials. Using both creative designs and purposeful application, the puffy paint offers improved grip where it is needed most. However, it is essential to consider other factors, such as practicality, cost, and convenience, when determining which solution is more suitable for the specific situation. Both solutions can improve grip on toddler socks, but the best choice depends on the individual's preferences and resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bezos, Amazon’s founder and the prospective new owner of The Washington Post, assured newsroom employees on Wednesday that he was committed to preserving quality journalism, investing in news and making sure The Post adhered to his underlying philosophy about content: “Don’t be boring.” Over the course of the day, he gave some indication of the kind of journalism that interested him, answered questions about the Post’s coverage of Amazon and did not disguise his interest at the intersection of his businesses, telling an afternoon meeting that “it should be as easy to get a subscription to The Post as it is to buy diapers on Amazon,” according to one employee who attended the meeting. The two-day visit was Mr. Bezos’s first trip to The Post since he agreed to buy the paper in early August for 250 million. Before the deal closes in October, Mr. Bezos made the visit to chat with employees from both the business and editorial sides about his plans for the company. By the end of his visit late Wednesday, Mr. Bezos seemed to have won over employees who posted photographs of him, speculated on how many electronic devices he had in his pockets, liberally quoted his thoughts on the news business on social media and gave him the hashtag #bezospalooza. Photo “He charmed the room of 20 hard-bitten journalists,” said Jeffrey Leen, The Post’s investigations editor, who attended a lunch meeting with Mr. Bezos. “He was a big supporter of investigative reporting, which warmed my heart. He already has a very good grasp of our business. It was, all in all, a very impressive performance.” Mr. Bezos started the day Wednesday with an hourlong breakfast with Bob Woodward in the ninth-floor publisher’s private dining room, where the two men dined on a fruit plate, poached eggs, spinach, coffee and orange juice. Mr. Woodward said in an e-mail after the meeting that through the breakfast, “Jeff Bezos explained the thinking behind his reasoned and careful step-by-step process in deciding to buy The Post.” Mr. Woodward added, “I was struck by how wide-ranging and methodical he is. He voiced strong, even intense, optimism about the future of The Post, and I suspect he will be calling on everyone here to pitch in with extra amounts of energy, focus and creativity.” Mr. Bezos then met for a little more than an hour for coffee with about 20 reporters in a neighboring ninth-floor conference room and talked about how he defined success. “What’s been happening over the last several years can’t continue to happen,” he said. Mr. Bezos told reporters that the paper should focus on delivering important, compelling stories to its readers. If it does that, advertisers will come, he said. Several reporters said that message left them upbeat after the meeting, convinced that Mr. Bezos was committed to high-quality journalism. “You got the feeling that he is not here to just take The Washington Post brand name and turn it into something else,” said one reporter who attended and spoke anonymously. “This is not somebody who is in a panic trying to make a profit for next year. He wants to solve it in a way that will endure for decades.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story For lunch, Mr. Bezos met with senior editors for a buffet of chicken, salmon, salad and cookies. Mr. Bezos mentioned that some of The Post’s recent coverage that he had found especially intriguing included the articles “9 Questions about Syria you were too embarrassed to ask“, and the obituary of a bouncer at The 9:30 Club, a well-known Washington club. In the late afternoon, Mr. Bezos met with the entire newsroom in the first-floor community room for a question-and-answer session that lasted an hour and 20 minutes. That was the most widely chronicled event, with employees posting Twitter messages and comments — or what they called “Bezosisms” — every few minutes. Mr. Bezos answered questions about why he decided to buy The Post and why he would be interested in buying a newspaper when Amazon had a reputation for being slow to answer reporters’ questions. Erik Wemple, the Post’s media reporter, quoted him on Twitter as saying, “I’ve always felt that the most powerful minds in the world can hold powerful inconsistencies.” Toward the end of the session, Mr. Bezos addressed more difficult questions like the possible conflict of interest between The Post and Amazon’s contract for computer work with the Central Intelligence Agency. One employee, who attended the session but did not feel comfortable speaking on the record about his future owner, said that while Mr. Bezos “danced around” his answer, he added that he expected The Post to aggressively cover this relationship. Mr. Bezos may have offered his most assuring comments when asked about his thoughts on journalism’s future. In a post, Cara Ann Kelly, The Washington Post’s Style Web producer, quoted him as saying, “If it’s hopeless — I would feel sorry for you guys — but I wouldn’t want to join you.” ||||| Jeffrey P. Bezos, the incoming owner of The Washington Post and founder and chief executive of Amazon, is pictured during his first visit to the newspaper’s office after agreeing to buy The Post for 250 million. Sept. 4, 2013 Jeffrey P. Bezos, the incoming owner of The Washington Post and founder and chief executive of Amazon, is pictured during his first visit to the newspaper’s office after agreeing to buy The Post for 250 million. Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post Jeffrey P. Bezos had a simple bit of advice for the staff of the newspaper he’ll soon own: Put readers, not advertisers, first. Don’t write to impress each other. And above all, “Don’t be boring.” In a whirlwind series of meetings over two days, the Amazon.com billionaire charmed and disarmed rooms full of skeptical journalists with a relentlessly upbeat vision that evoked The Washington Post’s best traditions while promising to update them for a technologically advanced new era. The Bezos plan for the news organization he has agreed to buy for 250 million centers on recreating the “daily ritual” of reading The Post as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories. He was bullish about creating that experience on tablet computers, lukewarm about the prospects of doing so on the Web, and reassuring about the future of the old-fashioned newspaper itself — at least for the foreseeable future. “People will buy a package,” Bezos said at one meeting of reporters and editors. “They will not pay for a story.” Bezos seemed relaxed throughout two days of meetings, including a town-hall-style session in The Post’s community room before hundreds of journalists. He spoke without notes and joked often, punctuating some of his witticisms and self-deprecating comments with explosive laughter. He remained poised and good-humored from his perch on stage at the town-hall meeting despite fighting a balky sound system. Jeff Bezos, the Internet mogul and Amazon.com founder, recently purchased The Washington Post in a historic shift for the newspaper. (Nicki DeMarco and Emi Kolawole/The Washington Post) Bezos also repeatedly emphasized the importance of investigative journalism and said he was prepared to stand up to pressure in reporting stories that government officials might seek to suppress. He also said his political views were already in line with those of The Post’s editorial page and would defer to its editor, Fred Hiatt, on many matters. “I don’t feel the need to have an opinion on every issue,” Bezos said. “I’m sure I don’t know much about things like Syria and foreign entanglements. I’m happy to let the experts opine on that.” Among those in attendance at the newsroom-wide meeting were former executive editors Ben Bradlee and Leonard Downie Jr., former managing editor Robert Kaiser and star investigative reporter Bob Woodward, lending the event an intergenerational bridge to the newspaper’s storied past. (Donald E. Graham, whose family controlled the newspaper for 80 years, was not there, but his niece, Post publisher Katharine Weymouth, was in attendance). After 90 minutes of hearing Bezos lay out his thoughts, Bradlee, 92, counted himself among those who came away with a positive first impression. “I thought he was original,” he said. “That’s what impressed me the most.” Throughout the day, Bezos returned to his idea of using tablets as a key vehicle for reaching a new generation of readers. While saying The Post’s print editions will remain for many years, he said tablet computers could offer readers a look and feel similar to a traditional printed paper. “You have to figure out: How can we make the new thing? Because you have to acknowledge that the physical print business is in structural decline,” he said. “You can’t pretend that that’s not the case. You have to accept it and move forward. . . . The death knell for any enterprise is to glorify the past, no matter how good it was, especially for an institution like The Washington Post, which has such a hallowed past.” In comments that cheered the newsroom, Bezos said The Post needed to grow in both revenue and readers, though he declined to say whether The Post newsroom would grow. “What has been happening over the last several years can’t continue to happen,” he said. “If every year we cut the newsroom a little more and a little more and a little more, we know where that ends.” Or as he put it repeatedly in meetings: “All businesses need to be forever young. . . . If your customer base ages with you as a company, you’re Woolworth’s.” Asked about the irony of his interest in buying a newspaper and Amazon’s practice of not commenting for many news stories, Bezos laughed and responded, “The most powerful minds can hold powerful inconsistencies.” He said one reason he often declines to comment is because he does not want his competition to know about his plans. “We’re not as silent or secretive as we’re sometimes portrayed,” he said of Amazon, conceding that “we are on the quiet side.” Bezos, who will remain in Seattle after his purchase of The Post closes in October, sidestepped a question about his future involvement in the Washington area. “I would never out-Don Don. Impossible,” he said, referring to Graham. “I will have to do this as Jeff. And it’s going to be different for so many reasons, and one of them is that I’m going to be in Seattle.” When asked to discuss Amazon’s motives in cutting off Web services for WikiLeaks in 2010, a time of intense government scrutiny of the anti-secrecy site’s disclosure of confidential military and diplomatic documents, Bezos said that the decision was made by unit managers and was not the result of government pressure. The company has previously said that WikiLeaks violated Amazon’s terms of service. Yet Bezos made clear that though he believes in “American exceptionalism,” he sees The Post’s traditional watchdog roles as essential. “We’re not perfect and our elected officials are not perfect and our regulators are not perfect,” he said in the newsroom question-and-answer session. “The credibility that an organization like The Washington Post brings is incredibly important.” The reaction to the new boss from around The Post’s newsroom was widely favorable. “What was most impressive was the combination of humility — that he doesn’t have all the answers yet — and the confidence that he will somehow figure it out,” said Marc Fisher, a veteran reporter and former Metro columnist. Added Valerie Strauss, another Post veteran, who writes an education blog: “There was a lot he didn’t say, but what he did was well received. It’s going to be a very different place.” Post reporters have already begun to refer to Bezos as “El Jeffe,” a play on the Spanish word for “chief” or “boss.” He ended what amounted to a two-day charm offensive by recalling for the newsroom his own encounter, as a young boy in the 1970s, with the impact of Post journalism. After apologizing for potentially embarrassing Woodward, Bezos said: “I watched the Watergate hearings on my elbow on the living-room floor next to my grandfather, who didn’t turn them off. And so these things make an impression.” Steven Mufson contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","completion":"In 2013, Amazon's founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, purchased The Washington Post for 250 million.

Plot title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IRÂ£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news.

The animated Disney musical “Moana” was again the No. 1 draw at North American multiplexes, collecting an estimated 28.4 million, for a two-week total of 119.9 million. “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” (Warner Bros.) was second, taking in 18.5 million, for a three-week domestic total of 183.5 million — officially blockbuster territory, especially when adding the 424.4 million in international ticket sales. Several art films hoping for Oscar attention played to mixed results in limited release. “Jackie” (Fox Searchlight), starring Natalie Portman as a calculating Jacqueline Kennedy, arrived in five theaters and collected a stout 275,000, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. “Miss Sloane” (EuropaCorp), starring Jessica Chastain as a political powerbroker, sold 123,036 in tickets in four theaters. “Lion” (the Weinstein Company), an adoption drama starring Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman, managed 120,234 in seven theaters, for a two-week total of 279,382. In its third weekend, the acclaimed drama “Manchester by the Sea” (Roadside Attractions), starring Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams, had ticket sales of 2.4 million at 156 theaters, for a new total of 4.4 million. The first weekend in December can be a rare dead zone on Hollywood’s release calendar. Studios hold back new films because people tend to be too worn out from Thanksgiving or too busy with Christmas-related chores to squeeze in a trip to the movies. Starting on Friday, however, studios will roll out 15 major films during 17 days in a race to capitalize on holiday vacations. (When in doubt, take Aunt Edna to the movies.)

At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an international organization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, lobbying and education. IUCN's mission is to \\"influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable.\\" - Pirkanmaa (also known as Tampere Region in government documents), is a region of Finland. It borders on the regions of Satakunta, Tavastia Proper, Päijät-Häme, Southern Ostrobothnia, Central Finland and Southwest Finland. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\". - A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas. - A swamp is a wetland that is forested. Many swamps occur along large rivers where they are critically dependent upon natural water level fluctuations. Other swamps occur on the shores of large lakes. Some swamps have hammocks, or dry-land protrusions, covered by aquatic vegetation, or vegetation that tolerates periodic inundation. The two main types of swamp are \\"true\\" or swamp forests and \\"transitional\\" or shrub swamps. In the boreal regions of Canada, the word swamp is colloquially used for what is more correctly termed a bog or muskeg. The water of a swamp may be fresh water, brackish water or seawater. Some of the world's largest swamps are found along major rivers such as the Amazon, the Mississippi, and the Congo. - Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe. - A park is an area of natural, semi-natural, or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. It may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil, and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \\"dog parks\\", permit dogs to run off-leash. - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition. - An esker, eskar, eschar, or os, sometimes called an \\"asar\\", \\"osar\\", or \\"serpent kame\\", is a long, winding ridge of stratified sand and gravel, examples of which occur in glaciated and formerly glaciated regions of Europe and North America. Eskers are frequently several kilometres long and, because of their peculiar uniform shape, are somewhat like railway embankments. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - A drainage divide, water divide, divide, ridgeline, watershed, water parting, or (in Canada) height of land, is the line that separates neighbouring drainage basins. In hilly country, the divide lies along topographical ridges, and may be in the form of a single range of hills or mountains, known as a \\"dividing range\\". In flat countryespecially where the ground is marshythe divide may be harder to discern. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - The Finnish forest reindeer \\"(Rangifer tarandus fennicus)\\" (Finnish:\\" metsäpeura\\", Russian: \\" \\") is a rare and threatened subspecies of reindeer native to Finland and northwestern Russia. They are found primarily in Russian Karelia, and the provinces of North Karelia, Savonia and Kainuu in Finland, though some range into central south Finland. They are distinct from the semi-domesticated Northern reindeer (\\"Rangifer tarandus tarandus\\") in their larger size and preference for dense boreal forest habitat, where they are rarely seen by humans, over the open tundra. They migrate seasonally back and forth across the long Russo-Finnish border. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Seitseminen National Park ( Finnish : Seitsemisen kansallispuisto ) is located in the municipalities of Ikaalinen and Ylöjärvi in Finland . The national park was established in 1982 and later expanded in 1989 . It now covers 45.5 square kilometres ( 17.6 sq mi ) . The park is a typical mix of upland and lowland coniferous boreal forests of the Suomenselkä watershed region . Upland areas are dominated by closed productive stands of Norway spruce and Scots pine while lowland areas are covered by sphagnum swamp and bog areas that also contain stunted ( Scots pine ) and shrublike ( Norway spruce ) . These swamp and bog areas appear to be barren due to the sparse tree densities . Parts of the park contain some of the most ancient and oldest forests that are accessible to public in Finland . The Kovero Farm ( Finnish : Koveron kruununmetsätorppa ) , a tenant farm established in 1859 , is part of the cultural heritage area of the park . Seitseminen National Park received the European Diploma of Protected Areas on June 19 , 1996 . It was valid until June 2011 . - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Ikaalinen is a town and municipality of Finland. It is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Pirkanmaa region. The town has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is - The Gulf of Finland is the easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf. - The World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) is one of six commissions of the IUCN (World Conservation Union). WCPA is the world's premier network of protected area expertise. It is administered by IUCN's Global Protected Areas Programme and has over 2,400 members, spanning 140 countries. - Population density (in agriculture: standing stock and standing crop) is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density. It is frequently applied to living organisms, and most of the time to humans. It is a key geographical term. - The Gulf of Bothnia is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the Åland Islands, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea. - Tampere (Swedish: \\"Tammerfors\\" ) is a city in Pirkanmaa, southern Finland. It is the most populous inland city in any of the Nordic countries. - Suomenselkä is a drainage divide in western Finland. Roughly long and wide, it is marked by an ensemble of northeast-southwest oriented moraines parallel to the Bothnian coastline. Rivers flowing west from Suomenselkä drain to the Gulf of Bothnia and the lakes in the east drain to the Gulf of Finland. Historically, this very sparsely populated region separated Ostrobothnia from the southern and eastern lake regions of Finland. The landscape is marked by moraines, eskers, swamps and forests and is difficult to cultivate or settle in. Because it contains some of the few remaining patches of old-growth forest in southern Finland, it is one of the few remaining habitats for Finnish Forest Reindeer (\\"Rangifer tarandus fennica\\"). - A moraine is any glacially formed accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris (soil and rock) that occurs in both currently and formerly glaciated regions on Earth (i.e. a past glacial maximum), through geomorphological processes. Moraines are formed from debris previously carried along by a glacier and normally consist of somewhat rounded particles ranging in size from large boulders to minute glacial flour. Lateral moraines are formed at the side of the ice flow and terminal moraines at the foot, marking the maximum advance of the glacier. Other types of moraine include ground moraines, till-covered areas with irregular topography, and medial moraines which are formed where two glaciers meet. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - An old-growth forest also termed primary forest, virgin forest, primeval forest, late seral forest, or (in Britain) ancient woodland is a forest that has attained great age without significant disturbance and thereby exhibits unique ecological features and might be classified as a climax community. Old-growth features include diverse tree-related structures that provide diverse wildlife habitat that increases the bio-diversity of the forested ecosystem. The concept of diverse tree structure includes multi-layered canopies and canopy gaps, greatly varying tree heights and diameters, and diverse tree species and classes and sizes of woody debris. - Ylöjärvi is a town and a municipality in Western Finland, west of Tampere and north of Finlands capital city Helsinki.

They travel to Muir Woods and Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, where Madeleine runs down towards the ocean. Scottie grabs her and they embrace. Madeleine recounts a nightmare and Scottie identifies its setting as Mission San Juan Bautista. He drives her there and they express their love for each other. Madeleine suddenly runs into the church and up the bell tower. Scottie, halted on the steps by his vertigo, sees Madeleine plunge to her death. The death is declared a suicide. Gavin does not fault Scottie, but Scottie breaks down, becomes clinically depressed and is in a sanatorium, almost catatonic. After release, Scottie frequents the places that Madeleine visited, often imagining that he sees her. One day, he notices a woman who reminds him of Madeleine,...

This is accompanied by a blunt bass line and frenetic drumming. The song's dirty sound was produced using an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff distortion pedal, which is augmented by a second guitar providing more distortion. Music writer Brian J. Barr referred to this noisy sound as \\"the sonic equivalent of an amplified comb scraping against paper\\".Critics have noted a Stooges influence in \\"Touch Me I'm Sick\\", typical of Mudhoney's early material. Turner said: \\"In retrospect, it's The Yardbirds' 'Happenings Ten Years Time Ago' by way of The Stooges' 'Sick of You'. At the time I was trying for the stuttering R&B guitar of The Nights and Days.\\" The song is also reminiscent of the hardcore punk of Black Flag. In his book Loser: The Real Seattle Music Story, Clark Humphrey accuses the song of being a copy of \\"The Witch\\" by The Sonics. The band have dismissed this claim, and questioned the writer's knowledge of music.Arm's lyrics, according to critic Steve Huey, are a rant about \\"disease, self-loathing, angst, and dirty sex\\". In an essay called \\"'Touch Me I'm Sick': Contagion as Critique in Punk and Performance Art\\", Catherine J. Creswell suggests that some of the lyrics refer to AIDS. According to Creswell, \\"In declaring 'Well, I'm diseased and I don't mind' and changing the final refrain to 'Fuck Me, I'm Sick!' the speaker declares himself to be the viral, 'AIDS-bearing,' 'polluting' person of contemporary fantasy\\". Creswell, who also believes the song parodies the theme of seduction in contemporary rock music, points to lyrics that refer to impotence (\\"If you don't come, if you don't come, if you don't come, you'll die alone!\\") and violent possession or forcing (\\"I'll make you love me till the day you die!\\").

This idea is based on lyrics such as \\"Well, I'm diseased and I don't mind\\" and the amended refrain \\"Fuck Me, I'm Sick!\\".

Write an article based on this summary: – It's Election Day, and Democrats' chances of retaining control of the Senate look pretty slim, according to election models at the Washington Post, the New York Times, and FiveThirtyEight, which put the chances of a GOP victory at 96%, 73%, and 76%, respectively. The Post notes that all three election models agree that the GOP is likely to pick up seats in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia, while Democrats will probably hang on to North Carolina and New Hampshire—leaving Alaska, Georgia, Iowa, and Kansas as the races to watch. Harry Reid says the Iowa race will be crucial for Senate control, although there is a chance control may not be decided today, or even this month. More: Mitt Romney believes the polls this time around and he's confident about the GOP's chances, the Hill reports. This election is the \\"last chance\\" for voters to \\"pass judgment,\\" says Romney, who has campaigned for Republicans across the country but hasn't indicated he's planning a third bid for the presidency. Despite an economy that's slowly finding its stride, polls indicate voter interest is \\"substantially lower\\" than it was four years ago, with a populace worn down by ISIS and Ebola, the Times reports. Lackluster candidates comparing each other to Taylor Swift and clown cars haven't helped. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell—heavily favored to win his race in Kentucky—may soon be the body's majority leader, and he told a crowd last night that the rollback of President Obama's policies will begin today, Politico reports. \\"These people need to be stopped and it starts tomorrow night,\\" he said. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to limit their losses in an election that also stands to give the GOP its biggest share of the House since it held 246 seats in 1946, the AP reports. Democratic incumbents are struggling in many of today's 36 gubernatorial contests as well, but the party holds out hope that a huge get-out-the-vote operation will save its Senate majority. And if the Republicans do usurp Senate power? They'll have pulled off a \\"spectacular feat,\\" as NPR puts it, with a victory despite their \\"non-transformation\\"—in other words, without changing a platform that was supposedly destined to doom them, like opposition to ObamaCare, gay marriage, and abortion rights. Democrats also hope that overzealous Republicans, if they do take over, might actually work to their advantage ahead of the 2016 presidential elections. \\"If Republicans take the Senate and expand their margins in the House, no one in their right mind would believe that Ted Cruz and the Tea Party House Republicans will say, 'Now is the time for us to compromise'. They're going to double down,\\" Democratic Rep. Steve Israel tells the Times. We could be in for a late night ... or an early one.","completion":"Election Day: Democrats' Struggle for Senate Control As it is Election Day in the United States, Democrats are facing an uphill battle to maintain control of the Senate. Election models from the Washington Post, the New York Times, and FiveThirtyEight present a bleak picture for the Democrats, with their chances of retaining control at 4%, 27%, and 24%, respectively. The consensus among these models suggests that the GOP (Republican Party) is poised to gain seats in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia, while Democrats are likely to hold on to North Carolina and New Hampshire. Key races in Alaska, Georgia, Iowa, and Kansas will be crucial in determining the final outcome. Many eyes are on the Iowa race, which Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid believes will be pivotal for Senate control. However, the possibility remains that control may not be decided on Election Day, or even within this month. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has weighed in, expressing confidence in the GOP's chances and stressing that this election is the \\"last chance\\" for voters to \\"pass judgment\\" on the current administration. Despite a gradually improving economy, voter interest has been \\"substantially lower\\" than in previous elections, as ongoing concerns about ISIS and Ebola have consumed the American public's attention. Additionally, lackluster candidates with forgettable campaign strategies have done little to engage voters and inspire them to participate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is expected to win his race in Kentucky, may be in line to become the body's majority leader. At a recent rally, he pledged that if the GOP wins control of the Senate, they will begin to roll back President Obama's policies. \\"These people need to be stopped, and it starts tomorrow night,\\" McConnell said. On the other hand, Democrats are focusing on mitigating the damage and attempting to maintain their majority in the Senate. The party is also holding onto hope that their extensive get-out-the-vote operation will tip the scales in their favor. If Republicans do manage to take control of the Senate, it will be seen as a surprisingly successful victory, considering their controversial stance on issues such as gay marriage, abortion rights, and opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Democrats are also considering the possibility that an overzealous Republican majority could work to their advantage in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential elections. Democratic Representative Steve Israel highlighted this potential outcome, stating, \\"If Republicans take the Senate and expand their margins in the House, no one in their right mind would believe that Ted Cruz and the Tea Party House Republicans will say, 'Now is the time for us to compromise'. They're going to double down.\\" As the election results come in, it's clear that this is a pivotal moment for both parties, with the balance of power in the United States government hanging in the balance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We are assuming that the greater the mass of the objects, the stronger the gravitational pull between them. Now, let's analyze the given assumption: - The greater the mass of the objects, the stronger the gravitational pull between them. Given this assumption, we can determine the following: - Since the very small mass planets have lower masses than the small mass planets, they will have a weaker gravitational pull between them, as per the assumption provided. This is because a smaller mass will result in a weaker gravitational force between them, according to the assumption.

Make this proper case","completion":"The Commission Addresses the Heads of Government in a Declaration on the State of the Community Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed heads of government, distinguished delegates, and valued citizens of the global community, It is with great responsibility and a sense of urgency that the Commission has convened to address the current state of our shared community. As we navigate through challenging times and confront complex issues, effective communication and cooperation between our governments remain of paramount importance. Therefore, the Commission hereby presents this declaration to provide insights into the state of our community, express our concerns, and propose recommendations for a collaborative path forward. Firstly, it is crucial to acknowledge that our community has made tremendous progress over recent decades in various areas, such as global health, economic growth, and technological advancement. Notable achievements, such as the eradication of diseases, the rapid progression of the digital revolution, and increased global connectivity, have significantly improved the lives of millions across the globe. However, it is also essential to recognize the challenges we face collectively. These challenges demand our attention and timely, coherent action to preserve the well-being of our global community. Among these pressing issues are: 1. Climate Change: The increasing threat of climate change is one of the most urgent global crises. The consequences of rising temperatures, severe weather events, and increased greenhouse gas emissions disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. We must work diligently to adopt sustainable energy sources, promote environmentally-friendly practices, and reduce our collective carbon footprint to safeguard the planet for future generations. 2. Economic Inequality: Despite economic growth, income and wealth inequality remains a tremendous concern. The widening gap between the rich and the poor, both within and across countries, can lead to social unrest and political instability. It is our responsibility to develop and implement inclusive and equitable economic policies that facilitate wealth redistribution, ensuring that all citizens can benefit from growth and prosperity. 3. Migration and Displacement: Currently, millions of people are in forced migration and displacement situations due to climate change, conflict, and socio-economic hardships. This crisis not only places immense strain on the countries hosting these individuals but also threatens the social fabric of these displaced communities. To address this challenge, we must implement comprehensive policies to address displacement root causes, support refugees and migrants, and facilitate successful integration into host countries. 4. Global Health: Global health remains a significant concern as new diseases and pandemics emerge. The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the impact of global health crises on economies, societies, and individuals. We must invest in robust health systems, promote international collaboration on medical research, and work towards providing universal healthcare coverage to achieve optimal health outcomes for all citizens. 5. Technological Advancement and Access: As the world becomes increasingly interconnected through technology, digital access has become essential for economic, educational, and social opportunities. However, a digital divide exists, particularly in underdeveloped and rural communities, where millions lack access to high-speed internet and advanced technologies. Closing this gap will require investment in digital infrastructure, promotion of digital literacy, and policies that ensure equal access to the benefits of technology. In conclusion, the Commission urges the heads of governments to engage in open dialogue, share best practices, and establish global partnerships to address the challenges that our community faces. We believe that by joining forces and fostering collaborative and inclusive approaches, we can create a more just, sustainable, healthy, and prosperous world for all. Let this declaration serve as the starting point for our collective actions, guided by our shared commitment to the well-being and advancement of the global community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The County of Loon was a province of the \\"ancien regime\\" Holy Roman Empire, lying west of the Meuse river in present-day Flemish-speaking Belgium, and east of the old Duchy of Brabant. The most important cities (\\"bonnes villes\\") of the county were Beringen, Bilzen, Borgloon, Bree, Hamont, Hasselt, Herk-de-Stad, Maaseik, Peer and Stokkem. Its territory corresponded closely to that of the current Belgian province of Limburg. Like other areas which eventually came under the power of the Prince Bishop of Liège, Loon did not become formally linked with the rest of Belgium until the French revolution, but these events also brought the county to an end. Under various new names it first became part of France, and then of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, before finally joining the new Kingdom of Belgium definitively in 1839. - Belgians are the citizens and natives of the Kingdom of Belgium, a federal state in Western Europe. - Bilzen is a town and a municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg. - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe.

Does the sentence \\"Meteorites from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the solar system; most are thought to come from asteroids, but some may have originated on larger planets.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is it about Antarctic meteorites that is different form meteorites found in other places?\\"","completion":"Though the sentence provided offers valuable information about meteorites from Antarctica, it does not fully address the particular differences between Antarctic meteorites and those found in other places. To answer the question, \\"What is it about Antarctic meteorites that is different from meteorites found in other places?\\" comprehensively, it is essential to delve deeper into the unique characteristics and aspects of the Antarctic meteorites. Antarctic meteorites are distinct from other meteorites for several reasons, including their abundance, preservation, and lower terrestrial contamination: 1. Abundance: Antarctica is a meteorite goldmine. About two-thirds of all meteorites ever discovered have been found in Antarctica. This is due to their concentration in certain areas where natural glacial movement carries them from the interior to the edges of the ice sheet, and extrudes them onto the surface. The ice's motion and slow ablation causes meteorites to accumulate in certain regions, such as the Transantarctic Mountains or blue ice fields. This greatly simplifies their recovery and allows for larger sample sizes, which can improve the reliability and validity of scientific research. 2. Preservation: The extreme cold and dry conditions of Antarctica help to preserve meteorites exceptionally well. Meteorites found elsewhere often suffer from weathering due to interaction with water, air, and other elements, which can alter their initial composition and make them harder to study. Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved due to the lack of liquid water and the stable temperatures, often in deep-freeze conditions. This allows researchers to examine the meteorites in almost the same state as when they fell to Earth. 3. Lower Terrestrial Contamination: Another considerable advantage of Antarctic meteorites is the reduction of terrestrial contamination. In most environments, chemical and biological contaminants can affect the composition and integrity of meteorite samples. In the harsh Antarctic conditions, however, the extremely low temperatures and lack of moisture, combined with the minimal human presence and biological activity, result in meteorites that are cleaner and less contaminated than those found elsewhere. 4. Diverse Range of Meteorites: Because ice movements can bring together meteorites from various locations in Antarctica, the diversity of meteorites found there is very high. This enables scientists to study a wide range of different meteorites, representing various origins and ages within the solar system. In summary, although the sentence about meteorites from Antarctica being important for studying materials formed early in the solar system holds educational merit, it does not specifically address the question about their unique qualities compared to meteorites found elsewhere. The significant distinctions of Antarctic meteorites include their abundance, exceptional preservation, lower terrestrial contamination, and their diverse range, which make them a valuable resource for understanding our solar system's history and the origins of our own planet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The U.S. military's first hybrid airship took off on its maiden voyage last week, hovering above New Jersey in a successful test flight. The Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle (LEMV), a hybrid blimp that has been in development for years, took off on August 7 - and stayed in flight for about 90 minutes. The vehicle is largely based on the Sky Cat, an advanced airship design refined over decades by British engineering firm Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd (HAV). Airtime: The LEMV hovered in the sky above Lakehurst, New Jersey, for about 90 minutes on August 7. While it gets its lift from the. lighter-than-air helium, multiple engines on board sustain flight and. allow it to move while gathering information from the ground. The helium-filled aircraft was conceived by a team of British and U.S. engineers with the goal of benefitting troops on the ground with valuable surveillance information. Based at Cardington in Bedfordshire, HAV is a specialist in hybrid air vehicles, which fly using a combination of aerostatic and aerodynamic lift. The team at Hybrid Air Vehicles has re-examined the basic principles behind Lighter-Than-Air Science and applied modern technology and materials to this 100 year old concept. The construction of the LEMV was a joint project between HAV and US defence firm Northrop Grummon. The radical reimagining of an airship has four propulsion units, and can be piloted into remote areas. 'Some ten years ago we built a 50 foot prototype and at some stage demonstrated this to a delegation of the US Department of Defence,' said HAV's Business Development Director Hardy Giesler. 'They were impressed and a few years later released a request for a long endurance surveillance vehicle, the requirements of which we are able to meet. 'Since surveillance programmes consist of multiple parts (vehicle as platform, a selection of sensors to provide the data and an ongoing service provision to manage & maintain the vehicle, as well as turn data into intelligence) we decided to team with Northrop Grumman.' The design can land on almost any surface - even snow capped mountains. The major new aircraft was built in just over 24 months since contract signature. Giesler told MailOnline that 80 per cent of the total cost of the vehicle was sourced in the UK. 'That is something Hybrid Air Vehicles is very proud of,' he added. The LEMV, which looks like a football but is as large as a football field, isn't your grandfather's military airship. The aircraft boasts a ton of high-tech gear to compliment the massive helium filled blimp, including sensors to beam information to troops on the ground, and to move heavy equipment. The airship is based on a design that could eventually be used around the world as a freight and passenger. It also has endurance, and can stay afloat above a battlefield or insurgent hotspot for up to 21 days - at a fraction of the cost of other military options. In a statement, the U.S. Army said the LEMV 'is intended to be used to conduct long-term intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or ISR, and persistent stare-type missions, and can also be used as a communications relay.' Developed by: Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd and Northrop Grummon. Top altitude: About 22,000 feet. Flight sustainability: Up to 21 days. Speed: About 92 miles per hour. The LEMV, which took off from New Jersey’s Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst base, was piloted for the test flight, but has the ability to function as an unmanned vehicle. It can float at an altitude of about 22,000 feet, and can travel at about 92 mph. The LEMV’s strong skin - a blend of Vectran, Kevlar and Mylar - can endure a reasonable amount of small arms fire from enemies on the ground. The construction of the LEMV was a joint project by British engineering firm Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd and U.S. defence firm Northrop Grummon. Lakehurst, where the LEMV took flight, is no stranger to airships. The base is also the site where the Hindenburg crashed in 1937. The Army says it will conduct more flights after the craft undergoes an inspection. Historic: Lakehurst, where the LEMV took flight, is no stranger to airships. The base is also the site where the Hindenburg crashed in 1937. Watch video here. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article are as follows: 1.

Movie title: Predators Movie plot: Royce (Adrien Brody) awakens to find himself parachuting into an unfamiliar jungle. He meets several others who arrived in the same manner: Mexican drug cartel enforcer Cuchillo (Danny Trejo), Spetsnaz soldier Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov), Israel Defense Forces sniper Isabelle (Alice Braga), Revolutionary United Front officer Mombasa (Mahershala Ali), death row inmate Stans (Walton Goggins), Yakuza enforcer Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien), and a general practice doctor Edwin (Topher Grace). Upon landing, they discover that all are armed and lethal killers, with the apparent exception of Edwin, though none know where they are or how they got there. The group follows Royce, who Isabelle suspects is a former black operations soldier turned mercenary. In the jungle they find empty cages, plants with a neurotoxic poison that Edwin collects on a scalpel, and a deceased US Special Forces soldier. Arriving at higher ground, they find themselves staring at an alien sky and realize that they are not on Earth. The party is attacked by a pack of quadruped alien beasts. Cuchillo is killed, and his body is then used as bait to lure the survivors into a trap, but they avoid it. Royce deduces they are on a planet used as a game preserve, where humans are hunted as game. The group follows the quadruped's tracks to a camp and find a captive Predator. The \\"hunters\\", three larger Predators, attack the group. Mombasa is killed and the rest of the group escapes. Isabelle reveals that she has heard of the Predators before, from a report by the only survivor (Major Alan \\"Dutch\\" Schaefer) of a Special Forces team who encountered one in Guatemala in 1987. The group next meets Noland (Laurence Fishburne), a lone soldier who has survived on the planet for \\"10 seasons\\" by hiding and scavenging from the Predators and their victims.

Summarize this article: For many in China it was a financial - and probably emotional - rollercoaster. And for those of us watching around the world, there's come the realisation that what goes on in the world's second biggest economy has a very real impact on our lives. We began the week with brand-new circuit breakers that did the exact opposite of what they were intended to do. Instead of calming investors, they caused them to panic, leading to the stock market shutting down twice in the space of the week. There was mayhem on regional markets, and panic ensued on bourses in the West too. But in the past 24 hours some relief. Thursday saw China's stock markets abruptly shut after 29 minutes of trading, the shortest trading day in its history. Then the circuit breakers were suspended and the yuan allowed to rise. That boosted sentiment and lifted Chinese shares, prompting other markets to go up too - initially. Problem solved? Not so fast. The structural problems within China's economy remain. And one of the key illustrations of that problem can be found in its currency, the yuan. The depreciation of the yuan earlier in the week is what in part caused sentiment to sour amongst investors, and the higher value of the currency this Friday, is what's brought back some sanity back to Chinese shares. So, what is it with the yuan? Here are three key things: The People's Bank of China sets the onshore midpoint rate for the yuan every day. It is meant to be a guiding rate for the way in which it wants the yuan to trade. For the last eight days running, it's allowed the yuan to depreciate. That caused many in the markets to speculate that China is trying to weaken its currency and export its way out of a slowdown. But some analysts say this isn't true and indeed the latest data suggests that Beijing has been intervening heavily to support its currency and drawing down on its reserves on a massive scale. This Friday, the currency's midpoint was set higher and that brought relief to investors, who see this as a sign that China won't allow the yuan to depreciate too quickly. But it's unlikely this problem will go away. The market has read the previous week's depreciation of the currency as an indication that China may be more willing to allow a weaker currency, and they'll keep putting pressure on the yuan as a result . How much the yuan is worth shouldn't really have much to do with the stock market. But the direction in which it trades certainly does show whether there's confidence in the economy. And as it weakens, more Chinese people and companies get concerned about its value, and buy more US dollars to ensure they won't be left hanging on to a cheaper Chinese currency - and selling the yuan to buy dollars weakens the yuan even further What all of this should tell you is that trying to manage the direction in which a stock market and a currency go is not only difficult, it can also backfire and end up in entirely the opposite result. The Chinese have managed a remarkable achievement - for the last 30 years a state controlled and state planned economic miracle that's seen incomes rise and wealth created on a historical scale. But China may have realised this week that trying to control its currency and stock markets may end up doing more harm than good. What a week it's been. Summary:","completion":"China's recent stock market turmoil has had far-reaching effects, demonstrating that the world's second largest economy has a considerable impact on our lives.

Math problem: Solve -765*g + 47*g + 3985 + 5349 = 0 for g. What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -765*g + 47*g + 3985 + 5349 = 0 for g, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. -765g and 47g are like terms since they both have the variable g. Add the coefficients of these terms together: -765g + 47g = (-765 + 47)g = -718g Now our equation looks like this: -718*g + 3985 + 5349 = 0 Step 2: Combine the constants. 3985 and 5349 are constants, so add them together: 3985 + 5349 = 9334 Now our equation looks like this: -718*g + 9334 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the variable g. To isolate g, we need to subtract 9334 from both sides of the equation: -718*g + 9334 - 9334 = 0 - 9334 This simplifies to: -718*g = -9334 Step 4: Solve for g. To solve for g, divide both sides of the equation by -718: -718*g / -718 = -9334 / -718 This results in: g = 12.99582 (rounded to five decimal places) So, the solution is g ≈ 12.99582."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the given text, the narrator talks about opening up a fortune cookie and reading the message inside it, which leads them to decide on trying something new, such as dyeing their hair. The act of opening a fortune and being influenced by it suggests that the narrator had recently consumed a meal at a Chinese restaurant, where they received the fortune cookie.

This assessment is based on the usage of specific phrases and the overall context it suggests. Let's break it down: The sentence implies 'a willingness to pay a considerable ransom'. In most contexts, the term 'ransom' is related to negative experiences. It is a form of compensation often associated with a crisis situation (like a kidnapping or hijacking) where money is demanded in exchange for the release of a person or precious item. The phrase 'not to be looking at' suggests a desire to avoid something. Therefore, the object or situation that they want to avoid must entail some unwanted, adverse, or undesirable experience. This again reinforces a negative feeling. Combine these together, and it suggests that this scenario is something unpleasant enough that someone would be willing to part with a significant sum of money just to avoid having to face it. Consequentially, people tend not to sacrifice resources such as money unless the situation is negative and strongly detrimental to them. Therefore, in the provided range, the number 1, negative, fits best for interpreting the sentiment of this sentence. This assessment, as stated earlier, is based on the particular phrases and their general usage in everyday conversation and literature. However, it's important to note that context can sometimes affect sentiment significantly, and without additional context, this interpretation is the most likely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sears has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy... (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday, buckling under its massive debt load and staggering losses. The question now is whether a smaller version of the company that once towered over the American retail landscape can remain viable or whether the iconic brand will be forced out of business. Sears, which started as a mail order catalog in the 1880s, has been on a slow march toward extinction as it lagged far behind its peers and incurred huge losses over the years. \\"This is a company that in the 1950s stood like a colossus over the American retail landscape,\\" said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consultancy. \\"Hopefully, a smaller new Sears will be healthier.\\" Others don't share Johnson's optimism. \\"That a storied retailer, once at the pinnacle of the industry, should collapse in such a shabby state of disarray is both terrible and scandalous in equal measure,\\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, in a note published Monday. \\"In our view, too much rot has set in at Sears to make it viable business.\\" The company has struggled with outdated stores and complaints about customer service even for its once crown jewels: major appliances like washers and dryers. That's in contrast with chains like Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Macy's, which have been enjoying stronger sales as they benefit from a robust economy and efforts to make the shopping experience more inviting by investing heavily in remodeling and de-cluttering their stores. Sears Holdings, which operates both Sears and Kmart stores, will close 142 unprofitable stores near the end of the year, with liquidation sales expected to begin shortly. That's in addition to the closure of 46 unprofitable stores that had already been announced. Edward S. Lampert, the company's largest shareholder, has stepped down as CEO but will remain chairman of the board. A new Office of the CEO will be responsible for managing day-to-day operations. The company said Monday it has secured 300 million in financing from banks to keep the operations going through bankruptcy. In addition, it's negotiating an additional 300 million loan from Lampert's ESL Hedge fund. The filing listed between 1 billion and 10 billion in assets while liabilities range between 10 billion to 50 billion. Sears joins a growing list of retailers that have filed for bankruptcy or liquidated in the last few years amid a fiercely competitive climate. Some, like Payless ShoeSource, successfully emerged from reorganization in bankruptcy court. But plenty of others like, Toys R Us and Bon-Ton Stores Inc., haven't. Both retailers were forced to shutter their operations this year soon after Chapter 11 filings. Given its sheer size, Sears' bankruptcy filing will have wide ripple effects on everything from already ailing landlords to its tens of thousands of workers. Lampert has been loaning out his own money for years and has put together deals to prop up the company, which in turn has benefited his own ESL hedge fund. Last year, Sears sold its famous Craftsman brand to Stanley Black & Decker Inc., following earlier moves to spin off pieces of its Sears Hometown and Outlet division and Lands' End. In recent weeks, Lampert has been pushing for a debt restructuring and offering to buy some of Sears' key assets, like Kenmore, through his hedge fund as a 134 million debt repayment came due on Monday. Lampert personally owns 31 percent of the company's shares, while his hedge fund has an 18.5 percent stake, according to FactSet. Sears' stock has fallen from about 6 over the past year to below the minimum 1 level that Nasdaq stocks are required to trade in order to remain on the stock index. In April 2007, shares were trading at around 141. The company, which once had 350,000 workers, has seen its workforce shrink to fewer than 90,000 people as of earlier this year. As of May, it had fewer than 900 stores, down from a 2012 peak of 4,000. In a March 2017 government filing, Sears said there was \\"substantial doubt\\" it would be able to keep its doors open — but insisted its turnaround efforts would mitigate that risk. Lampert pledged to return Sears to greatness by leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with a loyalty program. But losses continued and the company struggled to get more people through the doors or to shop online. Jennifer Roberts, 36, of Dayton, Ohio, was a long-time fan of Sears and has fond memories of shopping there for clothes as a child. But in recent years, she's been disappointed by the lack of customer service and outdated stores. \\"My mom had always bought her appliances from Sears. That's where my dad got his tools,\\" she said. \\"But they don't care about their customers anymore.\\" She said a refrigerator her mother bought at Sears broke after two years and still hasn't been fixed. \\"If they don't value a customer, then they don't need my money,\\" Roberts said. Sales at the company's established locations tumbled nearly 4 percent during its fiscal second quarter. Still, that was an improvement from the same period a year ago. Total revenue dropped 30 percent in the most recent quarter, hurt by continued store closings. \\"The problem in Sears' case is that it is a poor retailer,\\" Saunders wrote in an analyst note last week. \\"Put bluntly, it has failed on every facet of retailing from assortment to service to merchandise to basic shop keeping standards. Under benign conditions, this would be problematic enough but in today's hyper-competitive retail environment it is a recipe for failure on a grand scale.\\" For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s iconic catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. But the onset of discounters like Walmart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot. Store shelves have been left bare as many vendors have demanded more stringent payment terms, says Mark Cohen, a professor of retailing at Columbia University and a former Sears executive. Meanwhile, Sears workers are nervous about what kind of severance they'll receive if their stores close. John Germann, 46, works full-time and makes 14 per hour as the lead worker unloading merchandise from trucks at the Chicago Ridge, Illinois, store, which has been drastically reducing its staff since he started nine years ago. Germann now has only 11 people on his team, compared with about 30 a few years ago. \\"We're doing the job of two to three people. It's not safe,\\" he said. \\"We're lifting treadmills and refrigerators.\\" _____ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio ||||| CLOSE With Sears filing for bankruptcy and so many stores closing, the end may be drawing near for the iconic American retailer.

(Photo: Kelly Tyko, TCPalm via USA TODAY NETWORK) Corrections and Clarifications: An earlier version of this list incorrectly identified one Kmart location as a Sears. Sears Holdings plans to close another 142 unprofitable stores, as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy, on top of 46 store closings announced in August. Liquidation sales at the additional stores are expected to begin within two weeks, according to a court filing. \\"As we look toward the holiday season, Sears and Kmart stores remain open for business and our dedicated associates look forward to serving our members and customers,\\" Sears chairman Eddie Lampert said in a statement. The company has 687 stores remaining, including Kmart locations. It's possible more stores – even all stores – could end up closing if the company fails to reach a viable restructuring agreement in bankruptcy. The company has closed several hundred stores in recent years as it tries to stabilize its finances amid deteriorating sales. The most recent round, announced Aug. 23, involved plans to close 13 Kmart stores and 33 Sears locations in November.

Answer:","completion":"The City of Thi appears in the 10th book of the \\"Oz\\" series by L. Frank Baum, titled \\"Rinkitink in Oz.\\" The \\"Oz\\" series is a collection of 14 fantasy novels, the most famous of which is \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\\" originally published in 1900. The series features various characters who are inhabitants of the Land of Oz, a magical realm that includes multiple countries and cities. L. Frank Baum built a rich and imaginative world that is highly recognizable due to its colorful landscapes and memorable characters like Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion. \\"Rinkitink in Oz\\" was first published in 1916 and initially written as a stand-alone story intended to be separate from the Oz universe. Nonetheless, it was later revised by Baum to fit into the Oz series as its 10th novel. The story revolves around Prince Inga of Pingaree, King Rinkitink, and a talking goat named Bilbil, who embark on a journey to rescue Inga's parents after they are kidnapped by enemies. During their adventure, they come across the City of Thi. The City of Thi is an enchanted underwater metropolis located within the Nonestic Ocean, which surrounds the Land of Oz. Thi is inhabited by the Fearful People, who are invisible and have the power to transform outsiders into various objects. Prince Inga and King Rinkitink discover the city and its inhabitants as they seek guidance and assistance to rescue the captured Queen and King of Pingaree. In summary, the City of Thi is a significant setting in the 10th book of the \\"Oz\\" series, \\"Rinkitink in Oz.\\" The mysterious city introduces an enchanting underwater realm that expands the diverse and ever-evolving world of Oz, as experienced by generations of readers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Steven David \\"Steve\\" Levitt (born May 29, 1967) is an American economist known for his work in the field of crime, in particular on the link between legalized abortion and crime rates. Winner of the 2003 John Bates Clark Medal, he is currently the William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, director of the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He was co-editor of the Journal of Political Economy published by the University of Chicago Press until December 2007. With journalist Stephen J. Dubner, he co-authored the best-selling book Freakonomics (2005) and its sequels SuperFreakonomics (2009) See The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime for a detailed discussion of the issue. Revisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argued that the legalization of abortion can account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s. This paper has sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said \\"The numbers we're talking about, in terms of crime, are absolutely trivial when you compare it to the broader debate on abortion. From a pro-life view of the world: If abortion is murder then we have a million murders a year through abortion. And the few thousand homicides that will be prevented according to our analysis are just nothing--they are a pebble in the ocean relative to the tragedy that is abortion. So, my own view, when we [did] the study and it hasn't changed is that: our study shouldn't change anybody's opinion about whether abortion should be legal and easily available or not. It's really a study about crime, not abortion.\\" In 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt's results (\\"Did Legalized Abortion Lower Crime?\\" Journal of Human Resources, 2003, 38(1), pp. 1 -37.). In 2004, the authors published a response, in which they claimed Joyce's argument was flawed due to omitted-variable bias. In November 2005, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz, published a working paper, in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's abortion and crime paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors: the omission of state-year interactions and the use of the total number of arrests instead of the arrest rate in explaining changes in the murder rate. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it and did not affect property crime. They even concluded that the majority of women who had abortions in the 1970s were middle class whites rather than low income minorities as Levitt stated; this was, they stated, because white middle class women had the financial means for an abortion. The Economist remarked on the news of the errors that \\"for someone of Mr Levitt's iconoclasm and ingenuity, technical ineptitude is a much graver charge than moral turpitude. To be politically incorrect is one thing; to be simply incorrect quite another.\\" In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response, in which they admitted the errors in their original paper but also pointed out Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant, contrary to Foote and Goetz's claims. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and showed that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates. They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion.","completion":"This text is about Steven David \\"Steve\\" Levitt, an American economist known for his work in the field of crime, particularly focusing on the link between legalized abortion and crime rates.

(Associated Press) Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman is escorted to a helicopter in handcuffs by Mexican navy marines at a navy hanger in Mexico City, Saturday, Feb. 22, 2014. A senior U.S. law enforcement official said Saturday,... (Associated Press) Mexican marines working with U.S. authorities chased him but lost the man known as \\"Shorty\\" in a maze of tunnels under the city, a U.S. government official and a senior law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Sunday. It would be a short-lived escape for Guzman, who was captured early Saturday hiding out in a condominium in Mazatlan, a beach resort town on Mexico's Pacific Coast. He had a military-style assault rifle with him but didn't fire a shot, the officials said. His beauty queen wife, Emma Coronel, was with him when the manhunt for one of the world's most wanted drug traffickers ended. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss specific details of how U.S. authorities tracked down Guzman. For 13 years Guzman watched from western Mexico's rugged mountains as authorities captured or killed the leaders of every group challenging his Sinaloa cartel's spot at the top of global drug trafficking. Unscathed and his legend growing, the stocky son of a peasant farmer grabbed a slot on the Forbes' billionaires' list and a folkloric status as the capo who grew too powerful to catch. Then, late last year, authorities started closing in on the inner circle of the world's most-wanted drug lord. Bit by bit, they got closer to the crime boss. Then on Feb. 16, investigators from Mexico along with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Marshal Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement caught the break they badly needed when they tracked a cellphone to one of the Culiacan stash houses Guzman used to elude capture. The phone was connected to his communications chief, Carlos Manuel Ramirez, whose nickname is Condor. By the next day Mexican authorities arrested one of Guzman's top couriers, who promptly provided details of the stash houses Guzman and his associates had been using, the officials said. At each house, the Mexican military found the same thing: steel reinforced doors and an escape hatch below the bathtubs. Each hatch led to a series of interconnected tunnels in the city's drainage system. The officials said three tons of drugs, suspected to be cocaine and methamphetamine, were found at one of the stash houses. An AP reporter who walked through one of the tunnels had to dismount into a canal and stoop to enter the drain pipe, which was filled with water and mud and smelled of sewage. About 700 meters (yards) in, a trap door was open, revealing a newly constructed tunnel. Large and lined with wood panels like a cabin, the passage had lighting and air conditioning. At the end of the tunnel was a blue ladder attached to the wall that lead to one of the houses Mexican authorities say Guzman used as a hideout. A day after troops narrowly missed Guzman in Culiacan, top aide Manuel Lopez Ozorio was arrested. The officials said he told investigators that he picked up Guzman, Ramirez and a woman from a drainage pipe and helped them flee to Mazatlan. A wiretap being monitored by ICE agents in southern Arizona provided the final clue, helping track Guzman to the beachfront condo, the officials said. The ICE wiretap proved the most crucial lead late last week as other wiretaps became useless as Guzman and his associates reacted to coming so close to being caught. \\"It just all came together and we got the right people to flip and we were up on good wire,\\" the government official said. \\"The ICE wire was the last one standing. That wire in Nogales. That got him (Guzman) inside that hotel.\\" Alonzo Pena, a former senior official at ICE, said wiretaps in Arizona led authorities to the Culiacan house of Guzman's ex-wife, Griselda Lopez, and to the Mazatlan hotel where Guzman was arrested. The ICE investigation started about a year ago with a tip from the agency's Atlanta office that someone was crossing the border with about 100,000 at a time, said Pena, who was briefed on the investigation. That person led investigators to another cartel operative, believed to be an aircraft broker, and that allowed them to locate Guzman's communications equipment. The senior law enforcement official said the Mexican marines deserve credit for taking Guzman alive and without either side firing a shot. \\"We never anticipated, ever, that he would be taken alive,\\" the official said. It is not yet clear what will happen next to Guzman, except that he will be the focus of a lengthy and complicated legal process to decide whether Mexico or the U.S. gets to try him first. In Mexico, he is likely to face a host of charges related to his role as head of the Sinaloa cartel, which is believed to sell cocaine, marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine in some 54 countries. Grand juries in at least seven U.S. federal district courts, including Chicago, San Diego, New York and Texas, have already issued indictments for Guzman on a variety of charges, ranging from smuggling cocaine and heroin to participating in an ongoing criminal enterprise involving murder and racketeering. Federal officials in Chicago were among the first to say they wanted to try Guzman. On Sunday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Tiscione in Brooklyn became the second. In an email Sunday, Tiscione said his office would also be seeking extradition but it would be up to Washington to make the final call. A Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because it's a matter of sensitive diplomatic discussions, said decisions regarding extradition have not been made. When Guzman was finally in handcuffs, the man who eluded Mexican authorities for more than a decade looked pudgy, bowed and middle-aged in a white button-down shirt and beltless black jeans. Now 56, he had been on the run since escaping from prison in 2001 in a laundry truck. During those 13 years, Guzman was rumored to live everywhere from Argentina to Mexico's \\"Golden Triangle,\\" a mountainous, marijuana-growing region straddling the northern states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua. Under his leadership, the Sinaloa Cartel grew deadlier and more powerful, taking over much of the lucrative trafficking routes along the U.S. border. His undoing started late last year as authorities on both sides of the border arrested people close to Guzman and one of his two top associates, Ismael \\"Mayo\\" Zambada. This month federal forces began sweeping through Culiacan, capital of the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa. They closed streets, raided houses, seized automatic weapons, drugs and money, and arrested a series of men that Mexican officials carefully described to reporters as top officials for Zambada. On Feb. 13, a man known as \\"19,\\" whom officials called the new chief of assassin for Zambada, was arrested with two other men on the highway to Mazatlan. Four days later, a man described as a member of the Sinaloa cartel's upper ranks was seized along with 4,000 hollowed-out cucumbers and bananas stuffed with cocaine. In the middle of last week, a 43-year-old known by the nickname \\"20\\" and described as Zambada's chief of security, was arrested transporting more cocaine-stuffed produce. By the middle of the week at least 10 Sinaloa henchmen had been seized. The final strike came when marines closed the beachside road in front of the Miramar condominiums, a 10-story, pearl-colored building with white balconies overlooking the Pacific and a small pool in front. Smashing down the door of an austerely decorated fourth-floor condo, they seized Guzman a few minutes after the sun rose. ___ Associated Press writer Alicia A.

Joaquin \\"Shorty\\" Guzman is being escorted by soldiers during a presentation at the Navy's airstrip in Mexico City February 22, 2014. REUTERS/Henry Romero Guzman, who long ran the feared Sinaloa Cartel and was Mexico’s most wanted criminal, was caught on Saturday in his native northwestern state of Sinaloa with help from U.S. agents. It was a major victory for the Mexican government in its fight against powerful drug gangs and for the cause of cooperation between Mexican and U.S. security forces. The phone that helped lead to Guzman’s downfall belonged to the son of his deputy, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who could now be in line to take over from his boss. The break came when Zambada’s son, Serafin Zambada-Ortiz, was arrested in November trying to cross the border from Mexico into the United States, where he faced sealed drug charges. “This was one of several important turning points. But it was critical,” the official said. A lawyer for Zambada-Ortiz, Michael McDonnell of La Habra, California, said no data from his client’s phone or other electronics led U.S. authorities to Guzman. “He didn’t know him ... His father did,” McDonnell said. “I don’t know where you’re getting your information but Serafin Zambada had no connection to Guzman’s arrest, period.” U.S. prosecutors said on Sunday they plan to seek the extradition of Guzman to face trial in the United States. Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Brooklyn, New York, said his office would request Guzman’s extradition to face a variety of charges. A spokesman for the Mexican attorney general’s office declined to comment on the extradition request. President Enrique Pena Nieto’s office also declined to comment. Sensitivities over the issue could mean Guzman is more likely to face justice first in Mexico, where he still has an outstanding term to finish. He broke out of prison, reportedly in a laundry cart, in 2001. The United States had a 5 million bounty on Guzman’s head. His cartel has smuggled billions of dollars’ worth of cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine into the United States, and fought vicious turf wars with other gangs across Mexico. ELECTRONIC TRAIL Zambada-Ortiz, who is a U.S. citizen, entered the United States at Nogales, Arizona, to take care of a visa matter for his wife, the U.S. official said. He apparently did not know that he was facing sealed cocaine and methamphetamine charges in San Diego when he crossed the border. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested him and seized his phone. The Drug Enforcement Administration then compared the numbers in the phone with a database of more than 1 billion records, which includes information collected by subpoena, search warrants and arrests during other drug investigations. The DEA also receives information on Mexican cartel telephone and email data from the U.S. National Security Agency, but U.S. officials declined to say whether the NSA played a role in the case. “We handled this case like we handled many: using technology to work up the chain, person by person, to the top,” the U.S. official said. Last week, that trail led them to some of Guzman’s senior henchmen but the drug boss himself narrowly escaped, using a network of tunnels and sewers to give his pursuers the slip. Guzman, 56, was eventually captured on Saturday in a pre-dawn raid on a seaside condominium in the northwestern tourist resort and fishing and shrimp-processing center of Mazatlan, 135 miles from Guzman’s suspected base in Culiacan. “This is the biggest success in the drug war in 20 years, and shows that contrary to what you hear in the press, behind the scenes the U.S. and Mexico have been working well together,” said the U.S. official. In addition to facing U.S. criminal charges in Chicago and New York, Guzman was indicted in 2007 in Miami for cocaine smuggling with additional charges added last month. Guzman also was charged in 2012 in Texas with importing cocaine and marijuana, money laundering, firearms violations and running a criminal enterprise that included murder. More than 80,000 people have been killed in Mexico’s drugs war over the last seven years with much of the violence in western and northern regions that have long been smuggling routes. Many of the victims are tortured and beheaded and their bodies dumped in public places or in mass graves. The violence has ravaged border cities and even beach resorts such as Acapulco. ||||| Before dawn this month, a convoy of Mexican marines quietly surrounded a house in the Spanish colonial city of Puebla and arrested an alleged drug trafficker also wanted for questioning over the kidnapping of a Mexican politician. Little did the marines know then, but his capture would become a vital piece of the puzzle that would help Mexican and U.S. officials several days later to nab the world's most sought after drug lord,... |||||Summary:","completion":"Mexican drug lord Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman was captured by authorities in a hideout at a high-rise condominium in Mazatlan, Mexico. Guzman, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, had managed to evade authorities for years with a combination of advanced technology, escape tunnels, and connections within the criminal underworld. The series of events leading up to his capture began when authorities arrested one of his top couriers and tracked a cellphone to a stash house. Though escaping the initial raid, more information and a wiretap led to his discovery. The capture of Guzman is significant for both the Mexican government's fight against drug cartels and for the cooperation between Mexican and U.S. security forces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: The show, premiering with two episodes Wednesday night, is a horrifying and yet strangely sweet glimpse at American life as it is lived by a particular style of Americans that television finds increasingly irresistible, and yet: “We are not rednecks,” claim the family’s older daughters, even as they prepare to spend their day at a redneck pride festival that features bobbing for pigs’ feet, mudhole belly-flop contests and overweight women clad in Confederate-flag bikinis. This is a show about seemingly dumb people who are in fact quite smart, starting with Alana (a.k.a. Honey Boo Boo) herself, whom fans of the network’s popular “Toddlers & Tiaras” have already met. Alana was an overnight hit when she first appeared on the show in January; with this spinoff, TLC is simply admitting that they — and we — are captivated by Honey Boo Boo. Just point the camera at her and let it roll. Alana has been raised to express herself in the urban patois of reality TV’s black women. Nearly every utterance includes a head swivel, a sassy snap or an “oh-no-she-din’t.” It’s a funny and deeply disturbing tangle of cultural cues, as this chubby little white girl essentially performs a 21st-century version of minstrelsy. By finding Alana hilarious and egging her on, her family and her viewers are participating in a complicated, multilayered, possibly benign display of latent racism that could keep linguistics professors and social scientists busy for decades. Curiously, the people at TLC seem to believe that Alana and her family need subtitles in order to be understood — something I see increasingly on reality shows in which the subjects have a thick accent of any sort, not just foreign, whether it’s Southern, Latino, street urban or even New Englander. Are we really so incapable as a viewing public of comprehending people who aren’t from our neck of the woods? (Is our incessant babble leading us back to Babel?) If this series were a documentary or someone’s dissertation, perhaps we could go there. As it is, “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” is mishandled raw data, in which a working-class family amps up its drawling, strutting nature for the camera’s benefit. You’ll blow a gasket if you watch this show with any trace of superiority or outrage. Instead, bafflement is a good resting spot; a guilty-pleasure glee works even better. Living in a little house by the railroad tracks of McIntyre, Ga., the family members do what they can to make ends meet. Mike (“Sugar Bear”), 40, works “seven days a week” mining chalk, while Mama June, a 32-year-old, 309-pound force of nature, trims the family budget by hoarding rolls of toilet paper and other nonperishables through extreme couponing — another facet of TLC’s world. (“Now you are going to pick every one of them up,” June bellows after Honey Boo Boo tips over a plus-size jug of puffed cheese balls.) Alana describes her three teenage sisters — nicknamed Pumpkin, Chickadee and Chubbs — as “the craziest,” “the pregnanciest” (!) and “my BFF.” You could hire all the comedy writers you want and still not come up with more ludicrous sitcom characters — and anyhow, all the comedy writers would have gone to Ivy League schools. Their conception of such folk would be just as stereotypical and somehow not nearly as true. “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” eventually turns to its real franchise, as June and other obsessed moms drag their children to various chain hotel meeting rooms for pay-as-you-go weekend beauty pageants, where their little princesses get dolled up like Pamela Anderson and preen for the judges. Once more we journey into that seriously uncomfy JonBenet Ramsey milieu — a vulgar pageant scene virtually unchanged by decades of sophisticated disapproval and satire. Hopped up on iced coffee, Pixy Stix and Mountain Dew, Alana has difficulty concentrating on her routine, fails to win a trophy and bursts into tears. And yet she remains a champion in her own mind. “Win or lose,” she tells the camera, “you’re still good.” Here Comes Honey Boo Boo (two 30-minute episodes) premieres Wednesday at 10 p.m. on TLC.","completion":"\\"Embracing the Chaos: The Fascinatingly Unusual World of Honey Boo Boo and Her Unapologetic Family\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The duo were disappointed with their performance, particularly Garfunkel, who felt that he sang poorly. Simon said that he did not immediately realize the magnitude of the event: \\"I didn't get what had happened – how big it was – until I went home, turned on the television and saw it on all the news ... and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers. Then I got it.\\"In May 1982, Simon & Garfunkel went on a world tour with stops in Japan, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Great Britain, New Zealand, the US and Canada. The European leg of their tour began on May 28, 1982, at the Stadion am Bieberer Berg in Offenbach am Main. This was their first performance in Germany, and had an attendance of around 40,000 spectators.When they were not on the road, the duo went into the studio to work on what was to be a reunion Simon & Garfunkel album, tentatively entitled Think Too Much, with Garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which Simon had already laid down some backing tracks. They set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned North American tour, but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements, Simon told Warner Brothers he could no longer work with Garfunkel and that the project as an S&G album was cancelled. Thus Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which then became Simon's November 1983 solo album Hearts and Bones.Several years would pass before Simon & Garfunkel worked together again. Their next joint public appearance was in 1990, when they performed for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. When Simon gave another free concert in Central Park on August 15, 1991, he rejected Garfunkel's offer to participate. However, they agreed to perform together in 1993 for 21 sold out concerts in New York, with half of the show being Paul Simon solo with a band and the other half Simon and Garfunkel.

What team holds the contract for the former team captain of the Union Dutchmen?","completion":"The Union Dutchmen refers to Union College's ice hockey team, which competes at the NCAA Division I level. When you mention the former team captain, it is essential to note that this position rotates, and there have been multiple captains in the history of the Union Dutchmen. To generate a detailed and long answer, I will provide information on a prominent former team captain who has had success in professional hockey. As of August 2021, one of the notable former team captains is Mike Vecchione. He served as a team captain during the 2016-2017 season, during which he made significant contributions to the team's success. Vecchione is an American ice hockey player who played for the Union College Dutchmen from 2013 to 2017. Born on February 25, 1993, in Saugus, Massachusetts, Vecchione is a skilled forward who demonstrated remarkable leadership qualities during his college career. Post his college stint, Vecchione was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Philadelphia Flyers in the National Hockey League (NHL) on March 31, 2017. He made his NHL debut on April 4th, 2017, against the New Jersey Devils. With signing a contract with the Philadelphia Flyers, Vecchione's professional ice hockey journey began. However, as players' contracts evolve and they move to different organizations, it is possible that they may no longer be associated with their former team. In July 2019, Vecchione signed a one-year, two-way contract with St. Louis Blues, another NHL team. Subsequently, he spent the majority of the 2019-2020 season with the San Antonio Rampage, the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate of the St. Louis Blues at that time. Considering the changes that frequently transpire on professional athletes' contracts and affiliations, it is essential to look up the latest available information to confirm their current team association. Therefore, it would be best to search for the latest information on Vecchione's contract and the team he is affiliated with should you need the most recent information. Since there are multiple former team captains, you can also search for another former team captain of the Union Dutchmen using a similar approach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - You breathe oxygen into your body through the nose or mouth - The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe - The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the blood stream - The carbon dioxide in the blood stream is transferred to the air sacs - The lungs expel through the nose or mouth back into the environment. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less acid dissolves nutrients happens, how will it affect less carbon dioxide will be transferred to the air sacs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided is related to the acid content affecting nutrient dissolution, which seems to be more relevant to the digestive system and nutrient absorption rather than the respiratory system and the exchange of carbon dioxide. However, we can explore the potential impact on the respiratory system if certain assumptions are made. Let's assume that the decrease in acid content (for example, in the blood) affects the ability of hemoglobin to bind and transport both oxygen and carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Under this assumption, if less acid dissolves nutrients, it might lead to an altered blood pH level, which could negatively affect hemoglobin's ability to bind with carbon dioxide. Consequently, less carbon dioxide would be transferred to the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, leading to a reduced efficiency in expelling carbon dioxide from the body. Also, the lower acid content can indirectly contribute to lower cellular respiration rates, as the nutrients from food play a critical role in energy production. If nutrient absorption decreases, it may impact the overall cellular energy metabolism and subsequently affect carbon dioxide production. However, it is essential to note that the perturbation hypothesis appears to focus on nutrient dissolution rather than the respiratory process itself. So, while the connections outlined here are based on certain assumptions, the direct link between the proposed perturbation and the respiratory process might not be strong."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Good Mic, eh software Product review: I recently bought the Samson CO1U mic for recording vocal and guitar tracks to create demo MP3s of my music. The mic works well enough, but the software it comes with is rather difficult to use. It somewhat resembles a mixing board, but has a strange way of doing some things. This wouldn't be a big deal for podcasters, but would for anyone trying to do multitrack recordings.As a side note, the stand that it comes with is tiny and barely holds the mic upright when plugged in. It can't hold the mic with the shock-mount; it falls over instantly. Buying the Podcasting pack (includes shock-mount and beefier stand) is worth the extra money. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"This review depicts the product in a somewhat unflattering light. While the reviewer acknowledges that the Samson CO1U mic works well for recording vocals and guitar tracks, they express dissatisfaction with the accompanying software's difficulty and usability, particularly for multitrack recordings.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - In physics, gravitational acceleration is the acceleration on an object caused by the force of gravitation. Neglecting friction such as air resistance, all small bodies accelerate in a gravitational field at the same rate relative to the center of mass. This equality is true regardless of the masses or compositions of the bodies. - The kilogram or kilogramme (SI unit symbol: kg) is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI) (the Metric system) and is defined as being equal to the mass of the \\"International Prototype of the Kilogram\\" (IPK, also known as \\"Le Grand K\\" or \\"Big K\\"). - An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Commercial aviation is a massive industry involving the flying of tens of thousands of passengers daily on airliners. Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled. - The International System of Units (; abbreviated as SI) is the modern form of the metric system, and is the most widely used system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F. - Miniature dachshunds have a typical weight of 8 to 11 pounds in the United States . They also are normally a height of 5 to 7 inches at the withers . They are nicknamed \`\` wiener dogs '' , \`\` hot dogs '' or \`\` sausage dogs '' . - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). - Altitude or height (sometimes known as depth) is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, and many more). As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or \\"up\\" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage. - Height is the measure of vertical distance, either how \\"tall\\" something is, or how \\"high up\\" it is. For example \\"The height of the building is 50 m\\" or \\"The height of the airplane is 10,000 m\\". When used to describe how high something like an airplane or mountain peak is from sea level, height is more often called altitude. Height is measured along the vertical (y) axis between a specified point and another. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations. - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars and the stars to group together into galaxies so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects. - Mean sea level (MSL) (abbreviated simply sea level) is an average level of the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured. MSL is a type of vertical datuma standardised geodetic reference pointthat is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured in order to calibrate altitude and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. - In science and engineering, the weight of an object is usually taken to be the force on the object due to gravity. Weight is a vector whose magnitude (a scalar quantity), often denoted by an italic letter \\"W\\", is the product of the mass \\"m\\" of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration \\"g\\"; thus: . The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a body can be weightless only if it is far away (in principle infinitely far away) from any other mass. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).

Dot blames herself for her father's death in a car accident, believing that if she had been with him, she could have warned him of the oncoming danger. Soon after arriving, Dot discovers an incestuous relationship between Nina and her father, Paul (Martin Donovan). Paul invited Dot to stay in an attempt to control himself, wishing he could end the sexual relationship between him and his daughter. He tries to tell his wife Olivia (Edie Falco) about his relationship with Nina, but is unable to bring himself to say it. \\"Life sucks, Dot. I feel like I can tell you this.

About 400 high school students from Western Pennsylvania and the neighboring state of Ohio joined a heated discussion recently on \\"China: What Does the Future Hold?\\" \\"It's either going to turn out really good or really bad - who knows?\\" said Braveen Ragunathan, a senior from an Ohio high school. In his mind all Americans are connected to China in some way. The forum was held in Pittsburgh, once a US industrial center, now facing job-cuts because of competition brought about by globalization. The aim of the forum is to help American students learn more about the outside world. Elliott Blackwell, a junior at the Neighborhood Academy, said the forum let him know more about how China's economic development will affect America in the future. Some students, although impressed by China's economic boom, expressed uneasiness about the nation's practices and differences from the American way of doing business and politics. \\"China is a power coming up,so they might challenge us,\\" Paul Amon, a junior from Oil City High School, said. \\"I'd hope that China can be our partner but I think that we'd clash along the way because we're too different,\\" he added.

His famous series of sixteen great designs for the Apocalypse is dated 1498, as is his engraving of St. Michael Fighting the Dragon. He made the first seven scenes of the Great Passion in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints. The Seven Sorrows Polyptych, commissioned by Frederick III of Saxony in 1496, was executed by Durer and his assistants c. Around 1503-1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the Life of the Virgin, which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the Great Passion, were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers. During the same period Durer trained himself in the difficult art of using the burin to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the Prodigal Son, which the Italian Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably Nemesis (1502), The Sea Monster (1498), and Saint Eustace (c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as Pond in the Woods and Willow Mill, are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. He made a number of Madonnas, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures.

Read this article and answer this question The screening suggests that in 2000, 19 percent of all newborn babies in Metropolitan France had at least one parent originating from one of the risk regions. The figure for 2007 was 28.45 percent, for 2010 31.5 percent, for 2012 34.44 percent, for 2013 35.7 percent, and for 2015 38.9 percent. These percentages vary widely among French regions; for example, in 2015, screening suggested that only 8.1% of children born in Brittany had a parent originating from a sickle-cell risk region, while 73.4% of children born in Île-de-France (which includes Paris) did. The percentage for Île-de-France was a significant increase from 54.2% in 2005. However, a 2014 story in Le Monde suggested that the testing figures for Île-de-France were distorted by the practices of some hospitals in the region, which choose to test all babies whether or not they have parents with ancestry from an endemic sickle-cell region. How many percent increase was seen between 2000 and 2007 of at least one parent of babies born in Metropolitan France originating from one of the risk regions?","completion":"Okay, let me explain it simply. In the year 2000, there were 19 percent of babies with at least one parent from a risk region. Then, in 2007, it increased to 28.45 percent. To find the increase in percentage, subtract the old number from the new number. So, 28.45 minus 19 equals 9.45. That means there was a 9.45 percent increase between 2000 and 2007 for babies with at least one parent from a risk region in Metropolitan France."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is a stodgy teacher of Latin, disliked by his pupils, who call him Mr. Chips. Chips meets Katherine Bridges, a music hall soubrette, in the dining room of the Savoy Hotel in London on the eve of his summer holiday. Dissatisfied with her career and depressed by her romantic entanglements, she sets sail on a Mediterranean cruise and is reunited with Chips by chance in Pompeii. Seeing in him a lonely soul similar to herself, she arranges an evening at the theatre after they return to Britain, and the two find themselves drawn to each other. When Chips arrives at Brookfield for the autumn term, it is with his new wife on his arm, much to the shock of the staff and delight of the pupils, who find Mrs Chips' charm to be irresistible. Although her close friend and confidante Ursula Mossbank helps Katherine thwart Lord Sutterwick's plan to deprive the school of a generous financial endowment because of the woman's background, her past eventually deprives Chips of his longheld dream of being named headmaster in 1939. Still, the couple's devotion to each other overcomes all obstacles threatening their marriage, extending through 20 years together, when Katherine is killed in 1944 by a German V-1 flying bomb while entertaining the troops at a local Royal Air Force base. Too late for his wife to share in his happiness, Chips was picked as headmaster of Brookfield that same day, and lives out his years at the school, loved by his pupils and comforted by his happy memories.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that revealed locations that had similar sites to the one that academics wanted to include in a joint commission? from the following article ? During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.

Answer:","completion":"Robin can be described as an individual with a strong affinity for the sport of basketball, indicating that they likely enjoy watching matches, playing the game, or discussing the sport with others who share the passion. This shared interest with Jordan highlights their ability to connect with people based on their common hobbies, making them approachable and sociable. It is the mutual love for basketball that becomes the foundation of their bond with Jordan and contributes to the growth of their friendly relationship. Robin's basketball interest can be attributed to the sport's fast-paced, dynamic nature, which might suggest that they are an active and competitive person who likes to stay engaged in exciting pastimes. Given the physical nature of basketball and its demands on a player's stamina, coordination, and skill, we can infer that Robin is most likely dedicated to maintaining a consistently fit lifestyle, which may also extend to other aspects of their life. Furthermore, basketball is a sport known to cultivate teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills in order to secure a win for the team. These qualities likely reflect on Robin's personality, making them a good team player who is adept at collaborating with others and effectively addressing issues that arise. This ability to work well in a group setting might indicate that Robin is receptive to ideas and opinions of others, often prioritizing the collective success rather than solely focusing on personal achievements. As basketball is a widely popular sport with several significant figures like Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant, Robin's interest might also be fueled by an admiration for the skill and talent displayed by these professional players. In this context, we might surmise that Robin appreciates perseverance, determination, and the level of commitment required to succeed both in sports and in life. In summary, Robin can be described as a sociable and active individual who shares a passion for basketball with Jordan. This shared interest reveals their competitive nature, dedication to fitness, and strong teamwork skills.

Many individuals with oily skin struggle with excess oil, large pores, and a shiny appearance. This can lead to self-consciousness and a lack of confidence in one's appearance. Fortunately, there are several steps that can be taken to minimize these issues and improve the overall appearance of oily skin. In this article, we will explore the importance of exfoliating, using the right moisturizer, applying sunscreen, and incorporating face masks into your skincare routine for optimal results. 1. Exfoliate Your Skin: Regular exfoliation is an essential step in maintaining healthy and radiant skin, especially for those with oily skin. Exfoliating helps to remove the buildup of dead skin cells, which can lead to clogged pores, acne, and an uneven complexion. By gently scrubbing your skin with an appropriate exfoliating product, you help reveal a smoother and more radiant complexion while preventing further breakouts and minimizing excess oil production. When choosing an exfoliator, be sure to select one designed for oily skin types. These products will typically contain ingredients like salicylic acid or alpha hydroxy acids, which help to break down dead skin cells and unclog pores. It is recommended that individuals with oily skin exfoliate twice a week to maintain optimal results. However, be cautious not to over-exfoliate your skin, as this can lead to irritation and increased oil production. 2. Use a Moisturizing Lotion Intended for Oily Skin: Individuals with oily skin may be hesitant to use a moisturizer for fear of exacerbating their skin issues. However, even oily skin requires hydration to maintain its health and radiance. By skipping this step, you may inadvertently cause your skin to produce even more oil to compensate for a lack of moisture. The key here is to choose a moisturizer specifically formulated for oily skin types. These lightweight products will typically have a non-comedogenic formula, meaning they won't clog your pores. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid and niacinamide, which help regulate oil production and reduce the appearance of large pores, are often found in moisturizers intended for oily skin. Remember to apply your moisturizer daily, preferably in the morning and evening, to ensure your skin stays hydrated and healthy. 3. Remember to Apply Sunscreen: Sun protection is vital for all skin types, including oily skin. Failing to protect your skin from harmful UV rays can lead to premature aging, sunspots, and an increased risk of skin cancer. While it may feel counterintuitive to apply a product that feels greasy on your already oily skin, there is a wide range of sunscreens available that cater specifically to oily skin types. Look for sunscreens with a matte finish, oil-free or non-comedogenic formulas, and broad-spectrum protection with an SPF of 30 or higher. Applying sunscreen should be the last step in your morning skincare routine, after you've cleansed, exfoliated, and moisturized. Be sure to reapply throughout the day, especially if you're spending time outdoors or swimming. 4. Improve Your Face's Appearance by Using a Face Mask: Incorporating face masks into your skincare routine is a fantastic way to give your skin a little extra care and attention. For those with oily skin, clay or charcoal masks are highly recommended due to their ability to draw out impurities and excess oil from the skin. These types of face masks work by absorbing excess sebum while also gently exfoliating the skin. In addition to clay and charcoal masks, individuals with oily skin can also benefit from sheet masks that contain ingredients like tea tree oil, witch hazel, or green tea. These ingredients have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which can help calm any existing breakouts while also regulating oil production. Using a face mask once or twice a week can help maintain a clearer, more balanced complexion without causing any additional irritation or dryness. Conclusion: Managing oily skin can be a challenging process. However, with the right combination of exfoliation, moisturizing, sun protection, and face masks, you can improve your skin's overall appearance and maintain a more balanced complexion. Remember that everyone's skin is unique, and it may require some trial and error to find the best combination of products for your specific needs. With consistency and patience, your oily skin can be well-managed and radiant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Fact 1: Most canyons are formed by flowing rivers through erosion over long periods of time. Fact 2: Rivers contain 0.001 percent of the earth's water. Given the two facts above, what are most canyons caused by? A:","completion":"Most canyons are primarily caused by a combination of various geological processes, with the primary factor being the erosive action of flowing rivers over long periods of time. This process, known as fluvial erosion, refers to the gradual removal and transportation of rock material and sediments by the continuous flow of water in river channels. Along with the erosion caused by rivers, other geological processes such as weathering, tectonic uplift, and mass wasting can contribute to the formation of canyons. Rivers play a crucial role in shaping the earth's landscapes, as noted in Fact 1. They can cut deep and narrow valleys through the Earth's crust, resulting in the formation of spectacular canyons. Due to their flowing nature, rivers possess immense energy which they utilize to erode the earth's bedrock, carving the land over millions of years. Over time, the intensity of a river's erosive action intensifies as the river cuts deeper into the bedrock, causing the valley to become steeper and narrower. This gradual process of erosion is what contributes largely to the creation of most canyons. Despite only containing a small percentage (0.001%) of the Earth's total water supply, as highlighted in Fact 2, rivers continuously transport and distribute water across vast areas on the planet, contributing significantly to the formation of distinct landforms such as canyons. It is essential to recognize that even though rivers constitute a tiny fraction of Earth's water resources, their influence on the planet's geological features should not be underestimated, as evident in the creation of most canyons. In conclusion, given the two facts above, the majority of canyons are formed by the prolonged erosive action of flowing rivers. Alongside fluvial erosion, other geological processes like weathering, tectonic uplift, and mass wasting contribute to the formation of canyons. Although rivers contain a minuscule percentage of the Earth's water, their vital role in shaping landscapes, particularly canyons, is substantial and undeniable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Revenue grew 24 per cent to Rmb20.98billion, slightly higher than forecasts, driven mainly by online gaming revenues. It is unclear how much WeChat contributed to Tencent's revenues but the app's growth is a strong indicator of the company's long-term health as it tries to adjust its business to be more suitable for mobile devices. \\"We extended our leadership in games and online media, and made breakthroughs in emerging platforms such as online security . . . and mobile payments,\\" Ma Huateng, Tencent chairman, said in a statement. WeChat is the second highest ranked app in China, behind QQ, Tencent's other chatting app, which claimed to have 815m registered monthly users at the end of 2014. However, that figure is more than the total number of internet users in China, which the government puts at 640million. Tencent has been unwilling to earn money through WeChat by flooding it with advertising, which could reduce efforts to increase the user base. But this is expected to change. Some analysts predicted that advertising would be introduced on later this year. Early attempts to test ads on the service have not always gone smoothly.

The police suspect it to be the work of a serial killer who is picking up homosexual men at West Village bars like the Eagle's Nest, the Ramrod, and the Cock Pit, then taking them to cheap rooming houses or motels, tying them up and stabbing them to death. Officer Steve Burns (Al Pacino), who resembles the victims, is sent deep undercover by Captain Edelson (Paul Sorvino) into the urban world of gay S&amp;M and leather bars in the Meatpacking District in order to track down the killer. He rents an apartment in the area and befriends a neighbor, Ted Bailey (Don Scardino), a struggling young gay playwright. Burns's undercover work takes a toll on his relationship with his girlfriend Nancy (Karen Allen), due to both his refusal to tell her the details of his current assignment and Burns building a close friendship with Ted, who himself is having relationship problems with his jealous and overbearing dancer boyfriend Gregory (James Remar). Burns mistakenly compels the police to interrogate a waiter, Skip Lee (Jay Acovone), who is intimidated and beaten to coerce a confession before police discover Skip's fingerprints don't match the killer's.

(CNN) -- In spite of heightened security due to a terror threat on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks, a South Carolina man was apparently able to sneak a stun gun into a professional football game and fired it into the crowd, police said Tuesday.

Movie plot title: Suspect Movie plot: Set in Washington DC, Suspect centers on three disparate characters. Carl Wayne Anderson is a homeless, deaf-mute Vietnam veteran accused of murdering Elizabeth Quinn, a file clerk at the Justice Department. Kathleen Riley is the beleaguered Federal Public Defender assigned to represent Anderson. An agribusiness lobbyist who normally works on Capitol Hill, Eddie Sanger, is made a member of the jury and begins investigating the details of the murder himself, eventually teaming up with Riley to solve the case. We see some early scenes of Sanger's work as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, including his efforts to win passage of a bill by seducing a Congresswoman. While not relevant to the movie's plot, these scenes are establishing shots giving us a sense for Sanger as a charming, though somewhat ruthless, person.The movie begins around Christmas with the suicide of a United States Supreme Court Justice, for which no explanation or context is given. We only see the Justice making a tape recording and then shooting himself. Shortly after the Justice's suicide, Elizabeth Quinn's body is found floating in the Potomac river, and Carl Wayne Anderson is arrested for the crime, based almost entirely on the fact that he was found sleeping in Quinn's car, which was abandoned in the parking lot where she worked (and was mostly deserted at night). Anderson explains that he found it unlocked and was just looking for a warm place to sleep since it was the dead of winter. But since he was homeless, had no alibi, and was found in Quinn's car, he was arrested for her murder. The establishing scenes show Riley trying to communicate with Anderson and realizing that he is a deaf-mute.

You will remember the name of Garibaldi, the Italian patriot, who with Mazzini had been stirring up trouble for the Austrians. They finally pursued him so closely that he had to leave Italy. He came to America and set up a fruit store in New York City, where there were quite a number of his countrymen. By 1854, he had made a great deal of money in the fruit business, but had not forgotten his beloved country, and was anxious to be rich only in order that he might free Italy from the Austrians. He sold out his business in New York, and taking all his money, sailed for Italy. When the war of 1859 broke out, he volunteered, and fought throughout the campaign. But the compromising terms of peace galled him, and he was not satisfied with a country only half free. In the region around Genoa, he enrolled a thousand men to go on what looked like a desperate enterprise. Garibaldi had talked with Cavour, and between them, they had schemed to overthrow the kingdom of the Two Sicilies and join this land to the northern country. Of course, Cavour pretended not to know anything about Garibaldi, for the king of Naples and Sicily was supposed to be a friend of the king of Sardinia. Nevertheless, he secretly gave Garibaldi all the help that he dared, and urged men to enroll with him.

First, look at this math problem: 82*q = 83*q - 2 2. Our goal is to find out what 'q' is. 3. To do that, let's focus on the 'q' part in both sides of the equation. Notice that we have 82*q on one side and 83*q on the other side? 4. We want to make both sides equal, so we are going to subtract 82*q from both sides to cancel out the q on the left side. So, it will look like this: 82*q - 82*q = 83*q - 82*q - 2 5. When we subtract, it will look like this: 0 = 1*q - 2 (because 83*q - 82*q = 1*q) 6. Now, we want to isolate 'q'. To do that, we have to get rid of the -2. To cancel out the -2, we add 2 to both sides: 0 + 2 = 1*q - 2 + 2 7. When we add, it will look like this: 2 = 1*q (because -2 and +2 cancel out) 8.

Maybe it just took a while for the message to sink in. It’s been five weeks since Garry Monk told Jonjo Shelvey that the problems in his head were close to cancelling out the game-changing talent in his feet. The word he used was ‘lazy’; the message was that if Shelvey kept trundling around the pitch collecting thoughtless yellow cards then Swansea would soon lose patience with a player who ran out of time at Liverpool. On Sunday, his talent came up with a delayed reaction, the midfielder hitting a brilliant strike from 25 yards with seven minutes remaining. The goal came from nowhere — and so did the win — for a side that rarely finds rewards on the road. Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey unleashes a stunning strike to open the scoring against Southampton on Sunday afternoon. Shelvey's effort flew past Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster as Swansea recorded their first Premier League win in over a month. Former Liverpool midfielder Shelvey celebrates after scoring the only goal of the game in the 83rd minute at St Mary's.

This was Swansea’s first away win against Southampton since 1953, when they were known as Swansea Town. Monk spoke of a ‘spot-on’ game-plan to let Southampton hog possession before a late onslaught. Ronald Koeman’s view was more in keeping with most others here, that his side enjoyed ‘total domination’ and should have won. How costly this sucker punch could be to Southampton’s bid to storm the top four. This was not a game they should have lost, nor a fixture they had cause to fear. Swansea’s pre-match tally of Premier League away wins was two. There ought to be perspective, though. Southampton had so many injuries they could not fully stock their bench. And their defence, the tightest in the top flight, was only breached by a sublime goal. But the concern, quite aside from Ryan Bertrand’s straight red card for a horrible late foul on Modou Barrow, should be how possession was not turned into goals. These are opportunities Koeman knows cannot be missed. Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand catches Swansea substitute Modou Barrow with a high challenge late in the game. Bertrand argues with Swansea manager Garry Monk after being shown a straight red card by referee Michael Oliver. Summer signing Barrow is carried from the field on a stretcher with defender Jordi Amat replaceing him in added time. Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne (left) competes for the ball with Swansea winger Nathan Dyer during the opening period. Swansea youngster Jay Fulton (right) clears the ball under pressure from Saints midfielder James Ward-Prowse. ‘It is difficult to keep our position in the table and we know that,’ he said. ‘We have to be very good in each game and if our players are not at their best it is more difficult. ‘We can expect teams like Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool to win games as they are big teams with good players. The position, even after this defeat, is not normal for Southampton — but we keep going. I’m frustrated because I don’t think we deserved to lose. We played very well in the first 45 and had total domination. In the second half we had less control but the lucky team won. That’s football.’ On Bertrand’s foul, which led to Barrow leaving the pitch on a stretcher, Koeman did not share the common view that such a high tackle merited a red card. He said: ‘In my opinion it is not a red card. In my opinion these fouls are yellow.’ Barrow will be ‘fine’, according to Monk, who added: ‘I thought it was a bad tackle. I’m not sure it was a red card. It is the momentum that made it look bad.’ For Monk, this was a happy homecoming to a club that employed him for eight years before his time at Swansea. He is currently experiencing his first adverse moments in the dugout, having seen Wilfried Bony sold to Manchester City and his side winless in the league since Boxing Day coming into this game. For long spells here, this looked like another miserable away day. James Ward-Prowse shot straight at Lukasz Fabianski after seven minutes and Dusan Tadic miscued a volley later in the half. By the time Shelvey pounced, Southampton had taken more than 65 per cent of the possession. Even then there was time for Sadio Mane to have two shots cleared off the line by Ashley Williams. Ryan Bertrand (second from right), on loan from Chelsea, directs a shot over Lukasz Fabianski's crossbar in the first half. Southampton striker Graziano Pelle (centre) holds off a challenge from Swansea defender Federico Fernandez. Swansea goalkeeper Fabianski launches himself into the air to punch a cross away from the head of Southampton's Dusan Tadic. Former Liverpool midfielder Shelvey (right) attempts to block a long ball forward from Saints captain Fonte. Swansea skipper Ashley Williams (right) gets himself in front of Southampton loanee Eljero Elia inside the visitors' penalty area. Defender Bertrand is sent crashing to the ground after a challenge during a goalless opening period at St Mary's. Monk said: ‘It has been a difficult month for us for various reasons — losing players, injuries, suspension. But we went back to basics. We executed a game-plan. ‘I knew we were against a very good side in the Champions League spots. The plan was to concede possession, frustrate them and then when the crowd gets frustrated they would look for a goal. We wanted to use the ball in those moments and what a great strike. Tactically we got it spot on.’ Koeman might view it as more of a missed opportunity.

Swansea midfielder, Jonjo Shelvey, scored a brilliant strike from 25 yards out against Southampton, giving Swansea their first Premier League win in over a month. The victory was also their first away win against Southampton since 1953. 2. Garry Monk, Swansea's manager, praised his team's plan to let Southampton keep possession before launching a late offensive surge. Despite opinion to the contrary, Monk referred to the strategy as 'spot-on'. 3. Swansea's win came as a blow to Southampton, who was dominating the game with more than 65% possession and should have won according to their manager, Ronald Koeman. 4. In the aftermath of the game, a major concern for Southampton was how they could maintain possession but not convert it into goals. 5. During the game, Ryan Bertrand from Southampton was given a straight red card for a high-tackle foul on Modou Barrow from Swansea, a decision that has sparked debates. 6. The game was a positive return for Monk to his former club and a relief from the recent winless run in the league. 7. Both teams had their fair share of challenges, with Southampton battling injuries and a depleted bench, while Swansea had recently lost key player Wilfried Bony to Manchester City."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1: In the event of a funding cut, there is no way we would be able to pick it up, said L. Tracy Brown, executive director of the center. Sentence 2: Tracy Brown was worried that if the funding cut was steep enough, the center might have to close. Both sentences express Tracy Brown's concern about a funding cut. However, Sentence 1 explicitly states that they wouldn't be able to pick up the funding, while Sentence 2 only says Tracy Brown is worried about the possibility of the center closing due to a steep funding cut. Based on this comparison, the correct answer is: (2). it is not possible to tell.

Write a sentence that is about a restaurant with all the following properties: name = The Waterman, food = English, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = 1 out of 5, area = city centre Sentence:","completion":"The Waterman is an English cuisine restaurant located in the heart of the city centre, known for its moderately priced menu; however, it has largely disappointed its clientele and has only managed to secure a stunningly low customer rating of 1 out of 5. Despite its prime location and the promise of an authentic English dining experience, The Waterman has not lived up to its potential and the expectations of its customers. It offers a wide range of traditional English dishes, but the consistently poor reviews suggest that the quality, taste, and presentation of the food fail to justify the cost, even though it falls in the moderate price range. Furthermore, diner reviews reveal that the issues do not end with the food; there is consistent feedback about the poor service, unsatisfactory cleanliness, slow response times, and lacklustre ambiance, all of which have significantly contributed to the lacklustre 1-star customer rating. This is a stark contradiction to the ambiance and dining experience one would expect from a restaurant situated in such a bustling and vibrant city centre. Despite getting a lot of footfall due to its strategic location, The Waterman has faced substantial difficulty in requisitioning a loyal consumer base. The low customer rating clearly indicates a need for immediate and substantial improvements in service, food quality, and overall management for The Waterman to boost its popularity and redeem its reputation in the city's competitive food industry. This observation serves as a reminder that while location and cuisine type are critical components to a restaurant's success, the ultimate key is in delivering high-quality food and service that meet the expectations of the customer. For The Waterman, these improvements could potentially drive an increase in customer ratings, solidifying it as a go-to spot for English food in the city centre, rather than remaining as a restaurant with a seemingly pervasive 1 out of 5 rating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A child who has once been pleased with a tale likes, as a rule, to have it retold in almost the same words, but this should not lead parents to treat printed fairy stories as formal texts. It is always much better to tell a story than read it out of a book, and, if a parent can produce what , in the actual situation of the time and the child, is an improvement on the printed text, so much the better. A change made against fairy tales is that they harm the child by frightening him or making him sad thinking. To prove the latter, one would have to show in a controlled experiment that children who have read fairy stories were more often sorry for cruelty than those who had not. As to fears, there are, I think, some cases of children being dangerously terrified by some fairy story. Often, however, this arises from the child having heard the story once. Familiarity with the story by repetition turns the pain of fear into the pleasure of a fear faced and mastered. There also people who object to fairy stories on the grounds that they are not objectively true, that giants, witches, two-headed dragons, magic carpets, etc. do not exist; and that, instead of being fond of the strange side in fairy tales, the child should be taught to learn the reality by studying history. I find such people, I must say so peculiar that I don't know how to argue with them. If their case were sound, the world should be full of mad men attempting to fly from New York to Philadelphia on a stick or covering a telephone with kisses in the belief that it was their beloved girl-friend.

During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: \\"For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them.

What is the best way to: how to make amatriciana with clams","completion":"Making Amatriciana with clams is relatively simple, but requires some variations from the traditional Amatriciana sauce. Here's a step-by-step guide for preparing the dish. Ingredients: - 400g pasta (spaghetti or linguine) - 400g canned crushed tomatoes (or fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped) - 200g pancetta (or guanciale), diced - 1 medium onion, finely chopped - 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced - 1 tsp red pepper flakes (adjust according to your liking) - 1/2 cup white wine - 1 kg fresh clams, cleaned and scrubbed - Salt and pepper, to taste - 2-3 tbsp olive oil - Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnishing) - Grated Pecorino Romano cheese (optional) Steps: 1. Prepare all ingredients: Having all your ingredients ready before preparing the dish is essential. Start by chopping the onion, mincing the garlic, dicing the pancetta, and cleaning the clams. Step justification: This prevents any delay while cooking, ensuring that all ingredients are at the right temperature when adding them to the dish. 2. Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, following the package instructions. Drain and set aside. Step justification: Cooking the pasta separately ensures that it doesn't become overcooked while you are preparing the sauce and clams. 3. Prepare the sauce: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook until crispy. Remove the pancetta and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate. Step justification: Frying pancetta first helps release its fat, which will add flavor to the sauce, and also creates crispy bits for added texture. 4. In the same skillet, add the onion and cook until softened and slightly golden. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Step justification: Cooking onions first softens them and adds sweetness, while cooking garlic and red pepper flakes with onions prevents burning and adds flavor. 5. Stir in the canned crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Cook the sauce over low heat for 10-15 minutes to allow flavors to meld and develop. Step justification: Simmering the sauce cooks out any raw tomato taste and helps to infuse flavors from the other ingredients. 6. Cook the clams: In a separate pan, heat a little olive oil over medium heat. Add the clams, white wine, and a pinch of salt. Cover and cook until the clams open, around 5-7 minutes. Discard any unopened clams. Step justification: Cooking the clams separately in white wine infuses them with flavor and ensures they cook evenly. 7. Combine everything: Once the sauce is ready, gently fold the cooked clams and their juices into the sauce. Add the cooked pasta and pancetta to the sauce, and toss everything together to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. Step justification: Combining all ingredients ensures that the flavors meld, creating a cohesive and delicious Amatriciana with clams dish. 8. Taste and adjust seasoning: Add salt and pepper to taste. Step justification: Adjusting seasoning ensures that the final dish is balanced and flavorful. 9. Serve and garnish: Plate the pasta and sauce, garnishing with freshly chopped parsley and grated Pecorino Romano cheese, if desired. Step justification: Garnishing the dish with parsley adds a pop of color and fresh flavor, while the cheese adds a salty, savory touch. Enjoy your Amatriciana with clams!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve -4*h = -13*h + 27 for h.","completion":"Alright, little buddy, we're going to play with some numbers. Imagine you're dividing your candies with your friends, trying to make it fair for everyone. So, we have -4*h equals -13*h plus 27. In kid talk, let's say we gave 4 candies to one friend each hour (that's -4*h), and we gave 13 candies to another friend, but then we found 27 candies (so -13*h plus 27). Now, let's bring the candies we gave to the second friend (-13*h) to the side where we gave the first friend candies (-4*h). We can take the candies from one friend and give them to the other. This won't change the total amount of candies; it just moves them around. So, now the equation will look like this -4*h + 13*h, which equals to 27. In our candy language that's like saying the first friend now has 9 of their candies each hour (because -4 +13 = 9), and we still have the 27 candies we found. We're just moving the candies we've already given out. So, the next step is to find out how long we'd need to keep giving out 9 candies per hour before we've given out all 27 candies. We do this by taking the 27 candies we have and dividing them by the 9 candies we give out each hour. So, h (which represents the hours) becomes 27 divided by 9, which is equal to 3.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more residents did Roskilde have in 1970 than it did in the 1900s?","completion":"Title: A Historical Analysis of the Population Growth in Roskilde: A Comparison between the 1970s and the 1900s Introduction Roskilde, a bustling city located in eastern Denmark, has experienced significant changes in its population size over the past century. Known for its cultural vibrancy, picturesque setting, and rich history dating back to the Viking era, this charming Danish city has seen a fascinating growth in its population numbers. This article delves into the quantitative aspect of population growth in Roskilde, comparing the number of residents in the city in 1970 to that in the 1900s, and it seeks to understand the factors that contributed to this increase. Population Growth: Comparing the 1970s and the 1900s The population of Roskilde saw a remarkable increase over the latter half of the 20th century. In the early 1900s, the city was home to roughly 8,000 residents. Nevertheless, by 1970, the population soared to approximately 40,000 inhabitants. This translates to a staggering increase of 32,000 residents in just seven decades. Numerous factors contributed to the city’s population growth during this period, including economic development, urbanization, and improvements in living standards. Economic Development and Urbanization One of the primary drivers of Roskilde's population expansion was the city's economic development and urbanization during the 20th century. As Denmark underwent a period of transformation from an agricultural to an industrialized nation, many rural dwellers were drawn to cities like Roskilde for enhanced job prospects and better living conditions. By the 1960s, Roskilde had evolved into an industrial and commercial hub, with a booming economy and an increasingly diverse range of job opportunities. Consequently, people moved to the city from rural areas in search of better livelihoods. Furthermore, the geographic advantages of Roskilde, such as its proximity to the nation's capital, Copenhagen, made the city an ideal destination for both employment and residential purposes. Improvements in Living Standards Progress in urban planning, architecture, and public infrastructure, such as housing, schools, and healthcare facilities, also played a significant role in attracting new residents to Roskilde. The efficient public transportation system and well-maintained road networks of the city helped foster a transportation revolution, enabling more people to move to Roskilde and facilitating commuting and traveling. Moreover, post-World War II reconstruction aided in improving the living conditions across Denmark. Increased investments in social welfare policies, including healthcare, education, and housing, contributed to a superior quality of life for the city's inhabitants and attracted new dwellers in search of better prospects. Innovation and Education Roskilde's reputation as a prominent center for learning and innovation also boosted the city's overall desirability. The establishment of Roskilde University in 1972 helped attract both local and international students and led to an influx of highly educated individuals who were drawn to the city for its academic excellence and research opportunities. As a result, a knowledge-based economy began to thrive in Roskilde, contributing to further economic growth and innovation. This laid the foundation for a synergistic relationship between the city's burgeoning population and continued advancements in science, technology, and various other sectors. Conclusion In summation, the population growth of Roskilde in the 20th century can be attributed to the complex interplay of various factors, including economic development, urbanization, improvements in living standards, and a focus on innovation and education. The city has experienced a remarkable increase in residents, adding an astonishing 32,000 individuals between the 1900s and 1970s. As Roskilde continues to grow and develop, the importance of understanding and accommodating the needs and well-being of its population remains paramount to the city's ongoing success and prosperity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs Question: \\"What organization redistributed its funding based on census counts in Ohio and Michigan?\\" Answer: \\"LSC\\" Is this answer correct? Possible answers: (1). no; (2). yes;...I think the answer is","completion":"(2). yes; The answer is correct.

Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] and the situation: Twenty first century is seeing an explosion of artificial island building. Many countries are building islands in the middle of seas and oceans, which they often use for tourism or for defensive purposes. For example, UAE had build several islands in the Persian Gulf. To build those islands they had to ask Oman and Qatar to export sand to them. Qatar declined to export sand, but Oman agreed. Oman in turn had to mine huge quantity of sand in their own country. Answer the following question: As a result of sand mining, Would Qatar's fisheries earn more money or less money than Oman's fisheries? Answer:","completion":"As a result of sand mining, Qatar's fisheries would likely earn more money than Oman's fisheries. This is because sand mining can cause significant harm to local marine life, including disruption of underwater habitats and destruction of fisheries. Since Qatar declined to mine and export sand, their fisheries would likely face less disturbance and remain more sustainable, whereas Oman's fisheries could suffer negatively due to the environmental impacts of sand mining."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: (SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy \\"actioner\\" (and I use the term loosely) that I've been trying to watch for over a year.

In an effort to save two hours of your life I'm going to tell you he plot- a guy who has the ability to project a long blade out of his arm returns home to see his mom. Things turn ugly after he is beaten up by the mafia boyfriend of an old girl friend. He takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home. The guys mafia mom sends her men out to get revenge while the cops begin looking for him as well. Very little is said. no explanation is really given for anything (like why they lock id girlfriend in an asylum) and the action, for the most part is all off screen. The film essentially consists of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody looking intense and not saying anything, killing people (off screen-most of the action happens off screen). It looks good, is well acted and had there been some form of reason for what is going on it might have been a good film. Hell, I would have liked some sense of real character development or back story (all we know is that the guy was picked on as a kid).

Justice is the legal or philosophical theory by which fairness is administered. The concept of justice differs in every culture. An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his work \\"The Republic\\". Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, theorists like John Locke argued for the theory of natural law. Thinkers in the social contract tradition argued that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 19th century, utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill argued that justice is what has the best consequences. Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the \\"proper\\" distribution. Egalitarians argued that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. John Rawls used a social contract argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like Robert Nozick) take a deontological view of distributive justice and argue that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with punishment for wrongdoing. Restorative justice (also sometimes called \\"reparative justice\\") is an approach to justice that focuses on restoring what is good, and necessarily focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.

Please briefly summarize this news article: IMF Cuts Global Growth Forecast, Warns of Stagnation Risk The International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast for the fourth time in the past year on Tuesday, citing China’s slowdown, persistently low oil prices and chronic weakness in advanced economies. The Fund, whose spring meetings along with the World Bank will be held in Washington this week, forecast that the global economy would grow at 3.2 percent in 2016 compared to its previous forecast of 3.4 percent in January. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the Fund warned of widespread stagnation risk and said weaker growth could leave the global economy more vulnerable to shocks such as currency depreciations or worsening geopolitical conflicts. The Fund called on global policymakers attending the IMF and World Bank meetings to take coordinated actions to boost demand with structural economic reforms, fiscal stimulus where possible and accommodative monetary policy. “Lower growth means less room for error,” IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said in a statement. “Persistent slow growth has scarring effects that…reduce potential output and with it, demand and investment.” The IMF cut Japan’s growth forecast in half to 0.5 percent in 2016 and said Brazil’s economy would now shrink by 3.8 percent this year versus the previous forecast of a 3.5 percent contraction as it struggles through its deepest recession in decades. Meanwhile, the United States, one of the relative bright spots in the global economy, also saw its 2016 growth forecast cut to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent. The IMF said it anticipated an increased drag on U.S. exports from a stronger dollar, while low oil prices would keep energy investment weak. The Fund raised China’s growth forecast slightly to 6.5 percent this year, and 6.2 percent in 2017, partly due to previously announced policy stimulus. But the IMF said it still expects China’s growth to continue to weaken as it transitions to a consumer-driven economy. “A sharper slowdown in China than currently projected could have strong international spillovers through trade, commodity prices, and confidence, and lead to a more generalized slowdown in the global economy, especially if it further curtailed expectations of future income,” the IMF said in the World Economic Outlook. The new forecasts follow previous growth markdowns in July, October and January. Obstfeld said that global growth could easily weaken from the latest IMF forecasts which could reinforce a deflationary spiral of weak growth that erodes future output potential. He said this phenomenon is known in some economic circles as “secular stagnation.” He also noted that persistently lower growth could reinforce a sense of economic inequality and encourage nationalistic, protectionist policies, particularly in the euro area, which could also reduce potential.","completion":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut its global growth forecast for the fourth time in the past year, citing China's economic slowdown, low oil prices and weakness in advanced economies.

You can have a lot of fun here, especially on holidays. There are many festivals in Australia. The most important one is obviously Christmas. Each year, the summer holidays at every high school last about two months from the beginning of December to February, which covers the Christmas time. Since it is a long holiday, most overseas students love to fly back to their home countries to spend the time with their families and friends, but a few students still stay in Australia during the holiday to get part-time jobs. It is quite easy to find a part-time job at Christmas. Students often take part in another major social activity. They go to the beach to have fun in the sunshine. The summer in Australia is from December to February, so going to the beach in December is very popular among Australians. Easter in March is another important holiday in the year. It actually combines \\"Good Friday\\" and \\"Easter Monday\\". Almost every shop closes on Good Friday. And people usually go to see Easter Show.

This diverse country offers plenty to see and do, particularly during the holidays. Australia plays host to various festivals and celebrations throughout the year, with Christmas being the most significant one. As Australia is located in the southern hemisphere, the summer season occurs from December to February, which coincides with the end of the academic year. High schools usually have a long summer break lasting about two months, stretching from early December to February. This period covers Christmas, making it an exciting time for overseas students to explore Australian culture or spend time with their families and friends back home. Despite the allure of returning to their home countries, some students choose to stay in Australia during the holiday season. They often find part-time jobs, which can be easier to secure during Christmas due to increased demand for temporary workers in retail, hospitality, and other sectors. With its warm summer weather, Australia's beautiful beaches become a major attraction in December. High school students take advantage of the sunny days by heading to the coast for a fun and relaxing time. This is a popular activity among Australians and overseas students alike, providing opportunities to socialize and enjoy outdoor activities. Another notable holiday in Australia is Easter, which takes place in March and comprises both Good Friday and Easter Monday. Many businesses close on Good Friday, and Australians typically attend the Easter Show or engage in other festive activities. However, since the Chinese New Year is not a public holiday in Australia, Chinese students must continue with their normal school routine and responsibilities during this time. In conclusion, the correct answer is C) December, as that is when the summer holidays begin for high school students in Australia. This festive season offers overseas students a wealth of opportunities to explore Australian culture and traditions, forge friendships, and make lasting memories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Sometimes life gets a little dull. What used to be fun and different becomes boring. That is the time to look for something new. It is the time for a big idea to get your mind off everyday life. So why not search for extraterrestrial intelligence? Or even better, why not get your computer to do it for you? Over two million people have joined the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence(SETI)project. Based in California, the SETI project analyzes information taken from a giant radio telescope based in South America. Its task is to look for signals from outer space that might prove that life exists on other planets. Processing this information is far too big a job for one computer. So the SETI project workers divide the work among volunteers who visit their website. Each computer gets some information to work out from the SETI network through the Internet. This process is often known as \\"meta-computing\\". It is a wonderful thought. You are sleeping, eating a meal or going out with friends. All this time, your computer is searching the stars for signs that might show something is out there trying to get in touch. Volunteers are proud of being involved in the SETI project. It shows that they understand the potential of computing. They know that it is more than just a way of working or playing games. Meta-computing may also be creating intelligence as well as looking for _ . This idea is based on the theory that human intelligence is created by the way in which different parts of the brain communicate with each other.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Good punches are efficient punches, transferring power to your opponent with grace and ease. While you should work on training your speed and endurance, better technique will always lead to a better boxer. While doing the following drills, focus on: Leading with your elbow. Think of throwing your elbow at your opponent, not your wrist. Staying compact. You don't want to flail or move your body unnecessarily. Keep your non-punching hand close and your legs sturdily underneath you. Letting your arms rest and move during breaks. When you're not punching, leave your arms loose, or \\"breathing,\\" so that they rock comfortably with your body. Don't try and clench and hold them rigidly-- it will only tire you out faster. . Speed bags hang from the ceiling and require you to develop a strong, consistent rhythm to your punches. You hit with a regular, circular motion, keeping your hands and the bag moving. This is one of the best ways to build your endurance, connection, and coordination with your hands. Run the speed bag for 3-5 3-minute sessions, resting 30 seconds between each interval. The heavy bag ( the enormous hanging bag for punch training) is going to become your best friend. You want to hit it for 3-5 minutes, punching like you would in a fight. However, make sure you're not just standing there trying to hit. Stay on the balls of your feet, keep moving like in a real fight, and stop occasionally to duck, dodge, and block, like you would in a real fight. In general, the more like the real thing you can make it, the better the workout will be. For a more tiring workout, give the bag a swing before beginning. This forces you to focus in on a moving target. Using a heavy bag, take 30 seconds to throw as many punches as you possibly can. Focus on speed, not power, as you throw the punches. After 30 seconds, rest for 30 seconds and then repeat 4-5 more times. You can choose to lift or simply use you body weight to build muscle. No matter what your style, mix in 2-3 days of strength training every week, cutting down to 1 on fight weeks. Luckily, boxing is so muscle intensive that you will be making gains each time you spar, fight, or shadowbox as well, so strength training should not be the focus of your workouts. Aim for big, multi-muscle exercises to build the most muscle the fastest. Some good exercises to try include: Body weight: If you can't go to the gym, are under 16 years old, or just would rather not lift weights, there are plenty of great exercises to try: Push-ups, close-handed and wide stance. Dips Do front and side planks. Try body-weight rows, or inverted rows. Pull-ups and chin-ups. Weight lifting: Focus on smooth, fluid technique. You want to move both up and down with control for the safest, best results. Rows, seated and standing Bench press Shoulder raises and flies Bicep curls. A great tool for beginners, slow sparring takes all of your work into the ring for a safe, technique focused exercise. It is just like normal sparring with a partner, but you want to throw punches at 75% of your normal speed. This is the best way to work up your opposite hand, focus on techniques or moves that you don't have down yet, and build up confidence in the ring. Since you have to react to a live fighter, even at a slow pace, this is a great way build essential skills. Focus on coordination -- follow through on your punches, keep your feet moving, and focus on hand positioning in all circumstances. All of your body parts should be moving in concert with one another.","completion":"This article provides tips for improving boxing technique by focusing on efficiency, recommending drills such as using speed and heavy bags, incorporating strength training, and slow sparring, while emphasizing coordination and proper body mechanics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How to plant vegetable seeds outdoors Choose the types of vegetables you would like to grow and purchase the vegetable seeds to plant. This will allow you to become familiar with how to plant vegetable seeds outdoors and enjoy the varieties you select once harvest time arrives. Learn about the types of vegetable seeds you are going to plant.","completion":"After learning about the types of vegetable seeds you are going to plant, the next steps include: 1. Assessing your garden space: Before you start planting, measure your gardening area, and determine the amount of space available. This is important to know as different vegetables require specific amounts of space, sunlight, and soil conditions to thrive successfully. 2. Testing and preparing the soil: Perform a soil test to determine the quality of your garden's soil. This will give you an idea of any necessary soil modifications for the specific vegetables you want to grow. Once you know the soil requirements, you can amend the soil by incorporating compost, organic materials, or fertilizers to enhance drainage, structure, and nutrient content. 3. Understanding the growing seasons: Familiarize yourself with the growing seasons of the vegetable seeds you've chosen. Certain vegetables grow better in specific seasons, such as warm-weather crops (e.g., tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers) and cool-weather crops (e.g., lettuce, spinach, and broccoli). Planting your vegetables at the right time ensures optimal growth and yield. 4. Planning your layout: Develop a planting layout that considers the spacing, light, and watering requirements of each vegetable variety. Some prefer close planting, while others need more breathing room. Also, consider companion planting, which involves grouping plants that benefit each other, like providing shade, pest control, or nutrient supplementation. 5. Planting the seeds: Once the planning stage is complete, you can start planting the seeds. Dig shallow holes or rows following the recommended spacing, and depth guidelines on the seed packets. Carefully place the seeds in the holes/rows, and cover with a thin layer of soil. Pat the soil gently to eliminate air pockets. 6. Watering and care: Provide adequate water to your newly planted vegetable seeds. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Pay attention to the specific watering needs of each vegetable type as some may require more or less frequent watering. 7. Pest control and protection: Monitor your garden regularly for pests and diseases that can harm your vegetables. Implement preventative measures such as companion planting, natural repellents, or physical barriers to minimize pest damage. If necessary, use organic or chemical pesticides, following their guidelines to prevent damage to your crops. 8. Weed management: Keep your garden free of weeds by regularly removing any that may appear. Weeds compete with your vegetable plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight, which can affect their growth and overall health. 9. Fertilizing: Ensure your vegetables receive the nutrients they need throughout the growing season. Based on the specific requirements, you may need to apply additional fertilizers or soil amendments to boost their growth and productivity. 10. Harvesting: Once your vegetables have grown and matured, it's time to harvest and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Research the ideal harvesting times and methods for each vegetable type to maximize your yield and avoid damaging the plants. By following these steps, you'll be able to successfully plant vegetable seeds outdoors, watch them thrive, and ultimately enjoy a bountiful harvest. Remember to adapt and modify your gardening practices based on your climate, soil, and local environmental conditions for best results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Step 4: Think of the most appropriate response for the listener based on the general assumption that they would want to maintain a positive relationship with the person apologizing. In this case, a likely response would be accepting the apology and addressing the issue. Listener: Thank you for apologizing. Accidents happen.

Answer the following question: What is the worst result of smoking? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - looking cool - lung disease - bad breath - pleasure - death Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the options given. - looking cool: This option seems to describe a positive outcome of smoking, not a negative one. - lung disease: This option describes a negative health outcome that can be caused by smoking. - bad breath: This option describes a negative, but relatively minor, result of smoking. - pleasure: This option seems to describe a positive outcome of smoking, not a negative one. - death: This option describes the most serious negative outcome that can result from smoking. Step 2: Determine which of the negative outcomes is the worst result of smoking. Lung disease is certainly a negative outcome, and it can have serious consequences on an individual's health. Bad breath, while unpleasant, is not nearly as significant as the other negative options. Death, however, is the most extreme consequence that can result from smoking. Step 3: Choose the most suitable option to answer the question.

OPTIONS: 1). parasites. 2). contamination. 3). cigarettes. 4). Leptospirosis. 5). Smoking. 6). Pesticides. 7). heat or cold. 8). acetic acid. Answer:","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"Anorexia can be caused by\\" appears to be: 1). parasites. The teacher mentioned that \\"roundworms may be free-living or parasitic\\" and that \\"roundworms can cause anorexia.\\" This statement specifically implicates parasites as a possible cause of anorexia. Roundworms, which are a type of parasitic organism, can cause anorexia by directly affecting the host's appetite or nutritional intake, as well as indirectly through the host's response to the infection, such as inflammation or immune activation. To further explain, parasites like roundworms can negatively impact their host in several ways. First, they can damage tissues and organs, leading to overall poor health. Second, they can consume the host's nutrients, which can cause malnutrition and exacerbate anorexia. Third, the host's immune system response to the parasites can produce symptoms such as a loss of appetite or feeling unwell, further contributing to anorexia. In contrast, the other options listed- contamination, cigarettes, Leptospirosis, smoking, pesticides, heat or cold, and acetic acid- do not seem directly related to the teacher's clues. While some of these factors might contribute to anorexia in certain situations, they are not supported by the information provided by the teacher. Therefore, based on the context and the teacher's hints, \\"parasites\\" is the most logical answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Deena Marten is a 15-year-old who has become a rebel since dating Garret Lexau, another rebellious teen who was suspended from school for hitting a teacher. Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her newfound harsh attitude upsets her mother, Cynthia, who once enjoyed a close relationship with her daughter. Cynthia is frustrated because the lines of communication have broken down between mother and daughter. Cynthia's relationship with her own mother is not entirely pleasant. Although Cynthia's alcoholic mother advises her daughter to be stricter with Deena, Cynthia does not heed the advice. For example, she tidies Deena's bedroom, a chore which Cynthia has consistently and politely reminded her daughter to do. When Deena discovers what Cynthia has done, she is less than grateful and reacts violently and ends up pushing her mother. Adam, Deena's younger brother notices the impact that Deena's behavior has upon his mother and drinks alcohol in order to forget about the family problems. At one point, Cynthia and Deena's relationship seems to improve, until Cynthia finds out that she has been skipping school. Her confrontation leads to an argument, during which Deena slaps her. Although she admits to Garret that she liked hitting her, Deena later apologizes to her mother, only to ask her to cover for her absence at school. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Deena slapped her mother, Cynthia, because of an argument that arose when Cynthia confronted Deena about her skipping school. This confrontation escalated, leading to the physical altercation where Deena slapped her mother.

Context: Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book. In this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives. THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES This concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go? That’s right, you STOP! Ok, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another. If your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time. This isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often). Question: What school did Dr Nagoski graduate from? Options: - Harvard - Stanford - not enough information - Yale Answer:","completion":"not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is the fawning history of the dynasty known as the House of Barcelona . In presenting the rulers of the county of Barcelona as the descendants of Charlemagne , the monks sought to justify their independent policy with respect to the King of France , their nominal sovereign . The Gesta is the chronological backbone . The first composition was made between 1162 and 1184 and ended with the reign of Raymond Berengar IV ( 1131 -- 62 ) . In the late thirteenth century it was continued through the reign of James I ( 1213 -- 76 ) . An abridged version in the Catalan language was produced sometime between 1268 and 1283 . The final Latin version was edited in 1303 -- 14 and included the reigns of Peter the Great ( 1276 -- 87 ) , Alfonso the Generous ( 1287 -- 91 ) , and James II. Except for the first composition , all surviving versions are later copies , today preserved in the Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó , in the Biblioteca de Catalunya , and in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France . A copy of one of the latter was taken to France by Pierre de Marca and published in 1688 by Étienne Baluze . - The Kingdom of Aragon (, ) was a medieval and early modern kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula, corresponding to the modern-day autonomous community of Aragon, in Spain. It should not be confused with the larger Crown of Aragon, that also included other territories the Principality of Catalonia (which included the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan Counties), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and other possessions that are now part of France, Italy, and Greece that were also under the rule of the King of Aragon, but were administered separately from the Kingdom of Aragon. - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. - The House of Barcelona was a medieval dynasty that ruled the County of Barcelona continuously from 878 and the Crown of Aragon from 1137 (as kings from 1162). From the male part they descend from the Bellonids, the descendants of Wifred the Hairy. They inherited most of the Catalan counties by the thirteenth century and established a territorial Principality of Catalonia, uniting it with the Kingdom of Aragon through marriage and conquering numerous other lands and kingdoms until the death of the last legitimate male of the main branch, Martin the Humanist, in 1410. Cadet branches of the house continued to rule Urgell (since 992) and Gandia. Cadet branches of the dynasty had also ruled Ausona intermittently from 878 until 1111, Provence from 1112 to 1245, and Sicily from 1282 to 1409. By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastámara, descended from the \\"infanta\\" Eleanor of the house of Barcelona. - A dynasty is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a feudal or monarchical system but sometimes also appearing in elective republics. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a \\"house\\"; which may be styled \\"royal\\", \\"princely\\", \\"comital\\", etc., depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians periodize the histories of many sovereign states, such as Ancient Egypt, the Carolingian Empire and Imperial China, using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term \\"dynasty\\" may be used to delimit the era during which the family reigned and to describe events, trends, and artifacts of that period (\\"a Ming-dynasty vase\\"). The word \\"dynasty\\" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references (\\"a Ming vase\\"). - Provence (Provençal: \\"Provença\\" in classical norm or \\"Prouvènço\\" in Mistralian norm) is a geographical region and historical province of southeastern France, which extends from the left bank of the lower Rhône River to the west to the Italian border to the east, and is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. It largely corresponds with the modern administrative \\"région\\" of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and includes the \\"départements\\" of Var, Bouches-du-Rhône, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and parts of Alpes-Maritimes and Vaucluse. The largest city of the region is Marseille. - The Principality of Catalonia, is a historic territory and a medieval and early modern political entity in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula, mostly in Spain, with an adjoining portion in southern France. Between the 13th and the 18th centuries it was bordered by the Kingdom of Aragon to the west, the Kingdom of Valencia to the south, the Kingdom of France and the feudal lordship of Andorra to the north and by the Mediterranean sea to the east. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - The County of Barcelona was originally a frontier region under the rule of the Carolingian dynasty. By the end of the 10th century, the Counts of Barcelona were \\"de facto\\" independent, hereditary rulers in constant warfare with the Islamic caliphate of Córdoba and its successor states. The counts, through marriage alliances and treaties, acquired the other Catalan counties and extended their influence along Occitania. Barcelona formed the nucleus of the emergent Principality of Catalonia. In 1164, the count of Barcelona, Alfons I, inherited the Kingdom of Aragon (as Alfonso II). Thenceforward, the history of the county of Barcelona is subsumed within that of the Crown of Aragon, but the city of Barcelona remained preeminent within it. - An era is a span of time marked by character, events, changes on earth, etc. When used in science, for example geology, an \\"era\\" denotes a clearly defined period of time of arbitrary but well-defined length, such as for example the Mesozoic Era frozen m 252 Ma66 Ma, delimited by a start event and an end event. When used in social history, eras may for example denote a period of some monarch's reign. In colloquial language, eras denote longer spans of time, before and after which the practices or fashions change to a significant degree. When era is extended to a calendar system, it is known as a calendar era. In Sanskrit or Indian culture eras are known as yugas. - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Occitania (, , , , also sometimes lo País d'Òc, \\"the Oc Country\\") is the historical region in southern Europe where Occitan was historically the main language spoken, and where it is sometimes still used, for the most part as a second language. This cultural area roughly encompasses the southern half of France, as well as Monaco and smaller parts of Italy (Occitan Valleys, Guardia Piemontese) and Spain (Aran Valley). Occitania has been recognized as a linguistic and cultural concept since the Middle Ages, but has never been a legal nor a political entity under this name, although the territory was united in Roman times as the \\"Seven Provinces\\" and in the early Middle Ages (\\"Aquitanica\\" or the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse) before the French conquest started in the early 13th century. Currently about 200,000800,000 people out of 16 million living in the area are either native or proficient speakers of Occitan, although the languages more usually spoken in the area are French, Italian, Catalan and Spanish. Since 2006, the Occitan language has been an official language of Catalonia, which includes the Aran Valley where Occitan gained official status in 1990. - A prince is a male ruler, monarch, or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family. \\"Prince\\" is also a hereditary title in the nobility of some European states. The feminine equivalent is a princess. The English word derives, via the French word \\"prince\\", from the Latin noun \\"princeps\\", from \\"primus\\" (first) + \\"capio\\" (to seize), meaning \\"the chief, most distinguished, ruler, prince\\". - The House of Trastámara was a dynasty of kings in Spain , which first governed in Castile beginning in 1369 before expanding its rule into Aragón, Navarre and Naples. They were an illegitimate cadet line of the House of Ivrea. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - The Catalan counties were the administrative divisions of the eastern Carolingian \\"Marca Hispanica\\" and southernmost part of the March of Gothia created after its Frankish conquest. The various counties roughly defined what came to be known as the Principality of Catalonia. - The Bellonids, sometimes called the Bellonid Dynasty, were the counts descendant of the Goth Belló who ruled in Carcassonne, Urgell, Cerdanya, County of Conflent, Barcelona, and numerous other Catalan and Septimanian counties and marches in the 9th and 10th centuries. His most famous grandson was Wilfred the Hairy, who founded the House of Barcelona, rulers of the County of Barcelona from 878, and since 1164 the Crown of Aragon, until the end of the reign of Martin the Humane in 1410. - The Low Countries is a coastal region in western Europe, consisting especially of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the low-lying delta of the Rhine, Meuse, Scheldt, and Ems rivers where much of the land is at or below sea level. This wide area of Western Europe roughly stretches from French Gravelines and Dunkirk at its southwestern point, to the area of Dutch Delfzijl and German Eastern Frisia at its northeastern point, and to Luxembourg and French Thionville in the southeast. - A chronicle (from Greek , from , \\"chronos\\", \\"time\\") is a historical account of facts and events ranged in chronological order, as in a time line. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important. - The Carolingian dynasty (known variously as the Carlovingians, Carolingus, Carolings or Karlings) was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The name \\"Carolingian\\" (Medieval Latin \\"karolingi\\", an altered form of an unattested Old High German word *\\"karling, kerling\\", meaning \\"descendant of Charles\\", cf. MHG \\"kerlinc\\") derives from the Latinised name of Charles Martel: \\"Carolus\\". The dynasty consolidated its power in the mid 8th century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and \\"dux et princeps Francorum\\" hereditary, and becoming the \\"de facto\\" rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the Merovingian throne. In 751 the Merovingian dynasty, which had ruled the Germanic Franks was overthrown with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and a Carolingian Pepin the Short was crowned King of the Franks. The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak in 800 with the crowning of Charlemagne as the first Emperor of Romans in over three centuries. His death in 814 began an extended period of fragmentation of the Carolingian empire and decline that would eventually lead to the evolution of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire. - The Crown of Aragon was a composite monarchy, also nowadays referred to as a confederation of individual polities or kingdoms ruled by one king, with a personal and dynastic union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona. At the height of its power in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon was a thalassocracy (a state with primarily maritime realms) controlling a large portion of present-day eastern Spain, parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean \\"empire\\" which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442) and parts of Greece (until 1388). The component realms of the Crown were not united politically except at the level of the king, who ruled over each autonomous polity according to its own laws, raising funds under each tax structure, dealing separately with each \\"Corts\\" or \\"Cortes\\". Put in contemporary terms, it has sometimes been considered that the different lands of the Crown of Aragon (mainly the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Valencia) functioned more as a confederation than as a single kingdom. In this sense, the larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot).

Information: - The Cladocera are an order of small crustaceans commonly called water fleas. Around 620 species have been recognised so far, with many more undescribed. They are ubiquitous in inland aquatic habitats, but rare in the oceans. Most are long, with a down-turned head with a single median compound eye, and a carapace covering the apparently unsegmented thorax and abdomen. Most species show cyclical parthenogenesis, where asexual reproduction is occasionally supplemented by sexual reproduction, which produces resting eggs that allow the species to survive harsh conditions and disperse to distant habitats. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - A carapace is a dorsal (upper) section of the exoskeleton or shell in a number of animal groups, including arthropods, such as crustaceans and arachnids, as well as vertebrates, such as turtles and tortoises. In turtles and tortoises, the underside is called the plastron. - Parthenogenesis (from the Greek parthenos, \\"virgin\\", + genesis, \\"creation\\") is a natural form of asexual reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization. In animals, parthenogenesis means development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell. In plants parthenogenesis is a component process of apomixis. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Daphniidae is a family of water fleas in the sub-order Anomopoda. - The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; \\"\\") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area). - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - The thorax or chest (from the Greek \\"thorax\\" \\"breastplate, cuirass, corslet\\" via ) is a part of the anatomy of humans and various other animals located between the neck and the abdomen. The thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain. - Moinidae is a crustacean family within the order Cladocera . Species within this family are widely occurring including the continents of North America and Africa . In newer classifications it is sometimes included in the family Daphniidae . Moina is one of two genera in the family . - Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction by which offspring arise from a single organism, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it does not involve the fusion of gametes, and almost never changes the number of chromosomes. Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for single-celled organisms such as the Archaea and bacteria. Many plants and fungi reproduce asexually as well. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - Afri (singular \\"Afer\\") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). Latin-speakers at first used \\"afer\\" as an adjective, meaning \\"of Africa\\". As a substantive, it denoted a native of \\"Africa\\", i. e., an African.

I have to assume QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill if he does a film that is as true to the comics and books as My Name is Modesty, with another tough female lead, anyone not familiar with the character will see this as a let-down.

The tug of wills between Modesty and Miklos is very true to the source material and is tense, suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who doesn't have to have gore and explosions. Alexandra did a great job in playing how O'Donnell's character would have taken control of the situation. I find this particularly ahead of the curve following the sorely needed reboots of Batman and James Bond.

Pick your answer from: (a). no (b). yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. They both inquire if it's normal to have purple veins under the tongue. I will provide a detailed and long answer to the question. The presence of purple veins under the tongue can be considered normal in many cases. The veins under the tongue may appear to be larger and more noticeable for multiple reasons, such as the translucent nature of the thin oral mucosa and the close proximity of the veins to the surface. Additionally, the veins may appear more purple or blueish due to the optical properties of human tissue and how it interacts with different wavelengths of light. Various factors can contribute to the prominence and appearance of the veins under your tongue. Some of these factors include: 1. Genetics: The size and color of the veins can be inherited from your parents. If your family members have more noticeable veins, you may also have them. 2. Age: As you age, your skin becomes thinner, making your veins more visible. 3. Blood flow: Increased blood flow to the area can cause veins to appear more prominent. This can happen during exercise, exposure to warm temperatures, or when you are feeling emotional or stressed. 4. Health conditions: Certain health conditions, such as varicose veins or venous insufficiency, can cause veins to appear more noticeable and darker in color. However, these conditions usually affect veins in the legs and aren't typically observed in the mouth. 5. Inflammation or Infection: In some cases, the presence of a localized infection or inflammation in the mouth can cause the veins to appear more prominent. If you experience pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling in conjunction with the purple veins, it is important to consult a healthcare professional. It's important to note that everyone's oral anatomy is unique, and purple veins under the tongue may be a normal part of your individual anatomy. However, if you notice any sudden or concerning changes in the appearance of the veins under your tongue, or experience additional symptoms like pain, swelling, or difficulty swallowing, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any potential medical issues. That being said, in general, the presence of purple veins under the tongue can be considered a normal variation in human anatomy (answer b)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of the French from Egypt (1799), the capture of Java from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of Penang Island (1786), Singapore (1819) and Malacca (1824), and the defeat of Burma (1826).From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitt's India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired. The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline. The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India. India became the empire's most valuable possession, \\"the Jewel in the Crown\\", and was the...

To say that a hypothesis is entailed by a premise, we must be able to come to a certain conclusion based solely on the information provided in the premise. In the given premise, \\"noble warrior,\\" it only gives us two pieces of information: that the individual in question is a warrior and that this person is noble. The term 'noble' typically refers to someone of noble birth or someone who is honorable and has high moral qualities. It does not necessarily mean physical strength. While it's common to associate warriors with strength, it is not an inherent aspect. A warrior could be skilled and effective due to their strategy, speed, agility, intelligence or experience rather than their raw physical strength. Some warriors could be more known for their cunning, their leadership, their technical skills, or their courage rather than their strength per see. Therefore, being a warrior does not inherently mean you are strong. Hence, the hypothesis \\"He was a strong warrior\\" cannot be confirmed or denied based on the given premise. We can't determine or assume the warrior's physical strength from the statement 'noble warrior'. The two terms—'noble' and 'strong'—are not universally or inherently synonymous. Strength and nobility are different attributes that do not coincide necessarily. So, to conclude, based on the premise 'Noble Warrior,' the hypothesis 'He was a strong warrior' is not necessarily entailed.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Choose a trusted person to talk to who will not gossip about conversation within your circle of friends. Be as objective as possible when explaining the circumstances and ask for an unbiased opinion. Talking over your problem with family, a friend, a therapist, or a clergy member may help you come to a good decision as to how best to handle the situation. If it gets back to your friend that you have been talking about them behind their back (even if it was not a negative conversation), then you may not be in the driver's seat about ending it any more. You and your friend have already had a fight bad enough for you to consider whether or not the friendship can survive. Don't complicate things by talking about it with someone you both know; talk to someone outside your shared circle. Ask a friend, family member, or even the friend you fought with (if you are speaking to each other) about how you contributed to the fight. Maybe they can help you see something in your personality that is contributing to the problem in your friendship. Be sure to think about the feedback the person gives you and why they might be giving you this feedback. If you think your fight was more about your own problems than your friend, talk to your friend about it. You could say, “I think part of the reason why our fight was so bad was because I have been dealing with a lot of stress lately. I took it out on you, and I am sorry,” or “I’ve ditched friends in the past after getting into fights with them, and I think it’s a pattern with me.” If your conversations reveal patterns in your behavior that are troubling you, then you may wish to seek professional help. For example, your friends and family tell you that you have a volatile temper, then you may want to seek help. Consider talking to a counselor about your concerns. Keep in mind that good communication skills are essential to healthy relationships. Work on building your communication skills and body language to express yourself more effectively to friends, family, and coworkers. If you and your friend are on speaking terms, you could decide to talk about the fight and figure out what went wrong and attempt to compromise with them. Make sure you do this when you are calm and able to keep your emotions in check. It may be good to wait a few days for to get over the raw emotions. Find a time and place to talk privately. You could say, “I think we need to talk about what happened. Would you be able to meet me this afternoon?” Don’t go into your conversation with an agenda. Keep an open mind about what your friend has to say and listen to their perspective. Remember, you don’t want to continue your fight, you want to figure out if this friendship is worth saving. If your friend gets argumentative, you could say, “I don’t want to argue, I just want to figure out what’s going on with us. If we can’t do that without anger, then maybe we should take a break.” You could decide to follow up later with another conversation, or make the decision to keep your distance from the person. Compromising can be a win-win situation for you and your friend. To find middle ground for a compromise, try asking questions like, \\"Is this something where I have to have the final say and be right?\\" \\"What is it that I am right about?\\" \\"Is this something that is of value to the other person?\\" \\"Is it okay that they have their own opinions on a particular matter?\\" \\"Is my conflict with this person or issue more important than my friendship?\\" \\"Is it worth spending so much time and energy arguing, or would our time be better spent in a more positive interaction?\\" You and your friend could discuss what each of you see as problems in your relationship, and figure out how each of you can help solve the problem. Make sure both of you keep an open mind and listen to what the other person has to say. Name the problem and suggest a fix. For example, maybe your friend is not good at returning your texts and calls. You could say, “You don’t have to respond to every single text, but it really hurts my feelings when you don’t communicate with me, especially when I need to talk to someone. Do you think you could do a better job of responding to me?” Listen to your friend’s concerns. Acknowledge their point of view. For example, you could say, “I can see how you would think I was ignoring you when I was talking to Juan. I’m sorry that I hurt you. What I was really doing was….” Summary:","completion":"To handle a situation where you're considering ending a friendship after a fight, follow these steps: 1. Choose a trusted, unbiased person outside your circle of friends to talk to about the situation. 2. Be open and objective about the circumstances and ask for their opinion. 3. Reflect on your own contribution to the fight and any patterns in your behavior. 4. If needed, seek professional help to address any personal issues that may be affecting your friendships. 5. Work on improving your communication skills to express yourself better. 6. If you and your friend are on speaking terms, initiate a calm and private conversation to discuss the fight and each other's perspectives. 7. Be open-minded and listen to your friend's opinions without arguing or continuing the fight. 8. Find a middle ground for compromise by asking questions and valuing each other's opinions. 9. Work together to identify problems in your relationship and suggest ways to fix them, while being empathetic and understanding. 10. Reach a decision regarding the continuity of your friendship based on your conversations and the willingness of both parties to make amends and find compromise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Produced by Roger Pusey, and assisted by Ted De Bono, this version of the song was first included on the 1984 compilation Hatful of Hollow. On 28 October 1983, the \\"Manchester\\" version was released in the UK in 7\\" and 12\\" formats, reaching number 25 in the UK charts. The record sleeve uses a still frame from Jean Cocteau's 1949 film Orphée, featuring French actor Jean Marais. The song was later included as a bonus track on the cassette version of the band's debut album The Smiths in the UK, and subsequently on all American versions. Following the 1989 bankruptcy of Rough Trade, WEA Records purchased the Smiths' back catalogue.

My friend and I went here for lunch the other day and it was a very interesting experience. She was on her lunch break from work so she was in her uniform, a pretty obvious indication that we're going to be in a hurry. We sit at the bar since it's pretty slow and that way would be able to order right away with the bartender. She came over and took our drink orders then wandered off to go get them. While she was doing that a group of about four guys came in and sat a few seats down from us. They must have been very interested because they caused the bartender to completely forget about us. She dropped off our drinks and rushed over to take their order. A few minutes later she must have gotten the crazy idea that maybe we wanted something to eat as well so she asked if we wanted some menus. Um, yeah...thanks for noticing! She quickly took our order, taking time out in between to find out if the group of guys needed another round. I'm sorry that it took us all of two minutes to tell you what we wanted to eat, next time we'll try to speed that up for you. Once we finished my friend asked to have her food boxed up to take home.

Zack learned about Earth's atmosphere, while Ken learned about the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus. Which student learned more about corrosive sulfuric acid? Answer:","completion":"Ken, the student who studied the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus, learned more about corrosive sulfuric acid. This is due to the fact that Venus' atmosphere is known to have a significantly higher concentration of sulfuric acid compared to Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere of Venus consists of an incredibly dense and toxic layer composed of roughly 96.5% carbon dioxide (CO2) and 3.5% nitrogen (N2), with trace amounts of other gases. Among these trace gases, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) plays a particularly important role in shaping the planet's corrosive and toxic atmospheric conditions. Sulfuric acid is a strong, caustic chemical compound that forms when sulfur dioxide (SO2) reacts with water (H2O) in the atmosphere. Venus has an abundance of volcanic activity, which releases significant amounts of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. Once emitted, sulfur dioxide reacts with water vapor present in the Venusian atmosphere to form sulfuric acid aerosols and clouds. Venus' thick cloud layer, which extends from about 47 km to 70 km above the planet's surface, consists primarily of sulfuric acid droplets. These sulfuric acid clouds contribute to the extreme greenhouse effect that makes Venus the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures averaging around 450°C (842°F). In contrast, Earth's atmosphere is composed of roughly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gases, including very low concentrations of sulfuric acid. On Earth, sulfuric acid is occasionally produced as a result of volcanic activity or industrial processes but is present in extremely low concentrations compared to those found on Venus. In addition, Earth's natural atmospheric and chemical processes work to mitigate and neutralize the effects of sulfuric acid, preventing it from accumulating to harmful levels. Therefore, Ken, who studied the atmosphere of Venus, undoubtedly learned more about corrosive sulfuric acid and its role in shaping the hostile environment found on Earth's \\"sister planet.\\" Although sulfuric acid is present in Earth's atmosphere, its significantly lower concentration and less crucial role in shaping our planet's climate make it a less prominent topic of study for Zack, who focused on Earth's atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand.

Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin.

Question: \\"Who did the Crusaders come before?\\" Context: \\"The crusades were intended to seize Jerusalem from Muslim control. The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II (pope 1088–99) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) for aid against further Muslim advances. Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction. Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service.\\" Answer:","completion":"The Crusaders primarily came before the Muslim forces that controlled Jerusalem and the surrounding Holy Land during the time of the Crusades. The objective of the Crusades was to reclaim Jerusalem and other significant Christian sites in the region from Muslim rule. Before the Crusaders arrived, these territories were under the control of various Muslim dynasties, including the Fatimid Caliphate and the Seljuk Turks. The First Crusade (1096-1099) was launched after Pope Urban II received a call for assistance from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, who was seeking help against the advancing Muslim armies. The Crusaders, consisting of people from various social levels across Europe, assembled and eventually captured Jerusalem in 1099. Throughout the Crusades, Crusaders encountered and fought not only Muslim forces but also other groups such as Jews and even fellow Christians, depending on the specific context of each Crusade. One example of this is the frequent pogroms against Jewish communities that took place as the Crusaders made their way eastward, such as those during the First Crusade that devastated Jewish settlements in cities like Cologne, Mainz, and Worms. Another aspect of the Crusades was the development of new monastic orders, like the Knights Templar and the Hospitallers, which combined monastic life and military service. These orders played a crucial role in maintaining the Crusader presence in the Holy Land, as well as waging battles against Muslim forces throughout the period of the Crusades from the late 11th to the early 13th centuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the persont that painted Charles IV of Spain and His Family?, using the article: In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by Las Meninas. Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\". Goya's royal family is presented on a \\"stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person who painted \\"Charles IV of Spain and His Family\\" is Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes, more commonly known as Francisco Goya.

Let's explore their significance in greater detail: 1. People: This word indicates that the focus of the sentence is on the individuals or a group of individuals present in the scene. It conveys the subject, or main actors, of the scene described. 2. Fishing: This word represents the primary activity being performed by the people mentioned. It serves to establish what these individuals are doing and sets up the image in the reader's mind of people engaged in a recreational or occupational pursuit. 3.

The glaring issues within the script, direction, and editing make it difficult for viewers to invest themselves in the story and empathize with the characters, resulting in a vastly negative experience for moviegoers. The film follows two estranged siblings, Sarah and Nick, who are forced to come together after the sudden death of their mother. Their quest to unravel the secrets of their mother's past is met with numerous challenges and unexpected revelations, which could have made for an intriguing narrative, if not for the various flaws that overshadow the story. The script for \\"Rising Sunsets\\" feels clunky and disjointed, with stilted dialogue that fails to capture any semblance of authenticity. Each line of conversation feels forced and unnatural, culminating in an awkward exchange of words amongst the characters, rather than genuine conversation. The lack of subtlety and nuance in the writing results in an over-explanation of every plot detail, leaving viewers feeling unengaged and uninterested in the story unfolding before them. Unfortunately, the visual aspects of the film follow the same pattern. Scenes appear incomplete and haphazardly stitched together, constantly jarring the audience out of their immersion in the movie. The pacing, too, is wildly inconsistent, and it often feels as though the director was unsure of how to maintain the audience's attention. This results in scenes that drag on for far too long or are quickly dismissed, depriving the viewers of the chance to build a connection to the events taking place on screen. Lastly, the editing choices in \\"Rising Sunsets\\" often appear careless and haphazard. Moments of tension and emotion are undercut by jarring cuts that rip viewers from their investment in the characters' emotional journeys. Additionally, the film's score oscillates between intrusive and melodramatic, further detracting from the emotional impact of crucial scenes.

Answer:","completion":"To answer the question \\"when does water expand?\\" and considering the given statement that water expands when it's cold, I will go through the following steps: Step 1: Understand the concepts of water expansion and temperature effect Water expands and contracts due to changes in temperature. Normally, substances expand when heated and contract when cooled, and water typically follows this behavior except in a specific temperature range. Step 2: Recognize the exception with water Water has a unique property where it expands when cooled, specifically between temperatures of 4°C and 0°C (39.2°F and 32°F). This is because of the formation of a crystal lattice structure in ice, which takes up more space than liquid water at higher temperatures. However, outside of this temperature range, water follows the typical expansion rule and expands when it's hot. Step 3: Address the question Given this information, the right answer to the question is not just \\"when it's hot.\\" A more accurate answer would be \\"water expands both when it's hot and when it's cold between temperatures of 4°C and 0°C.\\" This answer takes into account both the typical expansion behavior at higher temperatures and the unique expansion behavior of water at lower temperatures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 began recording their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\". Released in November 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can't Leave Behind, setting a personal best for the band. Overall, it sold 9 million copies globally. For the album's release, U2 partnered with Apple for several cross-promotions: the first single, \\"Vertigo\\", was featured in a television advertisement for the company's iPod music player, while a U2-branded iPod and digital box set exclusive to the iTunes Store were released. \\"Vertigo\\" was an international hit, topping the charts in Ireland and the UK, while reaching number two in Canada, number five in Australia, and number 31 in the US. The song won three Grammy Awards, including one for Best Rock Song. Other singles from the album were also hits; \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\", written as a tribute to Bono's late father, went to number one in the UK and Canada, while \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" reached number two in both regions. In March 2005, U2 were... A:","completion":"The name of the song that won three Grammy awards by the band that had an album reach number one in 30 countries is \\"Vertigo\\" by U2.

What is the most logical next event? We see people surfing in the ocean two men are taking images. We see a title screen then two men stand on the beach with a camera. we","completion":"Based on the given scenario, the most logical next event would involve the two men with the camera starting to document or record their surroundings, capturing various aspects of the beach and the people surfing in the ocean. They might begin by framing the breathtaking views of the ocean, capturing waves crashing against the shore, and taking wide-angle shots to showcase the expansiveness of the beach. The two men could take close-ups of surfers as they ride the waves, showcasing their skills and stunts in the water. They might also capture the surfboards, highlighting the colorful designs and different shapes and sizes. In addition to the surfers, the two men might also want to capture other beachgoers, such as families playing in the sand, children building sandcastles, and couples walking hand-in-hand along the shore. They might also include shots of other activities happening at the beach, such as people playing beach volleyball, sunbathers relaxing under the sun, and local vendors selling food and drinks. The cameramen could also focus on the natural beauty of the ocean and its surroundings, capturing the wildlife that inhabits the area, such as seagulls, crabs, or even dolphins and seals if they happen to be nearby. They might zoom in on the serene view of the sun setting in the distance, casting a warm golden light on the waves and wet sand, or they might capture the gentle sway of nearby palm trees as they bend under the coastal breeze. As the scene progresses, the two men could interact with some of the other people at the beach. They might approach surfers to ask about their experiences, the types of surfboards they are using, or any tips they have for beginners. They could also engage with beach visitors and locals alike, discussing favorite beach activities, local attractions, and the overall ambiance of the beach environment. Throughout their time at the beach, the two men might also reflect on their own experiences, sharing their thoughts on the incredible surf conditions, the friendliness of the people they encounter, and the peaceful yet exhilarating atmosphere the beach has to offer. By capturing these various elements, the two men are creating a detailed, immersive, and engaging visual narrative that showcases the beauty of the beach, the thrill of the ocean waves, and the unique experiences and stories of the people who come to enjoy them. This footage could later be edited into a documentary, promotional video, or even a social media post, allowing viewers to be transported to the shore and feel the sand between their toes without ever leaving their homes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital. - Oncidium, abbreviated as Onc. in the horticultural trade, is a genus that contains about 330 species of orchids from the subtribe Oncidiinae of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). As presently conceived (May 2014), it is distributed across much of South America, Central America, Mexico and the West Indies, with one species \\"(O. ensatum)\\" extending into Florida. Common names for plants in this genus include dancing-lady orchid and golden shower orchid. In 2008, Oxfords Annals of Botany labeled the \\"Oncidium\\" alliance \\"grossly polyphyletic.\\" The American Orchid Society labeled this genus a \\"dumping ground.\\" After DNA testing and much debate, a consensus was announced (April 2013) resulting in major taxonomic changes to \\"Oncidium, Gomesa, Odontoglossum, Miltonia,\\" and others. Much of this debate and subsequent housekeeping was initiated by significant research for the scientific publication Genera Orchidacearum Volume 5. As a result, much of the information in this article is now deprecated, but still of great value. One significant change is the move of most Brazilian \\"Oncidium\\" with a fused lateral sepal to the genus \\"Gomesa\\". The Royal Horticultural Society system, the World Checklist of Monocots database at http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/home.do and the American Orchid Society have already updated their databases to reflect most of these changes. Description. This genus was first described by Olof Swartz in 1800 with the orchid \\"Oncidium altissimum\\", which has become the type species. Its name is derived from the Greek word , \\"onkos\\", meaning \\"swelling\\". This refers to the callus at the lower lip. - The Oncidiinae is a subtribe within the Orchidaceae that consists of a number of genera that are closely related. - Odontoglossum, first named in 1816 by Karl Sigismund Kunth, is a genus of about 100 orchids. The scientific name is derived from the Greek words \\"odon\\" (tooth) and \\"glossa\\" (tongue), referring to the two tooth-like calluses on the base of the lip. This genus of cool to cold growing orchids is to be found on open spots in the humid cloud forest at higher elevations from Central- and West South America to Guyana, with most species around the northern Andes. The abbreviation for this genus is Odm. in the horticultural trade. - Olof Peter Swartz (September 21, 1760 September 19, 1818) was a Swedish botanist and taxonomist. He is best known for his taxonomic work and studies into pteridophytes. He attended the University of Uppsala where he studied under Carolus Linnaeus the Younger and received his doctorate in 1781. He first traveled in 1780, to Lapland in the company of several other botanists. In 1783 he sailed for North America and the West Indies, primarily in the area of Jamaica and Hispaniola, to collect botanical specimens. His botanical collection, of an impressive 6000 specimens, is now held by the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as part of the Regnellian herbarium. By 1786 he left for London to prepare his collection. There he met Joseph Banks, who was impressed with his knowledge of Botany. He was offered a position with the British East India Company as a travelling physician, but turned it down, and returned to Sweden in 1787. Ten years later he proposed to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he became a member in 1789) the idea of a permanent travel grant, based on the methods he had seen employed by Banks within the British Empire. In 1791 he became Professor Bergianus at the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805. - The American Orchid Society is a horticultural society devoted to education, conservation, and research of orchids (plant family Orchidaceae). The organization was founded in 1921, and now has a worldwide membership. The organization publishes a monthly magazine, \\"Orchids, The Bulletin of the American Orchid Society.\\" The society's website American Orchid Society website has the answer to all questions orchid, including helpful, reliable information on how to grow your orchids. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent. - The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and often fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family. - Colmanara, abbreviated Colm. in the horticultural trade, is the nothogenus comprising intergeneric hybrids between the orchid genera \\"Miltonia\\", \\"Odontoglossum\\" and \\"Oncidium\\" (Milt. x Odm. x Onc.). - Annals of Botany is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal, founded in 1887, that publishes research articles, brief communications, and reviews in all areas of botany. The journal is supported and managed by Annals of Botany Company, a non-profit educational charity, and published through Oxford University Press. According to the 2011 \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" it has an impact factor of 4.030, in 2009 ranking 18th out of 172 in the category Plant Sciences. - Miltonia, abbreviated Milt. in the horticultural trade, is an orchid genus formed by nine epiphyte species and eight natural hybrids inhabitants of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one species reaching the northeast of Argentina and east of Paraguay. This genus was established by John Lindley in 1837, when he described its type species, \\"Miltonia spectabilis\\". Many species were attributed to \\"Miltonia\\" in the past, however, today, the species from Central America and from cooler areas on northwest of South America have been moved to other genera. \\"Miltonia\\" species have large and long lasting flowers, often in multifloral inflorescences. This fact, allied to being species that are easy to grow and to identify, make them a favorite of orchid collectors all over the world. Species of this genus are extensively used to produce artificial hybrids. - Odontocidium , abbreviated as Odcdm . in the horticultural trade , is the nothogenus comprising intergeneric hybrids of the two orchid genera Odontoglossum and Oncidium ( Odm . x Onc . ) . Many orchids formerly classified as Colmanara have been reclassified as Odontocidium by the American Orchid Society . - Oncidium altissimum, Wydler's dancing-lady orchid, is a species of orchid native to the West Indies (Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles), with an 18th-Century citation from Jamaica. - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. What is the relationship between 'odontocidium' and 'orchidaceae'? A:","completion":"The relationship between 'Odontocidium' and 'Orchidaceae' is that Odontocidium is a nothogenus of orchids created by intergeneric hybridization between the two orchid genera, Odontoglossum and Oncidium (Odm. x Onc.). Orchidaceae, on the other hand, is the wider botanical family that encompasses all orchids, including Odontocidium.

Given those answer options, answer the question: So a couple of weeks ago I was lucky enough to be invited to The Body Shop® blogger event at my local store in Coppergate, York. It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are. I also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop® are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just £45. The larger calendars included some full size products too which I thought was great. There’s also going to be a Countdown to New Year calendar priced at just £50 which I thought was a great fun idea.

The Blogger Event organized by Indigo Rosee in collaboration with The Body Shop® store in Coppergate, York was evidently a massive success. This was due to a combination of factors including the well-planned setup, product demonstrations, appealing offers, attentive staff, and an enjoyable atmosphere. Firstly, showcasing the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection through hands-on demonstrations grabbed the attention of all attendees, allowing them to experience the products first-hand. This is an effective way to connect the brand with potential customers and generate interest in the products. Secondly, promoting the huge sale with amazing deals on shower gels, body butters, and gift sets presented an added incentive for attendees to purchase these products. Additionally, offering three types of 2017 beauty advent calendars and a Countdown to New Year calendar not only demonstrated product variety but also suggested that The Body Shop® has something for everyone. Thirdly, the interactive hand spa and massage featuring the luxurious Spa Of The World products was a great way to allow attendees to indulge in an unforgettable experience. This, in turn, left a lasting impression on the attendees about the brand's quality and luxuriousness. Furthermore, the warm and welcoming atmosphere – with prosecco and nibbles for all – helped to create a positive experience. The friendly chats between staff and attendees offered an opportunity for them to ask questions about new products, find out about staff favorites, and learn more about The Body Shop® brand. Considering these factors, it is highly likely that the Blogger Event was so successful that it significantly increased The Body Shop®'s brand awareness and customer base. By attracting both beauty enthusiasts and bloggers, the event contributed to word-of-mouth marketing, with attendees likely sharing their experience and discussing the products with friends, family, and followers on social media. This ripple effect has the potential to introduce The Body Shop® to a wider audience, boost sales, and ultimately establish stronger connections with customers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. - Colombia (or ), officially the Republic of Colombia, is a transcontinental country largely situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America. Colombia shares a border to the northwest with Panama, to the east with Venezuela and Brazil and to the south with Ecuador and Peru. It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments. The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples including the Muisca, the Quimbaya and the Tairona. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A gill is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment. - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\". - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. - The winghead shark (\\"Eusphyra blochii\\") is a species of hammerhead shark, and part of the family Sphyrnidae. Reaching a length of , this small brown to gray shark has a slender body with a tall, sickle-shaped first dorsal fin. Its name comes from its exceptionally large \\"hammer\\", or cephalofoil, which can be as wide as half of the shark's total length. The function of this structure is unclear but may relate to the shark's senses. The wide spacing of its eyes grants superb binocular vision, while the extremely long nostrils on the leading margin of the cephalofoil may allow for better detection and tracking of odor trails in the water. The cephalofoil also provides a large surface area for its ampullae of Lorenzini and lateral line, with potential benefits for electroreception and mechanoreception respectively. - Costa Rica (literally meaning \\"Rich Coast\\"), officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island. It has a population of around 4.5 million, of whom nearly a quarter live in the metropolitan area of the capital and largest city, San José. - Lampreys (sometimes also called, inaccurately, lamprey eels) are any jawless fish of the order Petromyzontiformes, placed in the superclass Cyclostomata. The adult lamprey may be characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. The common name \\"lamprey\\" is probably derived from Latin \\"lampetra\\", which may mean \\"stone licker\\" (\\"lambere\\" \\"to lick\\" + \\"petra\\" \\"stone\\"), though the etymology is uncertain. - Malpelo is a small island in the East Pacific Ocean, located about west of the Colombian mainland. Except for a small military post that is manned by the Colombian Armed Forces, it is uninhabited. It consists of a sheer and barren rock with three high peaks, the highest being \\"Cerro de la Mona\\" with a height of . The island is about one mile in length from northeast to southwest, and 700 yards in width. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A fin is a thin component or appendage attached to a larger body or structure.

The subphylum was at one time called Urochordata, and the term urochordates is still sometimes used for these animals. Some tunicates live as solitary individuals, but others replicate by budding and become colonies, each unit being known as a zooid. They are marine filter feeders with a water-filled, sac-like body structure and two tubular openings, known as siphons, through which they draw in and expel water. During their respiration and feeding, they take in water through the incurrent (or inhalant) siphon and expel the filtered water through the excurrent (or exhalant) siphon. Most adult tunicates are sessile, and are permanently attached to rocks or other hard surfaces on the ocean floor; others, such as salps, doliolids and pyrosomes, swim in the pelagic zone of the sea as adults. Various species are commonly known as sea squirts, sea pork, sea livers, or sea tulips. - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - USS Hammerhead ( SSN - 663 ) , a Sturgeon - class submarine , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the hammerhead shark , a voracious fish found in warm seas , with a curious hammerlike head . - In cryptography, SHARK is a block cipher identified as one of the predecessors of Rijndael (the Advanced Encryption Standard). - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks in the family Sphyrnidae, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a \\"hammer\\" shape called a cephalofoil. Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus Sphyrna while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, Eusphyra. Many not necessarily mutually exclusive functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night. Some of these schools can be found near Malpelo Island in Colombia, Cocos Island off Costa Rica, and near Molokai in Hawaii. Large schools are also seen in the waters off southern and eastern Africa.

Introduction The excitement of sports is often captured in those memorable moments when a team gets the upper hand by initiating a lead or making a game changing play. One such instance occurred in a thrilling match-up, where fans were left on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating which team would take control of the game during the 2nd quarter. This article will provide an in-depth analysis of the circumstances leading up to the crucial first score in the 2nd quarter, the players involved, and the impact that it had on the game's outcome. The Pressure Builds: A First Quarter Summary Following a closely contested first quarter, both teams were neck and neck with neither team willing to concede any points on the scoreboard. Strong defensive tactics came into play as both teams made strategic attempts to deter their opponents from inching any closer to victory. From intense man-to-man battles to shifting towards zone defenses, the first quarter was rife with heated exchanges and heart-stopping moments. The Teams: A Quick Overview Before delving further into the electrifying second quarter, it is essential to develop an understanding of the teams involved in this nail-biting match. On one side stood Team A - a squad known for its devastating offensive prowess and an uncanny ability to dominate the court. Their players' athleticism only matched their precise shooting skills, leaving opponents often overwhelmed and battered. Facing them was Team B - a master of defensive strategies, armed with players who pride themselves on being unyielding under relentless pressure. Famed for their ability to suffocate adversaries with their disciplined approach to the game, Team B was a force to be reckoned with. The Fateful Moment: The 2nd Quarter Begins As the second quarter began, both the teams were well aware that a single score could be the catalyst to propel either team to an assertive lead. The energy on the court was palpable, each player itching to take possession of the ball and make the opening play for their team. The moment of truth arrived when Team B managed to intercept a pass made by Team A's point guard. Transforming defense into offense at the speed of light, Team B's small forward quickly took off down the court and headed straight towards the basket, letting out a powerful roar as they did so. The crowd grew louder in anticipation, ebbing closer to a collective explosion of jubilant cheers. On the opposite end, Team A's defense scrambled to get back into position, attempting to shut down the imminent attack. In a desperate bid to secure any chance of maintaining a clean slate, Team A's power forward lunged towards Team B's oncoming player – the move matched with lightning reflexes and expert timing. The Decisive Score: Shifting the Game's Momentum In the face of mounting pressure and facing a rapidly encroaching defense, Team B's small forward persevered. With the ball securely in hand, they leapt towards the rim, easily evading the sliding defense, and executed a flawless lay-up. The basketball slid silently through the net, and as it did, the arena erupted with ecstatic cheers. Team B had successfully scored the first points of the 2nd quarter. The Aftermath: The Impact on the Rest of the Game With Team B gaining the upper hand, the game's momentum began to swing in their favor. The first score in the 2nd quarter instilled a newfound confidence in the players and further galvanized their defensive prowess. Despite Team A's persistent effort to regain control of the game, Team B's unwavering defense proved to be an insurmountable obstacle. Although the game remained competitive, Team B maintained their lead throughout the game and ultimately walked away victorious. Conclusion The importance of the 2nd quarter's first score cannot be understated - it was a turning point that truly altered the trajectory of the game.

This film ensued under the creative guidance of its writers and directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg are renowned for their other comedic works but notably, they took on the mantle for this franchise's installment and carried forward the legacy of the series that had carved out a segment for itself in the sex-comedy genre. Late '90s and early '00s brought forth the raw, unfiltered, and direct humor of high school and college dramas with storylines that often navigated through delicate conversations related to sex, and stumbled upon funny, awkward, and sometimes insightful scenarios. The series started with American Pie in 1999, followed by the sequel American Pie 2 in 2001, and American Wedding in 2003. Each feature offered entertaining experiences and captured the crowd's interest, which evidently paved the way for the fourth installment, American Reunion, in 2012. American Reunion invited original cast members to reprise their roles, offering audiences a nostalgic trip down memory lane and bringing back the characters loved by many. It portrayed the main characters returning to their hometown for their high school reunion and wove in interesting, novel, and amusing predicaments around it.

Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

In Cuchillo, New Mexico, 1887, a group of five Outlaws, led by Henry, are robbing the town bank, which culminates in a shoot-out with the residents of the town. A posse of bounty hunters, led by Josiah, is formed and are in hot pursuit, \\"only being a half-day behind them\\". The outlaws are now down to four after one of the men was shot dead after the robbery. They are met on the path by a couple, who are the aunt and uncle of Charlie, and brought them supplies. They find out that there is a bounty of 8000 dollars on their heads. They shoot the couple so they cannot turn them in for the reward money. The posse comes upon the scene of the dead couple, and Josiah talks to the couples' granddaughter Lulu, who hid in the bushes when her grandparents were shot. She tells them that they are headed East through White Sands, to make them more difficult to track. The outlaws are down to three, when one passes out and they shoot him to put him out of his misery. They spot the Tildon farm, where Preacher George and Ada live with their teenage daughters, Charlotte and Florence, and make plan to descend on them at dark. They burst in to the house, and start eating and drinking whiskey and intend to have relations with the women. Florence catches Henry's eye and he calls her to sit on his lap.

Here is a question about this article: The distinctive characteristic of Gothic cathedrals of the Iberian Peninsula is their spatial complexity, with many areas of different shapes leading from each other. They are comparatively wide, and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories, giving a similar spacious appearance to the 'Hallenkirche of Germany, as at the Church of the Batalha Monastery in Portugal. Many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels. Like English cathedrals, each is often stylistically diverse. This expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources. Among the influences on both decoration and form are Islamic architecture and, towards the end of the period, Renaissance details combined with the Gothic in a distinctive manner. The West front, as at Leon Cathedral, typically resembles a French west front, but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces. At Burgos Cathedral there are spires of German style. The roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles.

But the tiny beetle smaller than a penny quickly proved to be invasive here, where ash trees have not evolved to protect themselves from its ravenous appetite—it's claimed 30 million trees across 26 states and counting, reports AFP. The situation is so dire it's \\"bordering on catastrophic,\\" one Michigan scientist tells NPR, which profiles the bug's impact on the Rawlings plant in New York state, where iconic Rawlings baseball bats have been made for more than a century. Most of those are made of ash, which sluggers like because they don't shatter as easily as bats of other wood. \\"If the ash borer is not controlled, it'll wipe out the entire species of white ash,\\" plant manager Vander Groef says. The problem is that figuring out remedies is still in the early stages, and he predicts the plant's ash supply will be gone or unaffordable in three years. The US Forest Service has equally grim news, saying few if any ash trees will survive in infested areas and labeling the beetle \\"the most devastating forest insect to reach North America in modern times.\\" A new pesticide may help attack the beetle's larvae, but it's expensive and likely not fast enough. St. Louis, for example, is preparing to cut down almost all of the city's 14,000 ash trees, or 17% of the city's tree population. \\"We really have no other choice,\\" says a forestry official. (These wasps might help.) Expand this summary.","completion":"The Emerald Ash Borer, a small beetle native to Asia, made its way to the United States in the 1990s and has since wreaked havoc on ash trees, causing devastation to forests as well as trouble for industries relying on the wood. In Asia, the beetle only feeds on weak and dying ash trees, but in the US, where ash trees have not evolved to protect themselves from the beetle, the insect has quickly turned into an invasive species. It has been reported that the Emerald Ash Borer has claimed 30 million trees across 26 states in America, with the situation \\"bordering on catastrophic.\\" One of the industries being heavily impacted is the production of baseball bats, especially bats made by Rawlings in New York state. The iconic brand has been producing their bats from ash wood for more than a century, as sluggers prefer this type of wood for its durability and resistance to shattering. However, with the Emerald Ash Borer threatening the entire species of white ash, plant manager Vander Groef predicts the plant's ash supply will be gone or unaffordable in just three years. The US Forest Service has claimed that few, if any, ash trees will survive in infested areas and has labeled the beetle \\"the most devastating forest insect to reach North America in modern times.\\" While a new pesticide may help attack the beetle's larvae, it is expensive and may not be a fast enough solution. Cities like St. Louis are already preparing to cut down most of their ash trees, with the city planning to remove around 14,000 ash trees, which make up 17% of their tree population. The environmental and economic consequences of this invasive beetle are immense, as ash trees play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystems, providing habitat for many species, and supplying important products to industries based on wood, as seen with the baseball bat industry. Currently, researchers and officials are in the early stages of determining an effective remedy to combat the effects of the Emerald Ash Borer, as time is of the essence to save the ash population and related businesses from disappearing. Approaches such as introducing wasps, the beetle's natural predator, into affected areas may help control the population, but more research and solutions are needed to tackle this ecological crisis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups, and 2 Champions League titles under his belt, Fergie is considered the most successful British football manager ever. His prowess and keen eye for talent also produced some memorable football stars. On the other hand, Raul Gonzalez Blanco, more simply known as Raul, is a retired Spanish professional footballer, widely regarded as one of the finest talents to grace European football. A product of the illustrious Real Madrid youth academy, Raul, during his 16 years at Madrid, scored 323 goals and won numerous titles, including 6 La Liga, 3 UEFA Champions League, and 2 Intercontinental Cups. Raul's heroics for both club and country have cemented his legendary status in the world of football. A Playful Tease – The Spark That Ignited the Flames Rumors of a possible collaboration between these two football giants began when Raul playfully teased Sir Alex Ferguson in an interview. After the question of a possible managerial partnership was broached, Raul simply smiled and said, \\"Come and get me, Fergie!\\" The world took notice, triggering wild speculations for fans and football pundits alike. The age-old saying, \\"there's no smoke without fire,\\" resonates well in this scenario. The fascinating prospect of a union between the legendary football manager and the iconic goal-scoring sensation captured the imagination of football enthusiasts. It is essential to acknowledge Raul's current role as the Real Madrid Castilla (Real Madrid's reserve team) head coach, where he is already nurturing and honing the next generation of superstars. Unraveling the Potential Collaboration –A Football Fantasy If Sir Alex and Raul were to join forces, the possibilities could be staggering. Fergie's experience, tactical aptitude, and expert man-management coupled with Raul's football genius, wealth of experience on the field, and his potential as a successful coach could create an incredible synergy. This collaboration could be historic and potentially lead to the formation of a football dynasty at whichever club they choose to call home. The excitement surrounding a possible partnership will continue to fuel fans' imaginations, but for now, Raul's playful tease remains just that – a tease. Anything is possible in the world of football, and such a union could pave the way for future alliances between legends that transcend the boundaries of club allegiance and national pride. It might just be the beginning of a new chapter in football history. In Conclusion As thrilling as the prospect of Sir Alex Ferguson and Raul Gonzalez collaborating may be, at present, it remains a tantalizing invitation from Raul. While the football world eagerly awaits developments on this potential partnership, it serves as a reminder of the deep respect and admiration between these two legends of the game. Ultimately, whether this playful tease comes to fruition remains to be seen. But the mere thought of their alliance is undeniably a testament to the incredible impact and history that both Fergie and Raul have taken the beautiful game. The hint of their collaborative future will surely captivate the hearts and minds of football enthusiasts for days, weeks, or even months to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both questions are inquiring about the feasibility and current state of technology in relation to constructing an Iron Man suit. However, each one approaches the topic from a slightly different angle and implies slightly different specifics. The first question, \\"Is it possible to build Iron Man suits?\\" is asking whether or not it is currently possible, in general, to create a suit that operates similarly to that of Iron Man's in the Marvel movies. This question seeks to explore the reality of this capability: real-world physical, engineering, and technological constraints and developments are all pertinent to this. On the other hand, the second question, \\"How close is our technology/science to build Iron Man (with Jarvis) kind of suits?\\" is asking for a comparison. It implies a more detailed rundown of the current technologies available that might be relevant to building an Iron Man suit. This question is specifically interested in understanding the proximity of our technological advancements to the technology depicted in the Iron Man suits, both regarding the suit's physical capabilities and the artificial intelligence system (Jarvis) which assists in operating the suit. So, while both questions have the same broad meaning of asking about the feasibility of creating an Iron Man-like suit with our current technology, they differ in the depth and specifics of the information they are seeking. The reality is that certain traits of Iron Man's suit are feasible with current technology, albeit in perhaps less advanced or workable manners. For example, we have exoskeleton suits that can enhance human strength and endurance, jetpack technology that can provide flight, and an increasingly sophisticated AI technology which can perform tasks autonomously. However, synthesizing all of these technologies into a single, compact, highly versatile and responsive suit as portrayed in the Iron Man franchise is far beyond our current capabilities.

Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy. How did the driver spend a good half grand?

Question: Information: - The family Phylliidae (often misspelled Phyllidae) contains the extant true leaf insects or walking leaves, which include some of the most remarkably camouflaged leaf mimics in the entire animal kingdom. They occur from South Asia through Southeast Asia to Australia. At present, there is no consensus as to the preferred classification of this group; some sources treat Phylliidae as a much larger taxon, containing the members of what are presently considered to be several different families. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Camouflage is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling. - The Phasmatodea (also known as Phasmida or Phasmatoptera) are an order of insects, whose members are variously known as stick insects (in Europe and Australasia), stick-bugs or walking sticks (in the United States and Canada), phasmids, ghost insects and leaf insects (generally the family Phylliidae). The group's name is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"phasma\\", meaning an apparition or phantom, referring to the resemblance of many species to sticks or leaves. Their natural camouflage makes them difficult for predators to detect, but many species have a secondary line of defence in the form of startle displays, spines or toxic secretions. The genus \\"Phobaeticus\\" includes the world's longest insects. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Phobaeticus is a genus of stick insects comprising over 25 species. It includes \\"Phobaeticus chani\\", the longest known insect. - Heteropteryx dilatata , also known as jungle nymph , Malaysian stick insect , Malayan jungle nymph , or Malayan wood nymph , is a large member of the Phasmatodea , commonly kept in captivity . It originates in Malaya and is nocturnal . This insect holds the world record for the largest egg laid by an insect . The eggs are about 1.3 cm ( 0.5 in ) in length . - Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica).

Sentence 2: Stepping into the area is peaceful and tranquil. Both sentences share information about stepping into a particular area, and that experience elicits feelings of tranquillity or peace. By comparing these two sentences, it is clear that they convey similar ideas. In Sentence 1, the area is described as an \\"oasis of light, space, cleanliness, and tranquillity\\" following the experience of the \\"claustrophobic rough and tumble\\" of the dimly-lit medieval souqs.

In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B. Which case would see slower movement, case A or case C? A:","completion":"Case C would see slower movement. This is because Jupiter is farther from the Sun than Mars is. As a result, Jupiter's orbital speed is slower due to the decreased gravitational influence from the Sun at a greater distance. Consequently, when John observed Jupiter through his telescope, it appeared to move slower compared to Mars. This behavior can be explained by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. According to the third law, also known as the harmonic law, the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Since Jupiter is farther from the Sun, it has a longer semi-major axis, and therefore, it takes more time to complete one orbit around the Sun as compared to Mars. Moreover, when a planet is farther from its star, it is less affected by the star's gravitational pull, resulting in slower speeds as the distance increases. So, when comparing the movements of Mars (case A) and Jupiter (case C) as seen through John's telescope, Jupiter would appear to be moving slower due to its greater distance from the Sun and slower orbital speed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Typically, they have a knob or a lever that you turn to gradually widen and lengthen the shoe stretcher. Over time, this will help relax and widen the shoe, making them up to a half-size larger. You can buy a shoe stretcher at most high-end shoe stores. Try this in conjunction with a shoe-stretching spray for the best results. Dampen the shoes with the spray, then insert the shoe stretcher. Repeat this as needed until your shoes reach the size you need. Take a sock and roll it up tightly from the toes all the way to the top, then stick it down into the toe box of the shoe. Continue doing this until you’ve filled both shoes completely with as many socks as you can fit. Then, store the shoes overnight or until you’re ready to wear them again. While this method might not work as quickly as using heat, alcohol, or ice, it will gently stretch your shoes over time, making it an ideal option for leather, vintage, or otherwise delicate shoes. This may not work as well for shoes with a stiff upper, like dress shoes. Also, shoes that are made from a flexible material, like mesh, might require direct heat or a method that saturates the shoe in order to stretch out the fibers. Dampen a few sheets of newspaper, then ball them up and stuff them into the toe box of the shoe. Continue adding balls of wet newspaper until the shoe is full. As the paper dries, it will expand and harden, stretching out the shoe. Because this technique will form the shoe as it stretches, be sure to arrange the paper so it preserves the shape of your shoe. Do not saturate the paper, or it could damage the inside of your shoe. Also, avoid using this technique on leather shoes. Fill a plastic bag with oatmeal, rice, or any other grain that will swell up when it gets wet. Add just enough water to cover the grains, then seal the bag and place it into the shoe, working it down into the toe box. Leave the bag in place overnight, then remove it and try your shoes on! As the oats expand, the pressure will help stretch the material of the shoe.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Which would have higher specific gravity, item A or item B? Hint: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... Answer:","completion":"Considering the provided information, it can be concluded that item A (Earth) has a higher specific gravity compared to item B (surface rock). This is based on the fact that Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7 to 3.3). The higher specific gravity in Earth's interior indicates that deeper material is denser than surface rocks, which is also implied by its low moment of inertia. The density increase is not solely due to pressure, as the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals, making it denser than the rocks on the surface."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information: - Akhenre Setepenre Siptah or Merenptah Siptah was the penultimate ruler of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. His father's identity is currently unknown. Both Seti II and Amenmesse have been suggested although the fact that that Siptah later changed his royal name or nomen to Merneptah Siptah after his Year 2 suggests rather than his father was Merneptah. If correct, this would make Siptah and Seti II half-brothers since both of them were sons of Merneptah. - A sarcophagus (plural, sarcophagi) is a box-like funeral receptacle for a corpse, most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word \\"sarcophagus\\" comes from the Greek \\"sarx\\" meaning \\"flesh\\", and \\"phagein\\" meaning \\"to eat\\", hence \\"sarcophagus\\" means \\"flesh-eating\\"; from the phrase \\"lithos sarkophagos\\". Since \\"lithos\\" is Greek for \\"stone\\", \\"lithos sarcophagos\\" means, \\"flesh-eating stone\\". The word also came to refer to a particular kind of limestone that was thought to decompose the flesh of corpses trapped within it. - Not to be confused with Amun - her - khepeshef , a son of Ramesses II , and Amun - her - khepeshef , a son of Ramesses III. The Egyptian prince Amenherkhepshef was the son of Ramesses VI and Queen Nubkhesbed . He lived in the Twentieth dynasty and was buried in the reused sarcophagus of Twosret , in the reused tomb of Chancellor Bay , KV13 , in the Valley of the Kings , on the west bank of the Nile , in Thebes , Egypt . - Nubkhesbed (Gold and Lapis lazuli) was an ancient Egyptian queen of the 20th dynasty. She was the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Ramesses VI and mother of Pharaoh Ramesses VII, Princess Iset (God's Wife of Amun) and Princes Amenherkhepshef and Panebenkemyt. - Limestone is a sedimentary rock, composed mainly of skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, forams and molluscs. Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO). - Ramesses VI Nebmaatre-Meryamun (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the fifth ruler of the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt who reigned from 1145 to 1137 BC and a son of Ramesses III by Iset Ta-Hemdjert. His royal tomb, KV9, is located near Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valley of the Kings. - Iset Ta-Hemdjert or Isis Ta-Hemdjert, simply called Isis in her tomb, was an Ancient Egyptian queen of the twentieth dynasty; the Great Royal Wife of Ramesses III and the Royal Mother of Ramesses VI. - Usermaatre Setepenre Meryamun Ramesses VII (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the sixth pharaoh of the 20th dynasty of Ancient Egypt. He reigned from about 1136 to 1129 BC and was the son of Ramesses VI. Other dates for his reign are 1138-1131 BC. The Turin Accounting Papyrus 1907+1908 is dated to Year 7 III Shemu day 26 of his reign and has been reconstructed to show that 11 full years passed from Year 5 of Ramesses VI to Year 7 of his reign. - Tomb KV13, located in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, was cut and decorated for the burial of the noble Bay of the Nineteenth Dynasty. An ostraca published in the French Egyptological journal BIFAO in 2000 records that Chancellor Bay was executed by pharaoh Siptah. Consequently, Bay was never buried in his tomb. Moreover, no funerary goods were found in the tomb belonging to Bay. It was later reused by Amenherkhepshef and Mentuherkhepsef of the Twentieth Dynasty.

To make baking soda crystals, you start by making a water solution that's saturated with baking soda. The baking soda will dissolve better in warm water.","completion":"To do this, pour some warm water into a pan and bring it to boil. Add the baking soda to the boiling water and stir it until it is completely dissolved. At this point, you should make sure that no baking soda grains remain at the bottom of the pan. Keep adding baking soda until no more can dissolve in the water; this means your water is now saturated with baking soda. Once the solution is ready, let it cool for a few moments then pour it into a clear glass container. The container should be clean and free of dust or any other particles, as any foreign matter can impede the formation of the crystals. You can use a glass jar, a bowl, or any transparent container--just ensure that it provides enough space for the crystals to grow. Next, you'll need to prepare a seeding stick. This is a small object that you'll submerge in your solution to provide a base for the crystal growth. You can use a popsicle stick, a piece of string, a pipe cleaner, or even a fishing line. Dip the stick into the solution and roll it in some baking soda, this will allow crystals to form quicker. Make sure the seeding stick is dry before dipping it into the baking soda and then into the solution. Now, hang the seeding stick into the container of solution. Make sure it's fully immersed but not touching the sides or bottom of the container because you want the crystals to form on the stick and not on the container's surface. Cover the container with a paper towel or coffee filter to prevent dust particles from falling into the solution but still allows the evaporation process to occur; this will aid in the formation of the crystals. The final step is to leave your set-up undisturbed in a cool place. Baking soda crystals should start forming in a few hours, but for best results, it may take up to a week. You will notice that as water evaporates from the solution, more and more baking soda crystals will start forming on the seeding stick. Once your crystals have grown to a size you are happy with, carefully remove the seeding stick from the solution. Let the crystals dry completely by hanging the stick in a cool and dry place. Once they are dry, you now have your own homemade baking soda crystals. Remember not to rush the process. Crystal formation is a slow process and trying to speed it up might result in smaller or less impressive crystals. Practice patience and you will be rewarded with beautiful, shiny baking soda crystals. At last, your baking soda crystals are completed. Crystal growing is a fun and educational project that demonstrates a cool chemical reaction you can do at home. It's a visually gorgeous project that can also stir an interest in science for kids. You have now mastered a basic step in chemistry and created a stunning piece of art you can be proud of.

Brosnan caused a stir in India when he appeared in an ad for Pan Bahar, a product many associate with a highly addictive form of chewing tobacco. He told People magazine he was \\"distressed\\" by the row. He has asked Ashok & Co, the company that produces Pan Bahar, to remove his image from all their advertising. Many have associated Pan Bahar with pan masala and gutka, a potent mixture of tobacco, crushed betel nut, lime, and clove among other ingredients. It is chewed and then spat out in bright red streams by millions of people, who get addicted to its mildly psychotropic effects. Both pan masala and gutka have been linked to cancer, with many Indian states banning their sale and running campaigns to discourage people from buying them. Representatives from Ashok & Co. were not available for comment, and their website displays a sign saying it is \\"under maintenance\\". However, speaking to the BBC when the advert first appeared, the company said the outrage was the result of \\"public misconception\\", adding that there was no tobacco or nicotine in the product. However, such clarifications did little to quell social media anger at the time, with many accusing Brosnan of \\"promoting cancer\\" in endorsing Pan Bahar.

Article: In the year 480 BC the Greek allies faced invasion by the King of Persia,Xerxes,who commanded a huge army of about half a million men. When the Persian army marched into northern Greece,the Greek states,led by Athens and Sparta,were ill equipped to deal with the threat. The Persians were well supplied with food and weapons. Their army included infantry,cavalry,and a large navy. It seemed that they would easily defeat the Greeks. The Greek allies decided to send 10,000 men northwards to slow down the Persians,while the rest prepared to defend their homelands. A group of 300 best Spartan soldiers were chosen to lead the force going north,with Leonidas in command. Leonidas realised that the only hope of slowing the Persians would be to block the narrow passage of land at Thermopylae. The Pass of Thermopylae was the route between the mountains and the sea,and was so narrow that only a few men could get through at a time. When the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae,they found Leonidas' tiny army opposing them. The Persians attacked,but could not get through. They attacked again and again,but each time they were driven back by the Greeks,led by the fearless Spartans. Leonidas'plan worked well until a Greek traitor called Ephialtes went to Xerxes. He told the Persian king about a goat's path in the mountains that would take the Persian army past Thermopylae. When Leonidas saw the enemy crossing the mountains,he realised that he could no longer hold Thermopylae. He sent all the Greek soldiers except the 300 Spartans back to their homelands. The Spartans waited for the 500,000 Persians at the goat's path. Although hopelessly outnumbered,the Spartans fought bravely. They all died,but the other Greeks were able to get home to strengthen the defences. Question: Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?

Write an article with the title: \\"Who deserves the Nobel Peace Prize?\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Who Deserves the Nobel Peace Prize? Introduction The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the most prestigious awards in the world, presented to individuals, groups, or organizations that have made great strides in promoting peace and resolving conflicts. Established in 1895 by the Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to some of the most influential figures in history. The selection criteria as laid down in the will of Alfred Nobel require the laureates to have “done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.” Over the years, notable recipients have included Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela, and Malala Yousafzai. However, determining who deserves the Nobel Peace Prize is a complex matter. This article evaluates the qualities and actions that deem an individual or entity worthy of such an esteemed honor, while also discussing current and potential candidates. The Attributes of a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate 1. Advocacy for peace: The most obvious quality of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate is their dedication to advocating for peace and resolving conflicts through non-violent means. The individual or group must be able to demonstrate commitment, perseverance, and devotion to ensuring that lasting peace is achieved. 2. Championing human rights: A significant number of Nobel Peace Prize laureates have been recognized for their unwavering efforts in promoting and advancing human rights. The individual or organization must serve as a prominent advocate for the rights of all people, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, or social standing. 3. Diplomatic efforts: Individuals or groups who have successfully demonstrated diplomacy and negotiation skills in the interest of global peace are often considered suitable candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize. Diplomatic endeavors should focus on fostering cooperation among nations and promoting a common understanding that transcends disputes and disagreements. 4. Grassroots activism: Sometimes, impactful change begins at the grassroots level. Candidates who have inspired local communities to engage in peaceful and cooperative efforts, which in turn have sparked broader movements, may also be considered worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize. 5. Bringing attention to pressing issues: Many Nobel Peace Prize recipients have been acknowledged for their tireless work in shedding light on pressing global issues, such as nuclear disarmament, climate change, and humanitarian crises. These individuals bring awareness and catalyze discussion, inspiring collective action for peaceful solutions to complex challenges. Current and Potential Candidates 1. Ales Bialiatski, Memorial, and Center for Civil Liberties: The Nobel Committee awarded the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize to human rights defenders Ales Bialiatski, the Russian organization Memorial, and the Ukrainian organization Center for Civil Liberties, for their unwavering commitment to representing and protecting the right to criticize power and protect fundamental rights of citizens. 2. Greta Thunberg: As a prominent climate activist, Greta Thunberg has been instrumental in highlighting the pressing need for global action against climate change. By shedding light on the relationship between environmental sustainability and peace, Thunberg's grassroots activism has inspired millions of people worldwide to join the fight against climate change. 3. Jacinda Ardern: New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, received widespread attention and praise for her compassionate and effective response to the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings. Ardern's leadership in uniting the country following the tragic events, her commitment to reducing gun violence, and her ability to bridge cultural divides may qualify her as a potential candidate for a future Nobel Peace Prize. 4. Abiy Ahmed: The Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts in establishing peace and international cooperation, particularly for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighboring Eritrea. Although his tenure has since been marked by ongoing internal conflict in Ethiopia, his earlier accomplishments should not be overlooked. Conclusion The Nobel Peace Prize is a testament to the power of human resilience, unity, and dedication to achieving peace in the face of adversity. While the list of potential candidates and deserving laureates is constantly evolving, the underlying values remain the same: promoting fraternity between nations, advancing human rights, and laying the foundations for a more peaceful world. It is crucial to continue recognizing and celebrating those who actively work toward these objectives, as they inspire us all to make the world a better place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.

The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson–Harmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894–97, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, stores and provisions, and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew's voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act.The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory's successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition.

The friction will be less between the sandpaper and the glass table or or the sandpaper and the gravel.? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the concept of friction Friction is the force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of such motion of two surfaces in contact. The amount of friction depends on the nature of the two surfaces and the force pressing them together. Generally, rougher surfaces create more friction than smoother surfaces. Step 2: Analyze the given surfaces We have two cases: a) Sandpaper and glass table b) Sandpaper and gravel Step 3: Determine the roughness of each surface a) The glass table has a smoother surface. b) The gravel has a rougher and more irregular surface. Step 4: Compare the friction in both cases Since friction increases with the increase in roughness of the surfaces, rubbing the sandpaper against the gravel will result in more friction because both surfaces (sandpaper and gravel) are rougher. In contrast, rubbing the sandpaper against the glass table will result in less friction because the glass table is a smoother surface. Answer: The friction will be less between the sandpaper and the glass table."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She had a horrible aggressive cancer that ravaged her whole body and needed very regular doses of strong pain relief which - as she had a terminal illness and was receiving end of life care - did not have an upper limit so to speak. She had pain relief as and when needed to make her comfortable and that often results in people ultimately overdosing.

It is not a denial of the betrayal or a justification of what the other person did. It does not guarantee that the other person won’t hurt you again, but it can bring you a sense of power and peace. You can choose not to forgive, but keep in mind that if you dwell on the broken trust, you might experience depression, anxiety, anger, and lack of connection with others. You can forgive someone without reconciling or staying in the relationship. You can start the process of forgiveness by reflecting on how the experience of broken trust has affected you and your relationship to the other person. You can also reflect on the positive times in your relationship. What do you miss about your relationship and how would you like to get back to that? If you get stuck: Consider the other person’s perspective and what you would want if you were in their position. Consider other times and experiences in life where your trust was broken or you broke someone’s trust. How were you able to forgive or were others able to forgive you? Consider journaling, talking to a friend or loved one, or talking to a counselor to help guide you. Instead of replaying and reliving the hurt feelings in your head, try to shift your focus to looking for healthy relationships and experiences that bring you happiness, hope, and peace.If you get overwhelmed in feeling the hurt while you’re trying to forgive, try practicing these techniques to ease your stress level: Deep breathing Meditation Mindfulness exercises Forgiveness is not complete without reflecting on what you’ve learned.

Simon was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Dorothy Simon (nee Ligeti), a homemaker, and Bernard Simon, a former journalist and then public relations director for B'nai B'rith for 20 years. In March 1977, when Simon was still in high school, Simon's father was one of a group of over 140 people held hostage (and later released) in Washington, D.C. by former national secretary of the Nation of Islam Hamaas Abdul Khaalis in the Hanafi Siege. Simon was raised in a Jewish family with roots that originated in Eastern Europe and Hungary (his maternal grandfather had changed his surname from \\"Leibowitz\\" to \\"Ligeti\\"). He has a brother, Gary Simon, and a sister, Linda Evans, who died in 1990. The publishers of Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets were eager for a screen adaptation and submitted it to numerous directors but there was little interest. Simon suggested that they send the book to Baltimore native and film director Barry Levinson. Levinson's assistant Gail Mutrux enjoyed the book and both she and Levinson became attached as producers. The project became the award-winning TV series Homicide: Life on the Street (1993-1999), on which Simon worked as a writer and producer. Simon was asked by Mutrux to write the show's pilot episode but declined, feeling he did not have the necessary expertise. He collaborated with his old college friend David Mills to write the season two premiere \\"Bop Gun\\". The episode was based on a story by executive producer Tom Fontana and featured Robin Williams in a guest starring role that garnered the actor an Emmy nomination. Simon and Mills won the WGA Award for Best Writing in a Drama for the episode. Simon also received Austin Film Festival's Outstanding Television Writer Award in 2010. Simon left his job with the Baltimore Sun in 1995 to work full-time on Homicide: Life on the Street during the production of the show's fourth season. Simon wrote the teleplay for the season four episodes \\"Justice: Part 2\\" and \\"Scene of the Crime\\" (with Anya Epstein). For season five he was the show's story editor and continued to contribute teleplays writing the episodes \\"Bad Medicine\\" and \\"Wu's on First?\\" (again with Epstein). He was credited as a producer on the show's sixth and seventh seasons. He wrote the teleplays for parts two and three of the sixth season premiere \\"Blood Ties\\" (the latter marking his third collaboration with Epstein) and provided the story for the later sixth season episodes \\"Full Court Press\\" and \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" (with James Yoshimura). He provided the story for the seventh season episodes \\"Shades of Gray\\" (with Julie Martin), \\"The Same Coin\\" (again with Yoshimura) and \\"Self Defense\\" (with Eric Overmyer). Simon wrote the story and teleplay for the seventh season episodes \\"The Twenty Percent Solution\\" and \\"Sideshow: Part 2\\". Simon, Martin and teleplay writer T. J.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"No, these sentences do not mean the same thing. There are inaccuracies and inconsistencies between the two statements, which I will point out and explain in detail below. Sentence 1: \\"He played for the Kansas City Royals for ten games during the 1991 Kansas City Royals season and four games during the 1992 Chicago Cubs season.\\" This sentence states that the player in question played for the Kansas City Royals during the 1991 season for ten games. It also states that the same player played four games for the Chicago Cubs during the 1992 season. In summary, the player played for two different teams in two consecutive years – ten games with the Kansas City Royals in 1991 and four games with the Chicago Cubs in 1992. Sentence 2: \\"He played for the Chicago Cubs for ten games in the 1991 season Kansas City Royals and four matches during the 1992 season in Kansas City Royals.\\" This sentence incorrectly states that the player participated in ten games with the Chicago Cubs during the 1991 Kansas City Royals season. It then claims that the player was involved in four matches during the 1992 season with the Kansas City Royals. In this sentence, there are inaccuracies regarding the association between the teams and the seasons, which makes the sentence confusing and contradictory. To reiterate, the sentences are not expressing the same information. The first sentence correctly describes the player's involvement with the Kansas City Royals (1991) and the Chicago Cubs (1992). In contrast, the second sentence inaccurately associates the Chicago Cubs with the 1991 Kansas City Royals season and provides contradictory information about the player's involvement with the two teams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Presidents of the United States have repeatedly asked the Congress to give them a line-item veto power. According to Louis Fisher in The Politics of Shared Power, Ronald Reagan said to Congress in his 1986 State of the Union address, \`\`Tonight I ask you to give me what forty-three governors have: Give me a line-item veto this year. Give me the authority to veto waste, and I'll take the responsibility, I'll make the cuts, I'll take the heat.'' Bill Clinton echoed the request in his State of the Union address in 1995. Congress attempted to grant this power to the president by the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 to control \`\`pork barrel spending'', but in 1998 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act to be unconstitutional in a 6-3 decision in Clinton v. City of New York. The court found that exercise of the line-item veto is tantamount to a unilateral amendment or repeal by the executive of only parts of statutes authorizing federal spending, and therefore violated the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. Thus a federal line-item veto, at least in this particular formulation, would only be possible through a constitutional amendment. Prior to that ruling, President Clinton applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times. Choose your answer: Is the following statement correct based on the text does the president have line item veto power Select from the following.

No. The Local Government (Northern Ireland) Act 1972 mentioned in the text does not involve the country of Argentina. The Act is specifically associated with the region of Northern Ireland, which is a part of the United Kingdom. The Act pertains to the administration of local government districts within Northern Ireland, referencing the creation of twenty-six local government districts by the Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971 and the abolition of the existing local authorities in Northern Ireland. Argentina, a South American country, does not come under the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland or United Kingdom law. Therefore, legislation such as the Local Government (Northern Ireland) Act 1972 does not pertain to Argentina and has no direct impact on its governmental or administrative structures.

This question indicates that the crowd is unsure or confused about what is happening. The hypothesis suggests that the crowd doesn't know why the gathering has been called. Step 3: Analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis Given the information in the premise, the confusion of the crowd is evident. The question asked by the crowd indicates that they do not understand the purpose of the event or what is going on. The hypothesis claims that the crowd has no idea why the gathering has been called.

Finnish: Kun tarkastelen eilen hyväksyttyjen Ecofin-neuvoston päätelmiä, yksi seikka kiinnittää huomioni, ja se on se, etten näe Euroopan komissiolle annettua mandaattia näissä päätelmissä. Tämä antaa vaikutelman siitä, että komissiolla ei ehkä ole erityistä asemaa tai vastuuta tässä asiassa, tai että sen rooli ei ole selkeästi määritelty neuvoston päätöksissä. Ecofin-neuvosto, joka koostuu Euroopan unionin jäsenvaltioiden talous- ja valtiovarainministerien edustajista, keskustelee ja tekee päätöksiä talouspolitiikkaa, finanssialaa ja veroasioita koskevista kysymyksistä. On mahdollista, että komissiolle ei ole annettu erityistä mandaattia tässä tapauksessa, koska jäsenvaltiot haluavat tehdä itse päätöksiä näistä asioista tai koska asia on vielä keskeneräinen ja komission rooli on tarkoitus määritellä myöhemmin. Toisaalta on myös mahdollista, että komission rooli on jätetty tarkoituksella avoimeksi, jotta eri toimielinten välistä yhteistyötä voidaan kehittää joustavammin, ja komissio voi toimia neuvottelijana, asiantuntijana tai valvojana eri tilanteiden ja tarpeiden mukaan.

Tämän vuoksi onkin olennaista käydä jatkuvaa keskustelua, neuvotteluja ja arviointia, jotta EU voi tehdä tehokkaita ja demokraattisia päätöksiä ja vastata jäsenvaltioiden ja kansalaisten tarpeisiin ja odotuksiin."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do you re-post a story on Instagram?","completion":"To re-post a story on Instagram, you can choose between two primary methods: Instagram's built-in sharing feature, or using third-party reposting apps. I will compare both solutions and provide you with a detailed analysis so that you can decide which method suits your needs better. 1. Built-in Sharing Feature: Instagram includes a native feature that allows you to share others' stories to your own story directly if their account is public or if you have permission. To use this feature, follow these steps: Step 1: Launch the Instagram app and view the story you'd like to re-post from your friend or any public account. Step 2: On the bottom right corner of the screen, tap on the Direct (paper airplane) icon. Step 3: A pop-up will appear, allowing you to share the story to your own Instagram story or send it as a direct message to your friends. Choose 'Add to Your Story,' and the post will be shared on your story with proper credits to the original poster. Step 4: You can customize the shared story, including adding stickers, gifs, or text, just as you would do for any regular story. Pros: - It's an Instagram-approved method of sharing stories. - It does not require any additional app or tool. - The re-posted story includes attribution to the original creator. Cons: - You can only re-post stories to which you have access (e.g., from public accounts or if you have permission). - The customization options are limited compared to third-party reposting apps. - You can't save the story permanently in your profile, as it disappears after 24 hours. 2. Third-Party Reposting Apps: An alternative method to re-post stories on Instagram is using third-party reposting apps like Repost for Instagram, StorySaver, or InSaver. These apps allow you to save and share stories from public accounts while giving credit to the original creator. To use these apps, you need to follow the specific instructions provided by each app, which generally involves these steps: Step 1: Download and install the reposting app of your choice from the app store (iOS or Android). Step 2: Log in to your Instagram account via the reposting app. Step 3: Search for the user whose story you want to re-post and select their story. Step 4: Save the story to your device. Step 5: Go back to Instagram and create a new story by uploading the saved content. Step 6: Customize the story as needed, make sure to tag or mention the original creator, and publish it. Pros: - Offers greater flexibility and customization options compared to Instagram's built-in feature. - Allows you to save and re-post stories from your device. - You can use a variety of third-party apps that provide unique features. Cons: - It may violate Instagram's user guidelines since such apps aren't officially recognized by Instagram. - It requires downloading and installing additional apps, which might pose security or privacy risks. - Not all reposting apps are available on both iOS and Android devices. In conclusion, the choice between Instagram's built-in sharing feature or third-party reposting apps depends on your preferences and requirements. If you want an Instagram-approved method of sharing stories with limited customization options, choose the built-in sharing feature. However, if you prefer more flexibility, additional features, and don't mind downloading extra apps, you may opt for third-party reposting apps. Be aware of potential security risks and privacy concerns, and ensure that you have permission to share the stories and give proper credit to the original creator."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges).

The power vacuum resulting from the absence of a ruling monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro II, once he was declared of age, managed to bring peace and stability to the country, which eventually became an emerging international power. Brazil was victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under Pedro II's rule, and the Empire prevailed in several other international disputes and outbreaks of domestic strife. With prosperity and economic development came an influx of European immigration, including Protestants and Jews, although Brazil remained mostly Catholic. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888. Brazilian visual arts, literature and theater developed during this time of progress. Although heavily influenced by European styles that ranged from Neoclassicism to Romanticism, each concept was adapted to create a culture that was uniquely Brazilian. Even though the last four decades of Pedro II's reign were marked by continuous internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither Pedro II nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic. Guess a valid title for it!","completion":"A valid title for this historical context could be: \\"Pedro II and the Transformation of Brazil: Stability, Progress, and the Fall of the Empire.\\" This title encapsulates the crucial role played by Pedro II in fostering stability and growth in Brazil, as well as highlighting the paradoxical decline and eventual collapse of the monarchy under his reign, culminating in the birth of the First Brazilian Republic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Um dies zu erreichen, sollten die Mitgliedstaaten verschiedene Maßnahmen ergreifen, um sicherzustellen, dass ihre Steuergesetze und -richtlinien effektiv und nachhaltig sind. Im Folgenden werden einige mögliche Schritte zur Bekämpfung von aggressiver Steuerplanung und Steuerbasiserosion erläutert. 1. Stärkung der nationalen Steuergesetze: Die Mitgliedstaaten sollten ihre Steuergesetze ständig überprüfen und aktualisieren, um sicherzustellen, dass sie auf dem neuesten Stand sind und die Praktiken der Unternehmen zum Steuernsparen effektiv kontrollieren. Sie sollten auch mögliche Schlupflöcher schließen, die von multinationalen Unternehmen ausgenutzt werden könnten, um ihre Steuerlast zu reduzieren. 2. Internationale Zusammenarbeit: Die Mitgliedstaaten sollten eng mit internationalen Organisationen wie der Organisation für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (OECD) und der Europäischen Union (EU) zusammenarbeiten, um globale Standards und Empfehlungen zur Bekämpfung der Steuerflucht und aggressiver Steuerplanung zu entwickeln. Dies könnte dazu beitragen, dass alle Länder faire und ähnliche Steuergesetze haben, wodurch die Möglichkeiten für Unternehmen, Steueroasen und aggressive Steuerplanung zu nutzen, verringert würden. 3. Austausch von Informationen: Eine verbesserte Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Steuerbehörden der Mitgliedstaaten ist entscheidend, um grenzübergreifende Steuerhinterziehung und -vermeidung effektiv zu bekämpfen. Die Mitgliedstaaten sollten daher den Austausch von Informationen über Steuerzahler und ihre grenzüberschreitenden Geschäfte erleichtern, um Transparenz und Rechenschaftspflicht zu fördern. 4. Steuertransparenz für Unternehmen: Die Mitgliedstaaten sollten Richtlinien einführen, die Unternehmen dazu verpflichten, detaillierte Informationen über ihre Steuerzahlungen und -praktiken offenzulegen. Dies könnte durch die Einführung eines sogenannten \\"Country-by-Country Reporting\\" erreicht werden, bei dem multinationale Unternehmen ihre Steuerzahlungen und Geschäftsaktivitäten für jedes Land, in dem sie tätig sind, offenlegen müssen. 5. Bekämpfung von Steueroasen: Die Mitgliedstaaten sollten gemeinsam gegen Steueroasen vorgehen, indem sie alle Länder, die als solche identifiziert werden, auf eine schwarze Liste setzen und Gegenmaßnahmen ergreifen, um die Nutzung dieser Gebiete für Steuerflucht und -vermeidung zu unterbinden. 6. Förderung von Fairness und Gleichheit: Die Mitgliedstaaten sollten sicherstellen, dass ihre Steuergesetze fair und gerecht sind, indem sie ihre Steuersysteme so gestalten, dass sie alle Bürger und Unternehmen gleich behandeln und keine unfairen Vorteile für bestimmte Gruppen bieten. Letztendlich ist es entscheidend, dass die Mitgliedstaaten ihre Anstrengungen zur Bekämpfung der Steuerbasiserosion durch Missbrauch und aggressive Steuerplanung fortsetzen und intensivieren, um die Integrität und Stabilität ihrer Steuersysteme zu bewahren und das Vertrauen der Steuerzahler in die Steuerbehörden zu stärken."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him.

Write an article based on this summary: – Snowmelt and rain are in abundance for the first time in years in Central Valley, Calif., which boasts so much farmland it helps feed much of the world. But the state's five-year drought was so bad that all those farms sucked up enough groundwater to sink a solid three feet, thereby reducing the region's water storage capacity, reports a new study out of Stanford University. \\"California is getting all of this rain, but in the Central Valley, there has been a loss of space to store it,\\" says a researcher tells Courthouse News; they used satellite technology to precisely calculate the changes in elevation. \\"When too much water is taken out of clay, its structure is rearranged at the microscopic level and it settles into a new configuration that has less storage space.\\" Unfortunately, she adds, that change is irreversible—and extracting groundwater in the future will be harder, \\"like trying to suck water from a really thin straw.\\" The record-setting drought made things dramatically worse fast, but it isn't entirely to blame; farmers have been over-pumping groundwater for decades, reports the Central Valley Business Times. But as the researchers report in the journal Water Resources Research, there are solutions to the problem, including compelling farmers to draw water from the sandy or gravel layers of earth instead of clay, as they are less likely to permanently compact and replenish more easily through rainfall. Researchers are now trying to map Central Valley's sediment layers to better inform future solutions. (There's more silver lining on the drought front.)","completion":"Title: Challenges and Solutions to Water Storage in California's Central Valley Following Severe Drought The Central Valley in California, a rich farmland that helps nourish the planet, is experiencing an influx of precipitation after a prolonged period of drought that extended for five years. However, the drought notably stressed the aquifer systems, causing a conundrum for water storage in the region, reports a recent study by Stanford University. The researchers observe that during the drought, the farms across the Central Valley drew so much groundwater that the land itself sank about three feet. This subsidence reduced the region's groundwater storage capacity. \\"We are seeing a paradoxical situation in California's Central Valley, where despite abundant rainfall and snowmelt this year, there has been a loss of space to store it,\\" commented one of the researchers. Satellite technology was utilized to perform accurate calculations of the changes in elevation resulting from the water extraction. What causes such a phenomenon? The answer lies in the unique characteristics of clay, a common soil component. The process of groundwater extraction rearranges clay at the microscopic level, causing it to settle into a new configuration. Unfortunately, this new layout provides less storage space. The researcher described the change as an irreversible process, adding that extracting groundwater after such a transformation is akin to \\"trying to suck water from a really thin straw.\\" Although the record-breaking, five-year drought has exacerbated the situation dramatically and rapidly, over-pumping is something farmers in the region have practiced for decades, the Central Valley Business Times reports. Thus, the problem is not entirely attributable to recent weather circumstances but is an accumulation of protracted overuse of groundwater resources. The study, published in the Water Resources Research journal, does offer potential remedial measures to rehabilitate the groundwater reservoirs of Central Valley. One proposed solution is to regulate and control the extraction patterns of farmers. Instead of extracting water from clay sediments, farmers should be compelled to draw water from the sandy or gravel layers of the earth. These layers are less susceptible to permanent compaction, conserve more water, and replenish more efficiently through rainfall. In an attempt to develop future strategies, researchers have initiated efforts to map out the sediment layers in the Central Valley. By identifying the distribution and depth of different types of soils, from clay to gravel, a better understanding of the groundwater storage potential of the region can be achieved. This scientific strategy endeavors to restore the valuable groundwater resources that have been so profoundly impacted by the years of drought and overuse. The challenge faced in Central Valley is enormous, given its critical role as a prominent food-producing region. However, the strategies proposed, along with a deeper scientific understanding of the soil and its groundwater storage potential, provide a glimmer of hope. Progressive research and policy-making can safeguard Central Valley's water resources and preserve its vital role as a bounty for the world's tables. As the region seeks for solutions and recovery, it also provides valuable lessons globally on sustainable water resource management in the face of climate change and human overuse."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It has seen multiple evolutions of transportation, from horse-drawn carriages to steam-powered automobiles to high-powered race cars to a Segway. In 1857, one man even counted his steps to the top (16,925). It's been traveled via sled dog team and a camel. In September, motorsports competitor Travis Pastrana zoomed up at 72 mph. For 150 years, the steep, narrow eight-mile road to the 6,288-foot summit of Mount Washington has been delighting and scaring the living daylights out of visitors, with its lack of guardrails and harrowing sheer-cliff drop-offs. To celebrate the Mount Washington Auto Road's anniversary this summer, officials are preparing tributes to daredevils, record-holders and drivers whose only claim to fame is a copy of the bumper sticker, \\"This Car Climbed Mt. Washington.\\" David Roy recently recalled his first trip as a tour guide on the road in 1974. He had driven more than halfway, reciting the road's history when suddenly his two female passengers disappeared from his rearview mirror. They were lying on the seat, afraid to look out. \\"Boy, I wonder if they're all like this,\\" Roy recalls thinking. Visited by about 250,000 people a year, the road up the highest peak in the Northeast is billed as America's oldest manmade tourist attraction. Mount Washington itself has been dubbed \\"Home of the World's Worst Weather\\" for its extreme cold, fog and wind, including a 231 mph gust in 1934 that stood as a world record for more than six decades. This summer, there will be a car race, horseback- and carriage-only days, in addition to motorcycle climbs and foot and bicycle events. The anniversary events got started on Saturday with \\"Alton Weagle Day,\\" who during the 1950s did a series of \\"firsts\\": trips barefoot, blindfolded and backward, then one pushing a wheelbarrow with a 100-pound sack of sugar in it the whole way. Participants on Saturday accomplished their own first-time stunts, such as unicycling, roller skiing and backing a car all the way up. Alton Weagle died in 1984 at age 73. \\"He was always jolly. There wasn't too much that had got him down,\\" recalled Weagle's niece Barbara Weagle, 62, of Groveton. The toll road's story begins in 1853, when Col. David Macomber obtained a charter from the New Hampshire Legislature to build it. The first company to undertake construction blasted a path with black powder — there was no dynamite then — but ran out of money. Another firm, known as the Mount Washington Summit Road Co., took over and still maintains the road. When it opened in Aug. 8, 1861, the crude, dirt road was known as the Mount Washington Carriage Road. Hikers were charged 16 cents, those on horses or driving carriages more. Today, the road is about 80 percent paved, but otherwise hasn't changed much in the intervening 150 years. Visitors can drive themselves or take tours by guides, still called \\"stage drivers.\\" The rate for driving yourself in a car is 25, plus additional fees per passenger. Guided tour rates are a little higher. \\"We've kept it environmentally and aesthetics-wise intact,\\" said Sam Appleton, president and great-great grandson of the original owner. \\"To me, it's important to keep the integrity of it.\\" As a business, the road had its early challenges. In 1869, eight years after it opened, the Mount Washington Cog Railway started bringing passengers to the summit, and ridership in the carriage road started to drop off. \\"It was the modern means of transportation\\" and much faster, notes Howie Wemyss, the road's general manager. The first automobile was driven up on Aug. 31, 1899, by steam-car impresario Freelan Stanley and his wife, who made the ascent in two hours, 10 minutes. Not everyone was a fan of the auto access. In 1904, the first \\"Climb to the Clouds\\" car race was held at the mountain. A Manchester Union Leader editorial lamented, \\"The whole thing is an unmitigated nuisance. The lives and property of perfectly helpless people have been menaced for no reason other than to provide amusement for total strangers. ... If these people think of coming up another year, let 'em stay in jail a couple of days and everyone will be the better for it!\\" Car traffic built slowly, but driving up the road didn't really blossom until after World War II, Wemyss said. Special anniversary events include the return of \\"Climb to the Clouds\\" (June 23-26) after a 10-year absence and a Carriage Road Weekend on July 16-17, during which the road for a time will be open only to horseback riders and horse-drawn carriages. There also will be sunrise drives; a day with hot air balloon rides and pie-eating contests; and a sesquicentennial gala on the weekend of Aug. 6-8. Roy, 60, of Berlin, is looking forward to an August auto road staff reunion. \\"Anybody who drives there and works there — it holds a special place in their heart and mind for all time,\\" he said.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... and the situation: Mike is studying for his zoology class. Today, he is studying about reptiles and amphibians. He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B. Answer the following question: Which class of animals would have weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams, class A or class B?","completion":"Class B (amphibians) would have weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams compared to class A (reptiles). Amphibians, which include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts, have a less developed circulatory system than reptiles. Their heart is typically composed of three chambers: two atria and one ventricle. Due to the presence of only one ventricle, the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood is more likely to occur in amphibians. This results in a less efficient delivery of oxygen throughout their body. On the other hand, reptiles, as described in the given background, have a more advanced circulatory system with a heart that has a septum, more effectively separating the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. This allows for a more efficient respiratory system and better oxygen distribution to the body's tissues. The reptile heart typically has two atria and one partially divided ventricle, providing better separation of the two bloodstreams, although it is still not as effective as the complete separation found in birds and mammals. In conclusion, class B (amphibians) would have weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams when compared to class A (reptiles). This difference in the circulatory system is one of the key factors that distinguishes reptiles and amphibians and contributes to their diverse adaptations and abilities to thrive in various environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework. - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest). - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - A quantum Turing machine (QTM), also a universal quantum computer, is an abstract machine used to model the effect of a quantum computer. It provides a very simple model which captures all of the power of quantum computation. Any quantum algorithm can be expressed formally as a particular quantum Turing machine. Such Turing machines were first proposed in a 1985 article written by Oxford University physicist David Deutsch suggesting quantum gates could function in a similar fashion to traditional digital computing binary logic gates. - Nanotechnology (\\"nanotech\\") is manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form \\"nanotechnologies\\" as well as \\"nanoscale technologies\\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars. - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. - David Elieser Deutsch, FRS (born 18 May 1953), is an Israeli-born British physicist at the University of Oxford. He is a Visiting Professor in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the Centre for Quantum Computation (CQC) in the Clarendon Laboratory of the University of Oxford. He pioneered the field of quantum computation by formulating a description for a quantum Turing machine, as well as specifying an algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer. He is a proponent of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. - Ithaca is a city in the Southern Tier-Finger Lakes region of New York. It is the seat of Tompkins County, as well as the largest community in the Ithaca-Tompkins County metropolitan area. This area contains the municipalities of the Town of Ithaca, the village of Cayuga Heights, and other towns and villages in Tompkins County. The city of Ithaca is located on the southern shore of Cayuga Lake, in Central New York. It is named for the Greek island of Ithaca. - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968. - The MIT Media Lab is an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology devoted to projects at the convergence of technology, multimedia, sciences, art and design. Staff and students have backgrounds ranging from electrical engineering and computer science to sociology and music and others. The Media Lab has been widely popularized since the 1990s by business and technology publications such as \\"Wired\\" and \\"Red Herring\\" for a series of practical inventions in the fields of wireless networks, field sensing, web browsers and the World Wide Web. , it has diversified its research into neurobiology, biologically inspired fabrication, socially engaging robots, emotive computing, bionics, and hyperinstruments. The One Laptop per Child (OLPC) was one of the notable research efforts which grew out of the Media Lab. - Physical Review Letters (PRL), established in 1958, is a peer-reviewed, scientific journal that is published 52 times per year by the American Physical Society. As also confirmed by various measurement standards, which include the \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" impact factor and the journal h-index proposed by Google Scholar, many physicists and other scientists consider \\"Physical Review Letters\\" one of the most prestigious journals in the field of physics. - The American Physical Society (APS) is the world's second largest organization of physicists. The Society publishes more than a dozen scientific journals, including the prestigious \\"Physical Review\\" and \\"Physical Review Letters\\", and organizes more than twenty science meetings each year. APS is a member society of the American Institute of Physics. - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown. - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current campus opened in 1916 and extends over along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. 'neil gershenfeld' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'employer'?

Answer:","completion":"Clayne Crawford plays the character Martin Riggs in the television series Lethal Weapon. Lethal Weapon is an American buddy cop action-comedy-drama television series that premiered on Fox on September 21, 2016. The show is based on the Lethal Weapon film series, which was created by Shane Black and stars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as Los Angeles Police Department detectives Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. In the TV series, Clayne Crawford takes on the role of Martin Riggs, originally portrayed by Mel Gibson in the films. Crawford's portrayal of Riggs is similar to Gibson's version, as both share the same tragic backstory and penchant for reckless, impulsive behavior. Riggs is a former Navy SEAL and a Texas cop who moves to Los Angeles after the death of his wife and unborn child. He is partnered with Detective Roger Murtaugh (played by Damon Wayans in the TV series), and together they solve various crimes while navigating their own personal struggles. Clayne Crawford is an American actor known for his work in various television shows and films. Before landing the role of Riggs in Lethal Weapon, Crawford appeared in TV series such as 24, NCIS: New Orleans, Justified, and Rectify. In addition to his television work, he has also acted in films like A Walk to Remember, Swimfan, The Great Raid, and The Perfect Host. However, it is important to note that Clayne Crawford was removed from the show after the second season due to allegations of on-set conflicts and issues with his behavior. As a result, the character of Martin Riggs was killed off, and Seann William Scott was brought in to play a new character, Wesley Cole, who partnered with Roger Murtaugh for the third season.

Question: Who is the aging high priest of Arkam? Title: The Mummy's Ghost Movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

Though you are likely working towards more comprehensive accomplishments, specific goals are more helpful for study sessions. Avoid vague, immeasurable goals such as “Read for philosophy class.” Instead, give yourself the goal of reading 15 pages of Sartre and writing a few paragraphs about the test. Similarly, instead of “study for biology exam,” establish the goal to “complete 2 of chapter three’s worksheets.” In order to be achievable, your goals should take a short, realistic amount of time to reach. Establishing the goal of studying for 28 hours next week doesn’t actually help you study for 30 hours next. However, deciding to study 4 hours every day next week can help compel you to reach 28 hours of studying! You’re already planning on starting a paper tomorrow and it’s already late. However, an idea occurs to you. Take advantage of moments such as these by sitting down to record your thoughts. You don’t necessarily need to start writing, but you can get a head start on tomorrow’s tasks by reading the paper’s prompt and nailing down your specific topic. Carry around a small notebook and pen at all times or use the Notes app on your phone. Break up any study session longer than 90 minutes. In fact, plan to study for only 45-90 minutes at a time, with 10-15 minutes breaks in between focused sessions. Try to establish a schedule that incorporates 3 total hours of studying each day, broken into multiple study sessions. If possible, study during the day, as opposed to the evening, as your mind will be able to focus better and your memory will retain more. Once a month, spend a few minutes reflecting on your long-term goals. Are the ways you’re spending your time contributing to the achievement of those goals? If not, look for ways to tweak your schedule and behavior to ensure you’re on track to meet your goals both short and long term.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where did Imogen study piano with Elanor Shuttleworth? ? Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922. In July 1922 she performed a Bach Prelude and Fugue on the piano, for which Joseph praised her warmly, writing: \\"I think everyone enjoyed the Bach from beginning to end, they all made nice contented noises at the...

The wolf is a native predator of the northern hemisphere, including a wide range of Eurasia and North America, and has the highest geographical distribution among all other canids. The wild ancestor of the dog, dogs, descended from a species of wolf that was domesticated between 18,000 and 32,000 years ago. To date, 37 subspecies of the wolf have been identified, including domestic dogs, dingoes, red wolves, and Iranian wolves. Most wolves are gray with patches of other colors, but white, red, brown, and black colors are also seen in them. The size and weight of wolves vary greatly in different areas, with wolves generally having a larger stature at higher latitudes (northern regions). The Russian wolf or tundra wolf is one of the largest types of wolf, with an average weight of approximately 90 to 130 kilograms. Wolves have specialized more in hunting larger animals compared to their close relatives, such as the golden jackal and coyote. They have a greater interest in social life and benefit from a rich and complex behavioral language. Question: What color is a wolf? Answer: True"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long did the affair, if true, between Trump and the adult film star most likely continue? Options: A. a few weeks B. not enough information C. one night D. several months to a couple of years Answer:","completion":"B. not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I heard that Carson found help nearby and got the yard mowed in an hour. And I was wondering How would Carson feel afterwards? The answer is:","completion":"To determine how Carson would feel after completing the yard mowing task in an hour, let's consider the following steps: Step 1: Analyze the situation Carson found help nearby and was able to complete the yard mowing in an hour. This suggests that the task was accomplished more quickly and maybe more efficiently than if Carson had done it alone. Step 2: Consider possible emotions Carson could experience a variety of emotions after completing the task, especially given that he sought help nearby. Some potential emotions include: - Relief: The task is finished, so Carson no longer has to worry about it. - Satisfaction: Carson took initiative in seeking help and accomplished the job in a timely manner. - Gratitude: Carson could be thankful for the person who helped him with the task. - Tiredness: Mowing a yard could be physically exhausting, especially if it’s a large yard or if the weather conditions were challenging. Step 3: Weigh the emotions and draw a conclusion Given the context, Carson is likely to feel a combination of relief, satisfaction, and gratitude after completing the yard mowing task in an hour with help from someone nearby. There may also be some tiredness, though the presence of help could have lessened the physical strain.

In fact, most motions in nature follow curved paths rather than straight lines. Motion along a curved path on a flat surface or a plane (such as that of a ball on a pool table or a skater on an ice rink) is two-dimensional, and thus described by two-dimensional kinematics. Motion not confined to a plane, such as a car following a winding mountain road, is described by three-dimensional kinematics. Both two- and threedimensional kinematics are simple extensions of the one-dimensional kinematics developed for straight-line motion in the previous chapter. This simple extension will allow us to apply physics to many more situations, and it will also yield unexpected insights about nature.

Article: At first, the earth's surface layer was made up of huge blocks of hard, solid rocks. Then slowly, the rocks broke up into smaller and smaller pieces. Finally stones, pebbles and grains of sand were formed. Many sorts of plants and animals lived and died on the surface of the earth. Their remains mixed up with the stones, pebbles and formed soil. The outmost layer of the earth is soil. There are many ways in which large pieces of rock break into smaller ones. Wind, water, heat and cold help to break up rocks. When winds blow grains of sand against a large rock for a long time, the softer layers of the rock are slowly worn away. These leave holes and cracks in the rock, which become bigger and finally the rock breaks up into smaller pieces. The moving water of streams and rivers also helps to break up rocks. As the water moves along, it carries with it small pieces of rock. These rub the larger ones. Thus, the larger rocks are worn down to smaller pieces. The heat of the sun is also helpful to breaking up rocks. When the sun shines, the rocks become very hot. If these rocks are suddenly cooled, they may crack. Ice also plays a part in making soil. Water in the cracks can turn into ice in cold weather. As this happens, it becomes bigger and the cracks become wider, and finally break into smaller pieces. Question: Which of the following speeds up the breaks of rocks most? Answer: Answer:","completion":"There isn't a single factor that speeds up the process of breaking rocks the most, as various factors contribute to the breaking of rocks. These factors include wind, water, heat and cold, and ice. Each factor plays a unique role in breaking down rocks, and their combined effects influence the rate at which rocks break, forming stones, pebbles, and grains of sand."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"What does a hairy organism have under its skin to help insulate the body?\\" and the following answer choices: - fat - hair - food - cell - nerves - coat - fur - marrow Now knowing that mammals have a layer of fat under the skin to help insulate the body and if it has hair it is a mammal, choose the best answer. A:","completion":"The best answer for the question \\"What does a hairy organism have under its skin to help insulate the body?\\" would be fat. This is because mammals, which are identified by the presence of hair on their bodies, have a layer of subcutaneous fat beneath their skin that functions as an insulator to conserve body heat and maintain a consistent internal temperature. Hair provides an initial layer of insulation by trapping air close to the skin, creating an insulating barrier. However, it is the layer of subcutaneous fat underneath the skin that is the primary component responsible for insulation in mammals. In addition to insulation, subcutaneous fat also serves several other important functions as part of the integumentary system, which is comprised of the skin, hair, nails, and sweat glands. These functions include energy storage, cushioning and protection of internal organs, as well as facilitating the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Despite the presence of hair as an identifying characteristic of mammals, it is essential to note that the mere existence of hair does not automatically guarantee that it acts as an effective insulating layer. For example, some mammals, such as elephants and rhinoceroses, have sparse hair covering their bodies, and rely more on their thick skin and fat to insulate and protect themselves from the environment. In summary, among the answer choices provided, fat is the most accurate answer to the question, considering that hairy organisms are mammals and mammals possess a layer of subcutaneous fat beneath their skin that serves as an insulator for body heat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Paul McCartney has never dwelled in yesterday, even if he remembers it quite well. At 71, he's just released his 24th post-Beatles album, \\"New,\\" and is generating music at a pace that puts artists a quarter of his age to shame. And in a remarkably candid cover story by Rolling Stone contributing editor Jonah Weiner (on newsstands Friday October 25) McCartney discusses the drive that keeps him creating fresh music — as well as the memories of his Beatles bandmates that continue to shape his life today. Look back at Paul McCartney's remarkable career in photos Perhaps most shockingly, McCartney reveals that although he's always teaming up with fresh talent — \\"New\\" features production by Adele collaborator Paul Epworth, Amy Winehouse producer Mark Ronson, Giles Martin (son of legendary Beatles producer George) and frequent Kings of Leon partner Ethan Johns — he also consulted with another source, someone who knows his music intimately: John Lennon. See where your favorite tracks rank on","completion":"our list of the 100 greatest Beatles songs of all time. In the interview, McCartney opens up about how he still communicates with his late bandmate John Lennon through a form of dreams and spiritual connection, seeking advice and critique on his current work. Though Lennon passed away tragically in 1980, McCartney explains that he has always felt a deep connection to him, and the musical bond they shared guides him to this day. \\"Whenever I'm unsure about something with my music, I think about what John would say, and it helps put things in perspective,\\" McCartney reveals to Rolling Stone. He also elaborates on how these connections with Lennon have influenced some of his standout moments in his \\"New\\" album. Fans and critics alike have noted that several tracks bear a strong resemblance to the traditional Beatles sound that only Lennon and McCartney could create together. The pair's relationship was not without its ups and downs. The late 1960s and early 1970s were marked by several legal and financial feuds, as well as the famous artistic differences that ultimately led to the Beatles' breakup. But as McCartney shares, the bond they had built over the years could never truly be severed. In fact, he admits he was devastated when Lennon was killed and confides that he thinks about Lennon every day. The Rolling Stone article goes on to explore McCartney's current thoughts on another Beatles bandmate, Ringo Starr, and his relationship with the late George Harrison. Despite the band's tumultuous past, McCartney speaks highly of his surviving former bandmate and expresses regret over the loss of Harrison. He credits the Beatles' experiences, both good and bad, for shaping the person he is today. In light of the insights and emotions revealed within the interview, it’s no wonder that McCartney's 24th album has been met with critical acclaim. With tracks that include innovative partnerships with today's top producers and a newfound connection with Lennon, \\"New\\" serves as a testament to an artist who, at 71 years old, still continues to reinvent himself and push the boundaries of music. For those who are curious about the album, it's available now for purchase and streaming. Additionally, dates and locations for McCartney's ongoing world tour can be found on his official website. Although the younger generation may not have experienced the Beatles in their heyday, fans both old and new can find joy in the continued evolution of an artist who has transcended the boundaries of time and still manages to create inspiring music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a string and you should find the longest substring that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that is the same backwards as it is forwards. If the shortest possible palindrome is length 1 you should return the first character. Problem:fccfhfchfchhh Solution:","completion":"To find the longest palindrome from the given string \\"fccfhfchfchhh\\", I followed these steps using the definition of a palindrome: 1. First, understand that a palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. 2. Initialize a variable to track the longest palindrome found, initially setting it to the first character \\"f\\" (as the task requires to return the first character if the shortest possible palindrome is of length 1). 3. Iterate through the string to check for palindromes of various lengths. One can start by checking for palindromes of length 2 and then move on to length 3, 4, and so on. This can be done using two nested loops: - The outer loop iterates through the string. - The inner loop iterates through different lengths of substrings, starting with length 2. 4. In each iteration, check if the current substring is a palindrome by comparing the first and last characters of the substring. If they are the same, continue comparing the second and second-last characters, and so on. If all pairs of characters are the same, the substring is a palindrome. 5. If a palindrome is found and its length is greater than the length of the previously stored longest palindrome, update the longest palindrome. 6. Continue iterating through the string until all possible substrings have been checked. 7. Return the longest palindrome found.

Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3.

Alternatively, preheat a gas grill. Check the grill before beginning. Article:","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Cleaning and Preparing Your Grill for Optimal Performance Introduction Summertime is synonymous with barbecues, and there's no better feeling than the aroma of sizzling burgers and perfectly grilled vegetables in the air. To ensure that you achieve those desired grill marks and delectable flavors, it's essential to clean and correctly prepare your grill. In this article, you will find a step-by-step guide to cleaning and prepping your grill grate using either a charcoal or gas grill. Step 1: Scrub the Grill Grate The first step in the cleaning process is to thoroughly scrub the grill grate. This step is critical because removing the remnants of previous cookouts helps to avoid flare-ups and achieve an even, steady heat. It also guarantees that your food will not stick to the grate during grilling, which ensures that your mouthwatering meals will remain intact for all to enjoy. It is best to use a heavy-duty grill brush designed explicitly for this purpose. Ensure that the brush has strong and sturdy bristles made of stainless steel or brass, which will guarantee your grate is properly cleaned without causing any damage to the surface. To begin, warm the grill for a few minutes to loosen any residual grease and grime. Next, scrub the grate forcefully using your grill brush, ensuring you cover the entire surface. Pay extra attention to areas with stubborn residue, as these particles can significantly impact the taste and quality of your grilled dishes. Step 2: Coat the Grill Grate with Canola Oil Once the grill grate has been thoroughly scrubbed and all remnants of previous cookouts have been removed, it's time to coat it with canola oil. This step helps to further prevent your food from sticking to the grate as well as maintain its non-stick quality. To coat the grill grate with canola oil, dampen a paper towel or clean cloth with a generous amount of oil. Using a pair of grill tongs, carefully rub the oil-damped towel or cloth onto the hot grate, ensuring that the entire surface is evenly coated. Be prepared for some billowing smoke during this process, as that is normal. Step 3: Preheat a Charcoal Grill or a Gas Grill The third step involves preheating your grill. You can choose between a charcoal grill or a gas grill, depending on your preference and the type of grill you own. Preheating the grill is crucial because it ensures that the food sears quickly on the surface, which locks in the juices and robust flavors. For a charcoal grill, stack the charcoal briquettes in a pyramid shape and light them using a charcoal chimney or lighter fluid. Allow the charcoal to become completely covered with white-gray ash, which usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Once this occurs, spread the hot coals evenly across the grill's bottom and place the oiled grate on top. For a gas grill, turn on the burners to high heat and close the lid. Allow the grill to heat for about 10-15 minutes. After preheating, adjust the temperature to your desired level before starting to cook. Step 4: Check the Grill Before Beginning Before you begin grilling your culinary masterpieces, it's essential to double-check the grill conditions. Make sure the grate is clean and properly oiled to avoid wastage of ingredients and ensure that your food will turn out as desired. Conclusion Having a clean and well-prepared grill is crucial for achieving perfect backyard barbecues this summer. By following the steps outlined in this article, you will ensure a clean, well-oiled, and hot grill, thus resulting in consistently delicious and mouthwatering dishes. So, grab your favorite grill tools, don your apron, and get ready to impress your family and friends with your grilling skills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. I am facing a new situation today: Two new planets have just been discovered in our solar system. Scientists have just landed on both and are in the process of analyzing the environment and atmosphere of each planet. What is immediately apparent is that both planets are remarkably similar to Earth since both are oxygen rich and do not require a space suit to breathe. Another similarity that one of the planets, Jarthrow, has with Earth is that it naturally outputs approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as Earth does. The other planet, Millhouse, outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases. Climate scientists are rushing to try to see if anything new can be discovered to help out our planet with these new discoveries. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Will Millhouse have a higher or lower temperature than Jarthrow? A:","completion":"Based on the information from the background article about the greenhouse effect and the details provided about the two planets, Millhouse and Jarthrow, I will determine which planet will have a higher or lower temperature. Step 1: Understand the greenhouse effect on both planets The greenhouse effect describes how greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) trap heat from the sun, leading to an increase in global temperature. When there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, causing an increase in temperature. Step 2: Compare the greenhouse gas outputs of both planets Jarthrow outputs the same amount of greenhouse gases as Earth, while Millhouse outputs twice as many greenhouse gases compared to Earth and Jarthrow. Step 3: Evaluate the impact of greenhouse gas outputs on each planet's temperature Given that Millhouse has a higher output of greenhouse gases, it is expected that it will trap more terrestrial radiation, leading to a higher temperature on Millhouse compared to Jarthrow. Step 4: Determine the answer to the question Since Millhouse outputs more greenhouse gases, it will experience a more significant greenhouse effect, thus resulting in a higher temperature compared to Jarthrow. Answer: Millhouse will have a higher temperature than Jarthrow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

In Nazi Germany, propaganda took various forms, including a seemingly innocuous board game designed to indoctrinate children into the idea of conquering Britain with U-boats, bombers, and fighter planes. In this article, we delve into this historical artifact and explore how it was used to brainwash young Germans. Step 1: Provide Background on Nazi Propaganda Nazi propaganda was a crucial element in Adolf Hitler's rise to power and his regime's control over the German population. Led by Joseph Goebbels, the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda developed strategies to promote Nazi ideology, suppress dissent, and manipulate public opinion. This included films, radio broadcasts, posters, newspapers, and even children's toys and games. Step 2: Introduce the Board Game Among the myriad propaganda tools was a board game called 'U-Boat, Bomber, and Fighter Plane,' released in the late 1930s. Cleverly disguised as an engaging children's game, it instilled in young Germans a sense of nationalistic pride, military strategy, and hostility towards enemies like Britain. With its striking visuals and interactive gameplay, the board game became a wildly popular household item. Step 3: Describe the Gameplay and Mechanics The game was played on an illustrated map of the Atlantic Ocean, which included Europe's coastlines. German players controlled units such as U-boats, bombers, and fighter planes, while the enemy forces were represented by British ships and aircraft. The objective of the game was to conquer Britain by destroying its military forces and occupying its cities, including London. To achieve this goal, players needed to plan attacks, allocate resources, and make strategic decisions. Step 4: Analyze the Propaganda Elements The game reinforced several key Nazi beliefs. First, it emphasized Germany's military prowess, positioning them as a powerful force capable of toppling great nations like Britain. Second, it portrayed the enemy as weak and vulnerable, ripe for conquest. Third, it created a sense of camaraderie among the players, who were all working towards the shared goal of dominating Europe in the name of the Fatherland. Step 5: Discuss the Impact on Children The genius of the board game as a propaganda tool was its ability to merge fun and indoctrination. By engaging children in an interactive manner, it subtly injected Nazi ideology into their formative years. Moreover, the game's popularity ensured that it was not only played in homes but also in schools and youth clubs, thereby reaching a broad swath of Germany's youth. Conclusion: The creation of 'U-boats, Bombers, and Fighter Planes' demonstrates the sinister depths to which the Nazi regime was willing to go in its pursuit of control and manipulation. By exploiting the innocence of childhood through seemingly harmless board games, the Nazis sought to shape the minds of an entire generation in their own image. Such tactics serve as a stark reminder of the dark powers of propaganda and the importance of vigilance against them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The wreckers are responsible for a series of engineered shipwrecks in which they extinguish coastal warning beacons to cause ships to run aground on the rocky Cornish coast. Then they kill the surviving sailors and steal the cargo from the wrecks. Beautiful, young Mary Yellan (Maureen O'Hara) is travelling to Jamaica Inn in a carriage, but the driver is afraid to stop there and drives a long way past the inn in spite of her repeated demands that he stop. Instead, he drops her off near the home of the local squire and justice of the peace, Sir Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton).

Patience is distraught to learn her sister, Mary's mother, has died. When Mary tells Joss that Pengallan has accompanied her to Jamaica Inn, Joss goes upstairs and reports to Pengallan. We learn that Pengallan is the secret criminal mastermind behind the wrecking gang, who finds out when well-laden ships are passing near the coast, determines when and where the wrecks are to be done, disposes of the stolen cargo, and uses the booty to support his lavish lifestyle, passing a small fraction of the takings back to Joss and the gang.

In his test, Troy (J. Larose) was to rip chains from his body in order to flee from a bomb; however, the door to the room was sealed, making the trap inescapable and thus going against Jigsaw's methods. Kerry, who feels guilty over Matthews' disappearance, later awakens in a harness hooked into her ribs. A key to unlock the device is within a beaker of acid; though she retrieves it, the device still tears her ribcage apart in opposite directions, making her trap inescapable as well.Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), a man who seeks vengeance for the death of his son, and Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh), a depressed doctor, are also kidnapped under John Kramer's (Tobin Bell) orders.

Do you want to know exactly what it is, who created it, and how to open it? AMP files can refer to different file types, and while it might be confusing at first, it's essential to identify the specific file type you have in order to utilize it effectively. Let's dive into three main types of AMP files, their creators, and methods to open and use them. 1. Adobe Audition Noise Print File (.amp) This type of AMP file is primarily used in Adobe Audition, which is a professional digital audio workstation created by Adobe Systems. An Adobe Audition Noise Print File stores sound wave data used for noise reduction. The software analyzes the audio and generates a \\"noise print\\" that helps users eliminate unwanted noise and improve the overall sound quality. To open this .amp file, you will need to install Adobe Audition software on your computer, which can be downloaded from the official Adobe website (https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html). Once installed, you can use the software to import and work with the .amp noise print file to enhance your audio file's clarity. 2. Joomla! AMP Package File (.amp) Joomla! is a popular content management system (CMS) used to create and manage websites. The AMP Package File is created by Joomla! and is an extension file used to enhance the site's functionality by providing Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) support. It is developed to optimize the mobile browsing experience, offering faster loading times and improved performance. To work with this .amp file, you should have a Joomla! website and access to your hosting cPanel or an FTP client like FileZilla. You can install and integrate the .amp package within your Joomla! installation to enable AMP support for your website. The official Joomla! documentation (https://docs.joomla.org/Main_Page) provides the necessary steps for installing and setting up extensions. 3. Alphacam 2D Machining Parametric Data File (.amp) Alphacam is a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software created by Planit Solutions. It is primarily used in the woodworking, metal, and stone cutting industries. The .amp file in Alphacam is a 2D machining parametric data file that stores information about toolpath generation, tool parameters, and machining operations. To open and work with this type of .amp file, you will need to install Alphacam software on your computer, available through the official Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence website (https://www.hexagonmi.com/en-GB/products/production-software/products/alphacam).

In building bridges, American engineers calculate so finely and exactly as to make the two ends come together within one-tenth of an inch. But when two Chinese begin to dig a tunnel from both sides of a mountain both come out on the other side. --The Chinese's firm belief is that it doesn't matter so long as a tunnel is dug through, and if we have two instead of one, why, we have a double track to boot. The pace of modern industrial life forbids this kind of glorious and magnificent idling.

(This sort of thing is bound to come to China, as is evident, for instance, in the case of a factory of twenty thousand worker. The luxurious prospect of twenty thousand workers coming in at their own sweet pleasure at all hours is, of course, somewhat terrifying.)Nevertheless, such efficiency is what makes life so hard and full of excitement. A man who has to be punctually at a certain place at five o'clock has the whole afternoon from one to five ruined for him already.

For instance, how, in an age of constant tracking, could it have vanished? And how could it have fallen from the sky? A look around at some of the answers being offered up: The Washington Post explains how it might have dropped off the grid. Radar can only reach so far. Passengers' cell phones can't necessarily connect to networks in the air. And Malaysia Airlines doesn't seem to carry WiFi. As for the maps passengers see on the backs of seats, those track planes' activity via ground stations and would probably lack any information we don't already have. What about the black box? Businessweek wonders. Why is that data kept inside a plane where we can't get to it, rather than transmitted from the plane? Mainly because of cost, the site explains. It would cost an airline 300 million per year to send out all that data. And airlines aren't likely to spend that money as disasters become rarer. But how did the plane fall mid-flight, anyway? NPR notes a few factors that can affect a jet while it's in the air. One is mechanical stress from the cabin's pressurization and depressurization. But maintenance usually addresses that, and the Boeing 777 in question had recently been inspected. Technical failure is unlikely in today's aircraft, which are protected with back-up systems. Human error remains a possibility, but the most common issue while in flight is sabotage, an expert says. Expand this summary.","completion":"The mysterious disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines flight has resulted in a flurry of numerous queries and speculations, including how it disappeared despite the constant modern tracking techniques. One of the most prominent questions being, how could it have simply vanished from the sky? Several theories and answers are currently being tossed around. For instance, The Washington Post offered a logical explanation for its sudden disappearance from the radar. Radar systems, regardless of their perceived sophistication, have limited reach. Additionally, this specific situation's complexity is multiplied by the fact that passengers' cell phones can't necessarily connect to networks while in the air, effectively further mystifying the case. What magnifies this mystery is that Malaysia Airlines reportedly does not offer WiFi. This eliminates the possibility of any internet-based tracking. As for the GPS maps passengers often access on the backs of seats, those generally work via ground stations and would typically not store any other data apart from what we already have. The main question comes - what about the airplane's black box, which is expected to store crucial flight data? Businessweek expresses wonder about why such crucial data is stored in an aircraft where accessibility post-incident can be a significant challenge. Instead, they question, wouldn't it be more convenient to transmit the data directly from the plane? However, they also explain the limiting factor - money. The cost implications for an airline to transmit all that data total around 300 million a year. With the decline in air disasters, it's improbable that airlines would willingly undertake such a significant expense. The manner in which the plane descended mid-flight has also perplexed many. NPR points out several factors that could potentially impact a flying jet. One of these factors is the mechanical stress the aircraft goes through due to the cycles of cabin pressurization and depressurization. However, such issues are usually handled during regular maintenance, and it's crucial to note that the Boeing 777 involved had been recently inspected. Generally, technical failure in contemporary aircraft is rare due to the robust backup systems in place. Human error, while a possibility, is often not the most common issue during flights. Unfortunately, one disconcerting yet possible cause that an expert cites is sabotage, a factor that has historically been the most common issue while in flight. The mystery, as of now, continues to remain unsolved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

While attending my MOS AIT in the US Army (good lord, was that 25 years ago???), a few of us had a hotel party. It didn’t get too crazy as it was mainly to get off post. If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over. I had known them all for a month or so and had spent a ton of time hanging out at the barracks or around the school area. The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed. About the time everyone started to nod off, one of the girls woke me, asking if I would share the blanket, as the bed was too crowded. She and I had both recently gotten engaged to people two plane flights away and had been nothing more than friends previously - with no hint of anything else… I thought nothing of it and said sure. After a few minutes, she said she couldn’t sleep and asked if she could snuggle up a little. I thought nothing of it and said sure. I started to think… hunh… this is peculiar… After a few more minutes, she asked if I minded if we kissed a little. At that point, I started to get the idea… but that was as far as I thought anything was going to happen as I thought, hunh, OK, maybe she misses her fiance. I know I do. Then we progressed to (very quiet) sex at her request. As far as we knew, everyone else in the room was asleep - at least they never hinted at knowing.

George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City's homeless population, specifically those known as \\"undergrounders\\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. A police captain named Bosch (Christopher Curry) is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons (most of whom are homeless) being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. \\"The Reverend\\" Shepherd (Daniel Stern), who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes in order to feed.

A damning report from the Australian Human Rights Commission has found that hundreds of children threatened to or committed self harm in immigration detention. In a ten-month long inquiry, the Commission found that Australia's practice of holding children in detention violates human rights law, and recommended that they should be released as soon as possible into the community. The long-awaited report, titles 'The Forgotten Children', called for a royal commission into the treatment of children in immigration detention after concluding that prolonged detainment caused significant mental and physical harm. Scroll down for video. The Australian Human Rights Commission has found that hundreds of children threatened to or committed self harm in immigration detention. Hundreds of assaults against children were reported and 128 teenagers harmed themselves between January 2013 and March 2014. Commission President Gillian Triggs said that the Australian government's amendments to the Migration Act which redefined the term 'refugee' was of 'profound concern'. 'It is imperative that Australian governments never again use the lives of children to achieve political or strategic advantage,' she said. 'The aims of stopping people smugglers and deaths at sea do not justify the cruel and illegal means adopted,' she told SBS. 'Australia is better than this.' The report stated that 'there appears to be no rational explanation for the prolonged detention of children.' The report, released on Wednesday, stated that 'The mandatory and prolonged immigration detention of children is in clear violation of international human rights law.' A picture drawn by a 14-year-old detained at the Christmas Island Detention Centre. A picture drawn by a six-year-old detained at the Christmas Island Detention Centre. The commission called for the Federal government to ban indefinite detention, close the 'harsh and cramped' Christmas Island immigration centre, get children off Nauru and appoint an independent guardian for unaccompanied minors. However, Attorney-General George Brandis told parliament that the recommendations had been a longstanding point of difference between the government and the commission. 'The government does not accept the commission's findings,' he said. Mr Brandis said that the Federal government had made 'significant progress' towards changing the conditions of detention centres since the Commission's inquiry had started. 'In short, children in detention is a problem created exclusively by the former Labor Government, which has largely been solved by the current Abbott Government,' he told SBS. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton (left) took on the job in late December and said many of the recommendations reflected existing government policies and were superfluous. Greens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said the report must be the turning point to end the cruel practice of locking children in detention camps. GetUp Campaigns Chief Erin McCallum said that the findings of the report were concerning. 'Whatever your political persuasion, locking up innocent kids in hideous detention camps is barbaric and it has to stop,' she said. Greens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said the report must be the turning point to end the cruel practice of locking children in detention camps. 'This vile, institutionalised child abuse has to end,' she said in a statement. 'No longer can we turn a blind eye to the sexual, physical and psychological abuse that these policies of indefinite detention are inflicting on children.' Immigration Minister Peter Dutton - who only took on the job in late December - said many of the recommendations reflected existing government policies and were superfluous. Activist group ChilOut said children must only be detained as a measure of last resort and only for the shortest appropriate period. 'Other recommendations would mean undermining the very policies that mean children don't get on boats in the first place,' he said in a statement. Numbers of children in immigration detention peaked at nearly 2000 in mid-2013 under Labor but now there are only 162 children still detained. Activist group ChilOut said children must only be detained as a measure of last resort and only for the shortest appropriate period. 'This report highlights our dramatic failure to uphold our obligations, by detaining children arbitrarily as punishment for seeking asylum,' it said in a statement. Opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles said Labor would work through the report findings and recommendations and respond appropriately. 'The best thing we can do for children in detention is to have refugee claims processed quickly so nobody has to languish in detention with no hope of settlement,' he said in a statement. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A report from the Australian Human Rights Commission found that many children in immigration detention centers have tried to hurt themselves or even committed self-harm.

The commission found that staying in these centers for a long time can cause mental and physical harm to children. The Australian government changed some laws about refugees, and the commission's president said this was very concerning. The report recommends that the government should end long detention for children, close an overcrowded immigration center, let children leave a small island named Nauru, and have someone look after kids who are alone. But the Attorney-General said that the government disagrees with the report's findings. The number of children in immigration detention centers was once almost 2,000, but now there are 162 children still held."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts.

Write an article based on this \\"A man claiming to be an estranged cousin of one of India's most popular politicians, J Jayalalitha, says he has conducted a second funeral for her.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Estranged Cousin Conducts Second Funeral for One of India's Most Popular Politicians, J Jayalalitha In a surprising turn of events, a man claiming to be an estranged cousin of one of India's most popular politicians, J Jayalalitha, has recently come forward to reveal that he has conducted a second funeral for the late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. This unexpected revelation has sparked significant discussion and curiosity in Indian political circles regarding the reasons and implications of such an act. J Jayalalitha, fondly referred to as 'Amma' by her followers, was a towering political figure in India, having served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for six non-consecutive terms. Born on February 24, 1948, Jayalalitha began her career as a film actress in the South Indian cinema before entering politics. She was a crucial member and leader of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) party until her death on December 5, 2016, following a prolonged illness. Her demise left a significant power vacuum in Tamil Nadu politics, and her loyal supporters still mourn her passing to this day. According to the man, who prefers to remain anonymous, he conducted the second funeral for Jayalalitha due to deep-rooted cultural beliefs and a sense of familial duty. He claims that though he was estranged from Jayalalitha, his familial connection to her necessitated the performance of certain religious rites and rituals for the late leader's soul to attain peace. Due to the high-profile nature of Jayalalitha, her first funeral had been scrutinized by the media and the public, focusing on the dignitaries who attended the ceremony and the elaborate arrangements for her send-off. It included a grand procession and burial at Chennai's Marina Beach alongside the resting places of other Tamil Nadu political legends like M. G. Ramachandran and C.N. Annadurai. In contrast, the second funeral organized by the estranged cousin was a small, private affair, held discreetly in his ancestral village. The rituals followed the traditions of their ancestral community, and only a select group of family members and close friends were in attendance. The estranged cousin's decision to conduct the second funeral indicates complex layers of cultural beliefs, familial commitments, and societal expectations that often dictate the lives of individuals in India. Despite his estrangement from Jayalalitha, the fact that he felt compelled to carry out the funeral rites demonstrates the powerful influence and importance placed on family and cultural traditions in the Indian social fabric. While this new development has raised several questions about the family dynamics and personal life of the iconic leader, it serves as an intriguing window into understanding the societal norms that continue to hold sway in India, even for those who achieve unparalleled heights of success and fame. This second funeral revelation has undoubtedly stirred up a great deal of interest in Jayalalitha's personal life and begs the question of whether there are more unexplored aspects of her life that might continue to surface posthumously. As the story unfolds, it remains to be seen how these ongoing revelations will influence the public's memory of the enigmatic and impactful J Jayalalitha."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary Jane \\"Mae\\" West (August 17, 1893 - November 22, 1980) was an American actress, singer, playwright, screenwriter, comedian, and sex symbol whose entertainment career spanned seven decades. Known for her lighthearted bawdy double entendres, and breezy sexual independence, West made a name for herself in vaudeville and on the stage in New York City before moving to Hollywood to become a comedian, actress, and writer in the motion picture industry, as well as appearing on radio and television. For her contributions to American cinema, the American Film Institute named West 15th among the greatest female stars of classic American cinema. One of the more controversial movie stars of her day, West encountered many problems, especially censorship. Mae West was a shrewd investor, produced her own stage acts, and invested her money in large tracts of land in Van Nuys, a thriving suburb of Los Angeles. With her considerable fortune, she could afford to do as she liked. In 1976, she appeared on Back Lot U.S.A. on CBS, where she was interviewed by Dick Cavett and sang \\"Frankie and Johnny\\" along with \\"After You've Gone.\\" That same year, she began work on her final film, Sextette (1978). Adapted from a 1959 script written by West, the film's daily revisions and production disagreements hampered production from the beginning. Due to the near-endless last-minute script changes and tiring production schedule, West agreed to have her lines signaled to her through a speaker concealed in her hair piece. Despite the daily problems, West was, according to Sextette director Ken Hughes, determined to see the film through. At 84, her now-failing eyesight made navigating around the set difficult, but she made it through the filming, a tribute to her self-confidence, remarkable endurance, and stature as a self-created star 67 years after her Broadway debut in 1911 at the age of 18. Time wrote an article on the indomitable star entitled \\"At 84, Mae West Is Still Mae West\\". Upon its release, Sextette was not a critical or commercial success, but remains notable for the diverse cast, and because none of West's contemporaries such as Dietrich, Garbo, etc., were still making films. The cast included some of West's first co-stars such George Raft (Night After Night, 1932), silver screen stars such as Walter Pigeon and Tony Curtis, and more contemporary pop stars such as The Beatles' Ringo Starr and Alice Cooper, and television favorites such as Dom DeLuise and gossip queen Rona Barrett. It also included cameos of some of her famed musclemen from her 1950s Las Vegas show, such as the still remarkably fit Reg Lewis. Sextette also reunited Mae West with Edith Head, her costume designer from 1933 in She Done Him Wrong. The film was a last hurrah and a Valentine from Mae West to her fans. In August 1980, West tripped while getting out of bed. After the fall, West was unable to speak and was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, where tests revealed that she had suffered a stroke. She died on November 22, 1980, at the age of 87. A private service was held in the Old North Church replica, in Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills, on November 25, 1980. Bishop Andre Penachio, a friend, officiated at the entombment in the family mausoleum at Cypress Hills Abbey, Brooklyn, purchased in 1930 when her mother died. Her father and brother were also entombed there before her, and her younger sister, Beverly, was laid to rest in the last of the five crypts less than 18 months after West's death. For her contribution to the film industry, Mae West has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street in Hollywood. For her contributions as a stage actor in the theater world, she has been inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. What was the last movie in which she appeared","completion":"The last movie in which Mae West appeared was \\"Sextette\\" (1978).

Pay attention to new traditions, talk to your family about which ones you want to make your own and stick with them.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario, where you decide to sit and guard your eggs more like a hawk, can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. To better understand this, let's break down the different aspects of the bird's reproductive process and their corresponding steps, as well as the possible implications of the perturbation in question. 1. A bird lays an egg - This step involves the female bird laying an egg after successful fertilization. The perturbation does not directly impact this step, as laying an egg is a natural biological process. 2. The egg hatches into a baby bird - Hatching is the natural process by which a baby bird emerges from its egg. The perturbation does not directly impact this step; however, it indirectly contributes to its success. By guarding the eggs more vigilantly, like a hawk, you would increase the chances of eggs hatching because they are better protected from predators and other potential threats. 3. Baby bird eats - The baby bird needs to consume food in order to obtain the necessary nutrients for growth and development. The perturbation does not directly impact this step, but indirectly, better-guarded eggs could lead to a higher survival rate of baby birds that will require sustenance. 4. Grows into an adult bird - The baby bird will grow into an adult bird as it feeds and matures. The perturbation does not directly affect this step, but it may contribute to an overall increase in the number of adult birds due to improved protection of eggs and higher chances of successful hatching. 5. The bird finds a mate - When the bird reaches maturity, it will seek out a mate for reproduction. The perturbation does not have a direct impact on this step, but an increase in the number of adult birds might lead to more potential mates being available. 6. The pair build a nest - This step involves the paired birds constructing a nest for future eggs. The perturbation does not directly impact this step, but it could indirectly impact the quality and success of nests by promoting more attentive parenting behavior. 7. The birds lay eggs - The process begins anew with the female bird laying eggs. The perturbation does not directly affect this step. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of guarding the eggs more hawk-like is considered to be indirectly impacting a step of the process. While it does not directly influence the natural biological processes that comprise the life cycle of a bird, increased egg protection can lead to higher success rates in hatching, which may subsequently result in larger populations of adult birds. This, in turn, could potentially affect some of the later steps in the process, such as finding a mate and building a nest, through higher numbers of surviving birds and improved parenting behaviors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The article in the A). article was about trains.; B). newspaper was about trains.;","completion":"The sentence should end as follows: \\"Chris was reading an article from the newspaper. The article in the newspaper was about trains.\\" Choosing option B provides a complete thought, maintaining the grammatical and coherent structure of the sentence. Let's break down the sentence to understand it better: The first part, \\"Chris was reading an article from the newspaper,\\" introduces the activity Chris is doing. It sets up the context by letting us know what Chris is reading (an article) and where the article is (in the newspaper). The second part is designed to give more details about the article that Chris is reading. Beginning with the phrase \\"The article in the…\\" creates an expectation that more information will be provided about the article mentioned in the first part. The second part, therefore, needs to tell us something additional about this article. Option A, \\"article was about trains,\\" feels somewhat incomplete because the contextual link to the newspaper presented in the first part of the sentence is missing. It is evident that the article Chris is reading is the one being further described, but specifying that the article is in the newspaper reinforces this link and makes the sentence feel more complete and coherent. Option B, \\"newspaper was about trains,\\" maintains this link. \\"The article in the newspaper\\" points clearly back to \\"an article from the newspaper\\" used earlier, thus satisfying the expectation set up by the first part of the sentence. Then, \\"was about trains\\" provides the necessary additional detail about the article: the topic it covers, i.e., trains. So, B is just a more coherent, grammatically correct, and satisfying way of finishing the sentence that started with \\"Chris was reading an article from the newspaper.\\" By picking option B, we provide all the necessary information in a way that flows smoothly and logically."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now let's try to understand the passage in simpler words: There is a secret report from NATO (a group of countries that help and protect each other), which says that Pakistan is still helping the Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. Remember, the Taliban is a group of people who have caused a lot of trouble in Afghanistan. Pakistan has said many times that they are not helping the Taliban, but this report says they are. A man called Jerome Starkey, who works for a newspaper in London, read the report and told everyone what it said. The report says that a very powerful group in Pakistan called the Inter Services Intelligence knows where all the important Taliban fighters are hiding. Pakistan says that this report is not true and they are not helping the Taliban. They say that they want peace in Afghanistan just like everyone else. A man from Pakistan's government, named Abdul Basit, said that they are not interfering or causing trouble in Afghanistan. He added that Pakistan has also faced many problems because of the fighting in Afghanistan. They want a peaceful and stable Afghanistan because it is good for their own country too. The story also talks about a report made by American intelligence agencies that says the Taliban fighters have faced some difficulties in some areas of Afghanistan because there are many soldiers from different countries helping the people there.

Write an article based on this summary: Sixteen Turkish construction workers have been freed a month after they were kidnapped in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, Turkish PM Ahmet Davutoglu has said.","completion":"Title: Turkish Construction Workers Freed After a Month-Long Ordeal in Kidnapping Incident in Baghdad Introduction Sixteen Turkish construction workers have been released following a month-long kidnapping ordeal in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. The news of their safe release was announced by Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. This incident has put a spotlight on the challenges faced by foreign workers in Iraq, while also underlining the ongoing security threats in the country. Background of the Kidnapping Incident The group of sixteen construction workers were kidnapped on September 2, 2016, while working on a project in Sadr City, a predominantly Shiite neighborhood in Baghdad. The project, a sports complex and stadium, was being executed by a Turkish construction company contracted by the Iraqi government. The details of their kidnapping and the identity of the captors initially remained unknown. Following their abduction, the group was held hostage for over a month, during which time scarce information about their well-being and location was available. The captors released a video through a militant Shiite website showing the workers pleading for their release. In the video, the captors made several demands, including the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Iraqi soil, cessation of oil exports from the Kurdistan Regional Government, and the lifting of a curfew in a predominantly Shiite Turkish town. As negotiations took place, the situation raised concerns and diplomatic tensions between Turkey and Iraq. Efforts to Secure Their Release Immediately after the news of the kidnapping broke, the Turkish government launched efforts to secure the workers' safe release. Turkish and Iraqi intelligence agencies joined forces to gather information on the workers' whereabouts and the identity of the captors, while Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and other officials engaged in behind-the-scenes talks with Iraqi leaders and various groups. During the weeks following the abduction, the captors released a series of videos showing the kidnapped workers and issuing demands. The Turkish government remained committed to ensuring the workers' safety while assessing avenues to meet the captors' demands without violating its own national interests. Safe Release and Aftermath After almost a month of tension, negotiations, and efforts to locate the kidnapped workers, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu announced the release of the sixteen Turkish construction workers on October 3, 2016. The workers were handed over to Turkish officials at the Turkish embassy in Baghdad and were reported to be in good health. The release of the hostages came as a relief to their families, who had anxiously awaited news of their loved ones. The successful outcome also highlighted the growing cooperation and diplomatic relations between Turkey and Iraq in dealing with security issues. Challenges Faced by Foreign Workers in Iraq The kidnapping and eventual release of the Turkish construction workers shed light on the challenges and security risks faced by foreign workers in Iraq. These individuals, often employed in the construction, oil, and service industries, are exposed to significant risks due to the instability and insecurity in the country. The incident serves as a reminder for the international community and foreign workers alike of the need for heightened security measures and preparedness for potential risks while operating in volatile regions such as Iraq. Conclusion The release of the sixteen Turkish construction workers brought an end to a month-long kidnapping ordeal that put the challenges faced by foreign workers in Iraq under the spotlight. It underlined the importance of diplomatic relations, security measures, and cooperation in navigating such complex crises. As Iraq continues to grapple with security challenges amidst ongoing regional tensions, the safe return of these workers serves as a reminder of the need for vigilance and coordination when dealing with incidents involving foreign nationals. Increased awareness of the risks faced by workers in volatile regions, as well as improved cooperation between countries and organizations, will hopefully help to minimize the occurrence of these types of incidents in the future."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task you will be given a list of integers.

You know how sometimes, you need a friend to help you solve a difficult puzzle? Well, that's kind of like what the police are doing here! One day, the police found a body in a forest in a place called Conwy county. The forest is like a big, natural playground with lots of trees, plants, and animals. Sometimes, people go there to have fun and play, but sadly, this time, they found someone who had passed away. Now, when the police find a body, they need to figure out who the person is. It's important because they need to tell the person's family what happened. It's a bit like solving a mystery! But, the police couldn't figure out who this person was, so they decided to ask some friends for help. They thought, \\"Who would know more about this person, based on the clues that we have?\\" And then they came up with a great idea: Let's ask dentists for help! Dentists, as you know, are like superheroes for our teeth. They make sure that our teeth are clean and strong so we can eat our favorite foods. They can also learn a lot about a person by looking at their teeth, like how old they are or if they had any dental work done. So, the police asked dentists in Conwy county to help them figure out who this person was by looking at his or her teeth. They hoped that one of the dentists might recognize the dental work and be able to tell them more about the person. This story teaches us that sometimes, we all need a little help from friends, even if we are the police, and that dentists are not only good at taking care of our teeth but also at helping solve mysteries!

Write a summary based on this article: Locked in a close race, Mitt Romney is predicting victory in Michigan's critical primary. He's hoping to prevent an unexpected loss to rival Rick Santorum in the state where the former Massachusetts governor was born and raised. Romney has spent the past five days campaigning hard for votes in Michigan's primary on Tuesday, selling himself as a native son steeped in the auto industry that has defined the state for decades. He has a strong lead in Arizona, which also votes Tuesday. Romney has had to play catch-up in Michigan after losses to Santorum on Feb. 8 in Minnesota, Missouri and Colorado. A loss in Michigan would seriously damage the campaign of the on-again, off-again front-runner and probably stretch an already lengthy GOP nominating contest even more. ||||| These forecasts are formulated from an average of recent surveys, with adjustments made to account for a polling firm's accuracy, freshness of a poll and each candidate's momentum. Although this improves accuracy, there is still considerable uncertainty in the forecast as is reflected in the range of possible vote totals for each candidate. Read more about the methodology. ||||| Mitt Romney is headed for an overwhelming victory in Arizona's primary on Tuesday. He's at 43% to 26% for Rick Santorum, 18% for Newt Gingrich, and 11% for Ron Paul. You can make a fair argument that Romney's already won the Arizona primary. Almost half of those planning to vote have already cast their ballots, and Romney has a 48-25 advantage over Santorum with those folks. That lead makes it nearly impossible for Santorum to make up the difference on election day, and Romney has a 39-27 advantage with those planning to vote on Tuesday anyway. Romney's winning basically winning every voter group in Arizona, even those he's tended to do quite poorly with. He leads Santorum 39-33 with Evangelicals, 39-23 with Tea Party voters (Santorum's in 3rd, Gingrich is actually 2nd at 30%), and 37-29 with those describing themselves as 'very conservative.' We project the Mormon vote at 14%. Romney leads 77-9 with them, but he has a 38-29 advantage with non-Mormons as well. Seniors are a key base of support for him in Arizona as they are everywhere. He leads 53-22 with them. Santorum's image has taken a big hit over the last week in the state. His net favorability has dropped 15 points from +34 (61/27) to just +19 (54/35). The debate Wednesday night may have damaged his cause. 51% of likely voters report having watched it and he's actually in 3rd place with those folks at 21%, behind Romney's 43% and Gingrich's 23%. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Mitt Romney is poised for victory in Michigan's crucial primary, aiming to prevent an unexpected loss to rival Rick Santorum, despite playing catch-up after losses in Minnesota, Missouri, and Colorado.

Rescue crews flown in by helicopter to reach the crash site in rugged terrain reported finding two debris field on fire, suggesting that the plane broke apart on impact, the Pinal County sheriff's office said. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer says the Rockwell AC69 had just departed from Mesa's Falcon Field when it crashed about 40 miles east of downtown Phoenix. Authorities started getting calls reporting an explosion near the peak of a mountain at about 6:30 p.m. It was unclear how many passengers were aboard the plane, which was registered to Ponderosa Aviation Inc. in Safford, Ariz. A man who answered the phone Wednesday night at Ponderosa Aviation declined to comment on the crash and refused to identify himself. Calls to Falcon Field, which mostly serves small, private planes, weren't immediately returned. Kenitzer said the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board would be investigating the cause of the crash. Rescue crews who arrived by helicopter reported finding 24-inch tires at the crash site, which would indicate a small twin-engine plane. Pinal County sheriff's spokeswoman Angelique Graham said people who heard an explosion near the Flat Iron area close to Lost Dutchman State Park. \\"People said it sounded like fireworks going off,\\" Graham said. Some witnesses told Phoenix-area television stations they heard a plane trying to rev its engines to climb higher before apparently hitting the mountains. The elevation is about 5,000 feet at the Superstition Mountains' highest point. Video showed several fires burning on the mountainside, where heavy brush is common. The region near Lost Dutchman State Park and the Superstition Wilderness is filled with steep canyons, soaring rocky outcroppings and cactus. Treasure hunters who frequent the area have been looking for the legendary Lost Dutchman mine for more than a century. ||||| (CNN) -- Six people, including three children, were killed when their plane crashed into rugged mountains east of Phoenix on a Thanksgiving eve trip, authorities said Thursday. Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu identified the dead as a father and his three children, plus two other men. All were Arizona residents and knew each other well, he said. The twin-engine Rockwell 690A airplane slammed into a steep cliff near the top of the Superstition Mountains at 6:31 p.m. on Wednesday, strewing debris for hundreds of yards down the 80-degree incline, Babeu told reporters. Recovery efforts by more than 50 deputies and volunteers involved collect and preserving the remains, the sheriff said. \\"No one could survive that crash,\\" he said. The plane had flown from Safford to Mesa, where it picked up the siblings -- ages 9, 8 and 6 -- for the Thanksgiving holiday, Babeu said. \\"All of these families are just obviously heartbroken, traumatized over the loss of their loved ones so suddenly here on Thanksgiving,\\" he said. Federal officials were expected to begin their investigation as soon as Thursday, according to Babeu. A man who said he witnessed the impact told CNN that a mushroom cloud of flames lit up the evening sky. Kevin Cunningham, 44, of Apache Junction, said he was talking on the phone from his back porch and saw the crash a few miles away. \\"The flames lit up the mountain,\\" said Cunningham, adding the plane appeared to be flying level before the crash. \\"I didn't see where it was in distress.\\" CNN's Phil Gast and Tom Cohen contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"A small twin-engine Rockwell AC69 plane crashed into the Superstition Mountains east of Phoenix on Wednesday night, with no apparent sign of survivors.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The ancient Greek city of Bargylia, 30 kilometres from Bodrum, Turkey, has come up for sale, according to Turkish newspaper Hürriyet. The site’s theatre, acropolis, fortification walls, and necropolis make up an archaeological site, which dates back to the first century B.C. The city was founded in honor of Bargylos, who was killed when he was kicked by the winged horse Pegasus. The ancient city is about 81.5 acres and has been private property since 1927. According to Hurryiet, a local told the paper, “We hear the sounds of treasure hunters at night, but we cannot do anything out of fear.” A long-abandoned monastery in Bargylia now serves as an animal shelter and cows graze among the ruins. As it is a Grade 1 archaeological site, no construction is permitted on property. But a new owner may seek to downgrade that status and build a resort on the ruins. Archaeologists are hoping that Greece’s Culture and Tourism Ministry will step in and buy the site to protect the artifacts buried there. A proper archaeological dig has never been performed at Bargylia so it is unknown what treasures lie underneath the earth’s surface — but there’s likely something big. The site was up for sale in 2015 but nobody bought it. This time around, the price has been lowered by about 2 million. ||||| The ancient Greek city of Bargylia, a once-prosperous community dating back some 2,500 years, is seeking a new protector. Under private ownership since the early 20th century, the 300-acre site, perched on a steep hill overlooking the Gulf of Güllük, includes the remnants of a temple, theater, a large defensive wall and an ancient gymnasium. And it can all be yours for the relative bargain price of about 8 million. The site is hitting the market to protect its buried secrets from treasure hunters and to help preserve the remaining ruins. \\"We hear the sounds of treasure hunters at night, but we cannot do anything out of fear,\\" one local told the Hurriyet Daily News in Turkey. Rumors and legends The site, littered with the remains of marble columns and other hints of the city's past, offers beautiful views of the Gulf of Güllük. (Photo: Troels Myrup/flickr) According to legend, the city was founded by a hero of Greek mythology named Bellerophon. He named it after his companion Bargylos, who had been killed by a kick from the winged horse Pegasus. What little history we know of Bargylia indicates that it likely derived much of its wealth from fisheries and nearby salt-pans in the shallowest parts of the gulf. Because the site has remained in private hands, archaeologists have never conducted a proper excavation. Rumors abound that many of the city's most spectacular ruins still lay uncovered, including the possible remains of a mythological statue with special powers. \\"There was at Bargylia a statue of Artemis Cindyas under the bare sky, probably in a temple, about which statue the incredible story was told, that neither rain nor snow ever fell on it,\\" shared one report. Today, the only occupants of Bargylia are cattle, who graze among the ruins and take shelter in a long-abandoned monastery. While no construction is currently permitted due to classification as a Grade 1 archaeological site, a new owner could downgrade that designation and build whatever they wish. Locals, concerned that a resort could one day spoil the wild beauty of Bargylia, are hopeful that Greece’s Culture and Tourism Ministry will step in and purchase the property. You can view an extensive first-person tour of the ruins in the video below. ||||| An ancient city in Turkey is for sale with a price tag of a cool 35m lira (8.3m/£6.1m). The 2500-year-old city of Bargylia is located 30 km away from the Aegean resort of Bodrum, and the sale is designed to protect its archaeological sites from treasure hunters and decay. According to mythology, the city was founded by hero of Greek mythology, Bellerophon, in honour of his friend Bargylos, who was killed by a kick from his winged horse Pegasus. Turkey’s Hurriyet newspaper reports that the 330-acre site has been private property since 1927. One of its owners, Huseyin Ucpinar, has urged the government to step in to protect the city, whose theatre, acropolis, fortification walls and necropolis are listed locally as a Grade 1 archaeological site. Despite this, treasure hunters have already caused damage with illegal excavations, and cattle graze around, and take shelter in, a long-abandoned monastery. Turkish archaeologists have called on the country’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism to expropriate numerous archaeological sites, such as the one in Bargylia, to ensure their protection. Many of Bargylia’s ancient structures are under ruins and located underground, and the report says no government-backed preservation work can take place at Bargylia because it’s on private land. The owners believe therefore that the city might be a good addition to the Turkish culture ministry’s land portfolio. There was a previous failed attempt to sell the site in 2015. It was described as “a first degree archaeological site, facing the Bird Heaven Lake near the Bogazici Village, with full sea and lake view,” but no buyer was found. This time around, the asking price has been reduced by almost 2m (£1.5m). |||||Summary:","completion":"A very old city called Bargylia in Turkey is being sold for a lot of money.

Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party. Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal. Umbopo explains that Gagoola had attempted to sacrifice Jesse in order to keep her power as the Kukuanas' ruler because...

Their financial future is set, their career in crime a thing of the past. However, Stanley Lloyd (Woody Harrelson), the FBI agent who has spent seven years doggedly pursuing Burdett, only to be foiled time after time, refuses to believe their retreat into domesticity. After a few months, Lloyd shows up, accusing Burdett of hiding out in the same place where a cruise ship is displaying another large rare diamond, the third of a set of diamonds that he stole. He thinks the two are planning to lift the third Napoleon diamond, one of the three largest non-flawed diamonds in the world.When the two adversaries meet up in paradise, Burdett unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle. Despite his pleas of innocence and placing Lloyd in first-class accommodations to show how he doesn't need to steal anything, Burdett's curiosity gets the better of him and he starts casing the ship. However, not only does Lola suspect that he's ready for one more job, so does the local thug, Henri Mooré (Don Cheadle), who threatens Burdett to steal the diamond for him.Burdett pretends to work with Mooré, even giving him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he earlier related to Stan). Stan teams up with local police officer Sophie (Naomie Harris) to catch Burdett, and tails him to Junkanoo, a local parade, where Max loses him, warning that he shouldn't tail so closely. Stan and Sophie then have sex, and Lola kicks Max out after realizing his activities. Max is forced to bunk with Stan, and they share their thoughts about each other's lives.

There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

Article: Just as some people think that certain numbers are lucky or unlucky, others believe that we can use numbers to understand our personalities, or predict what will happen to us in the future. Numerology is a way of using numbers to describe a person's character, and to make predictions about future life events. Numerologists use the numbers 1-9, 11 and 22 -- also known as the \\"master\\" numbers -- to help a person understand his or her personality, life goals, and destiny. Numerologists consider yourLife Path number to be the most significant because this number describes your character. To find this number, add together all the numbers in your date of birth. For example, a person born on April 25, 1985 would add the month (4), to the numbers of the date (2+5), plus the numbers of the birth year (1+9+8+5). In this case the total is 34, so this person's life path number is 7(3+4). Numerologists believe that people with this number are peaceful and affectionate but can also be very reserved. Your Expression numberdescribes your talents and predicts how you should use these to fulfill your destiny in life. Numerologists assign a number between 1 and 9 to each of the letters in your name. These numbers are then added together in the same way as before to find your Expression number. Numerologists can also do calculations to predict when the most challenging periods of your life will be. Numerologists also believe that the day a person is born is important. Each day of the month has a character description. People born on the fourth are said to be responsible, honest, and stubborn. People born on the fifteenth have very strong attachments to family and home. Those who celebrate their birthday on the thirtieth are artistic, creative, and imaginative, and often make good writers. If we calculate the numerical value of our name and birth date, numerologists believe that we can learn more about our personalities. They also believe that we can predict our destinies, how our lives will progress, and what challenges we may... Question: According to the passage, numerologists believe that _ . - Life Path number can be used to predict a person's most challenging life periods - Expression number is the most meaningful for people to learn a person's character - numbers can help people better understand themselves - numbers can be used to change a person's future Answer:","completion":"According to the passage, numerologists believe that numbers can help people better understand themselves. The text mentions two specific ways numerologists use numbers for this purpose: through the Life Path number and the Expression number. The Life Path number, derived from the digits of a person's birth date, is used to describe a person's character. The Expression number, derived from the numerical equivalents of the letters in a person's name, describes a person's talents and predicts how they should use them to fulfill their destiny.

Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. But I can use this background: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and other small alkanes are listed in the Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally boil and melt at higher temperatures. and the situation: Two sisters Mary and Beth were into sciences. Beth studied physics, while Mary studied chemistry and especially alkanes. They were very devoted to studying. Answer the following question: Which sister studied more about ethane? The answer is:","completion":"Mary, because she studied chemistry and focused specifically on alkanes. The study of alkanes, including ethane, falls under the realm of chemistry rather than physics. As mentioned in the background information, the saturated hydrocarbons called alkanes have unique properties and characteristics. Methane, ethane, and other small alkanes are examples of these substances, and their boiling and melting points are determined by the number of carbon atoms they contain. Since Beth studied physics, her academic focus would have been more on the fundamental principles, concepts, and phenomena related to matter, energy, and their interactions. While physics does cover some aspects of matter and energy at the atomic and molecular level, it would not typically delve into the specific study of chemical compounds and their properties, like alkanes. On the other hand, Mary's specialization in chemistry allowed her to study various aspects of matter, including its composition, structure, and properties. This field also focuses on the changes that matter undergoes during chemical reactions. As a chemist, Mary would have learned about how atoms combine to form molecules and the resulting properties of these compounds. In her particular interest in alkanes, Mary would have gained in-depth knowledge about saturated hydrocarbons like ethane, making her the sister who studied more about ethane."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article with the title: \\"Do Critics Make Good Novelists?\\" Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Do Critics Make Good Novelists?\\" Hello, little friends! Today, we will be talking about people who review books, called \\"critics\\", and if they can write their own books too! That sounds fun, right? First, let's find out who a \\"critic\\" is. A critic is someone who reads a story, like the ones you enjoy at bedtime, and tells others what they think about it. They say if the story is good or not, if it has exciting moments, or if the characters are funny or brave. This way, they help people decide if they want to read that story too! Now, let's learn about \\"novelists.\\" Novelists are the people who write those stories you hear or read. They come up with all the fantastic adventures you love so much, and they think about the new friends you'll meet in their books, like the brave heroes, funny animals, or even scary monsters! So the big question we have is: can a critic be a novelist? Can someone who talks about other people's stories and characters write their own exciting book too? The answer is: yes, they can! In fact, some critics have become fantastic novelists! You see, when we do one thing often, it makes us better at it. It's like practicing your favorite sport or learning to ride a bike! Critics read lots and lots of stories, so they learn what makes people happy, sad, or excited when reading a book. They understand how a good story should be written and how to make the events and characters interesting. And because of that, they might decide to write their own story. But, it's also important to remember that not all critics will be good novelists, and that's okay! Just like how not all of us can be good at every sport or activity, critics may be better at reading and talking about books than writing their own. That doesn't mean they can't give it a try, though! So, little ones, now you know that critics can make good novelists! They have practiced a lot by reading many stories, and that helps them understand what makes a story fun or exciting. It's their love for stories that can lead them to create their own fantastic adventures for you to enjoy! And remember, always keep reading and exploring new books!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The moon rover, known as Yutu in Mandarin Chinese, and the Chang'e-3 lander were restarted by the Beijing Aerospace Control Center (BACC), China's Xinhua news agency said. It had been set to sleep for two weeks to ride out extreme climatic conditions and will finally undertake its scientific mission. The Jade Rabbit was \\" put to sleep\\" on 26 December at the onset of the first lunar night of the mission. One night on the moon lasts for around two weeks on Earth and during this time, temperatures fall to -180degC ---conditions too cold for the equipment to function in. There is also no sunlight to power the Jade Rabbit's solar panels. Zhou Jianliang, chief engineer with the BACC, explained: \\" During the lunar night, the lander and the rover were in a power-off condition and the communication with Earth was cut off. \\" When the night ends, they will be started up with the power provided by sunlight and resume operation and communication according to preset programmes. He added that the Jade Rabbit surviving the lunar night showed Chinese technology had proved successful. The Jade Rabbit and the lander compose Chang'e-3 landed on the moon on 14 December.

Please answer the following question: This article: Aaliyah Dana Haughton (; January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001) was an American singer, actress, and model. Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Detroit, Michigan, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show Star Search and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R. Kelly, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing but a Number. The album sold 3 million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records. Aaliyah worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott for her second album, One in a Million, which sold 3 million copies in the United States and more than 8 million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, Romeo Must Die. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single \\"Try Again\\". The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 solely on airplay, making Aaliyah the first artist in Billboard history to achieve this goal. \\"Try Again\\" also earned Aaliyah a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocalist. After completing Romeo Must Die, Aaliyah filmed her role in Queen of the Damned, and released her self-titled third and final studio album in 2001. On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah and eight others were killed in a plane crash in the Bahamas after filming the music video for the single \\"Rock the Boat\\". The pilot, Luis Morales III, was unlicensed at the time of the accident and toxicology tests revealed that he had traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system.

Question: What was Hancock's title? Movie plot title: 1776 Movie plot: While General George Washington is conducting the struggle against the British Empire on the battlefield, the Continental Congress in Philadelphia piddles away its time over trivial matters and continually refuses to begin debating the question of American independence. The leader of the independence faction is the abrasive John Adams of Massachusetts, whose continuous pushing of the issue has brought their cause to a complete standstill. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania leads the opposition that hopes for reconciliation with England. During his quieter moments, Adams calls up the image of his wife Abigail Adams, who resides in Massachusetts and gives him insight and encouragement (these conversations are based on letters between the couple). Dr. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania suggests another colony that supports independence should submit a proposal. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia voluntarily rides off to Williamsburg, Virginia to get authorization from the Virginia Colony to propose independence. Dr. Lyman Hall arrives to represent Georgia, and immediately, he is interrogated by his fellow delegates regarding his views on independence (with Dickinson framing it as \\"treason\\"). Weeks later, Lee returns with the resolution, and debate on the question begins. However, in the midst of debate, Caesar Rodney falters because of his cancer and is taken back to Delaware by fellow delegate Thomas McKean, leaving the anti-independence George Read to represent Delaware. After heated discussions, the question is called without a majority of positive votes present. The New Jersey delegation, led by Reverend John Witherspoon, arrives just in time to provide a vote supporting independence. In a move intended to defeat the resolution, Dickinson calls for a vote requiring unanimity for passage. The vote ends in a tie between the colonies, New York abstaining as it does in every vote. It is ultimately decided in favor of unanimity by John Hancock, president of the Continental Congress, who argues that any objecting colony...

She was born Marem-Ides Leventon (Russian name Adelaida Yakovlevna Leventon) in Yalta, Crimea, Russian Empire. Her stage name Alla Nazimova was a combination of Alla (a diminutive of Adelaida) and the surname of Nadezhda Nazimova, the heroine of the Russian novel Children of the Streets. She was widely known as just Nazimova, and also went under the name Alia Nasimoff. She was the youngest of three children of Jewish parents Yakov Abramovich Leventon, a pharmacist, and Sofia (Sara) Lvovna Horowitz, who moved to Yalta in 1870 from Kishinev. From 1917 to 1922, Nazimova wielded considerable influence and power in Hollywood. Nazimova helped start the careers of both of Rudolph Valentino's wives, Jean Acker and Natacha Rambova. Although she was involved in an affair with Acker, it is debated as to whether her connection with Rambova ever developed into a sexual affair. Nevertheless, there were rumors that Nazimova and Rambova were involved in a lesbian affair (they are discussed at length in Dark Lover, Emily Leider's biography of Rudolph Valentino) but those rumors have never been definitely confirmed. She was very impressed by Rambova's skills as an art director, and Rambova designed the innovative sets for Nazimova's film productions of Camille and Salome. Of those Nazimova is confirmed to have been involved with romantically, the list includes actress Eva Le Gallienne, director Dorothy Arzner, writer Mercedes de Acosta, and Oscar Wilde's niece, Dolly Wilde. Bridget Bate Tichenor, a Magic Realist artist and Surrealist painter, was also rumored to be one of Nazimova's favored lovers in Hollywood during the World War II years of 1940 to 1942. The two had been introduced by the poet and art collector Edward James, and according to Tichenor, their intimate relationship angered Nazimova's longtime companion, Glesca Marshall. However, the fact that Tichenor was pregnant most of 1940, giving birth to her son on Dec. 21, 1940, along with the 40-year age gap between the two women, casts some doubt on this rumor. It is believed that Nazimova coined the phrase \\"sewing circle\\" as code to refer to lesbian or bisexual actresses of her day who concealed their true sexuality. Nazimova lived with Glesca Marshall from 1929 until her death in 1945. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Was this strictly a romantic affair?","completion":"From the text, it is stated that \\"Although she was involved in an affair with Acker, it is debated as to whether her connection with Rambova ever developed into a sexual affair.\\" This quote shows that it is uncertain whether the relationship was strictly romantic because the nature of the connection between Nazimova and Rambova is debated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Complete the following sentence. The man in detox had to choose between puking on the floor or in the toilet. Luckily, he did it in [a]. toilet . [b]. floor .","completion":"The man in detox had to choose between puking on the floor or in the toilet. Luckily, he did it in the toilet. In this situation, opting to vomit in the toilet was undoubtedly the more responsible and sanitary choice. Detoxification can be an incredibly challenging and uncomfortable process, as the individual's body works to rid itself of harmful substances. Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms experienced during this period, and finding an appropriate place to release these unpleasant side effects is crucial in maintaining a clean and safe environment. By choosing to vomit in the toilet, the man demonstrated a level of self-awareness and consideration for his surroundings, even amidst the turmoil of the detox process. This decision greatly reduced the risk of creating a mess that could potentially lead to further health hazards or require extensive clean-up efforts. It also minimized the potential embarrassment associated with such an episode, as vomiting on the floor can attract unwanted attention and reinforce negative perceptions about those undergoing detox. Moreover, using the toilet for its intended purpose allowed the man to maintain a certain level of dignity during a particularly vulnerable time. By keeping his bodily fluids contained within the confines of the porcelain bowl, he preemptively prevented the spread of bacteria and germs that could contribute to a more unsanitary living environment for himself and others. In contrast, had the man opted to vomit on the floor, not only would he have made a difficult situation worse for himself, but he would have also inconvenienced those around him. Cleaning up the mess would require extra work on the part of the facility's maintenance staff, who already have a tough job maintaining a clean environment during periods of high patient turnover and busy schedules. Additionally, the presence of vomit on the floor could have caused discomfort for other patients, potentially triggering further episodes or contributing to an overall decline in morale. In conclusion, the man's decision to vomit in the toilet was the most responsible and considerate choice under the circumstances. It demonstrated a commitment to preserving a clean and safe environment, eased the burden on facility staff, and ensured a more comfortable living space for both himself and others going through the detox process. Although vomiting is an unpleasant experience for anyone, the man's choice in this scenario reflects a small, yet significant, victory in the pursuit of recovery and personal growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach. Question: Where did they get Tiger?

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: What does Jacob teach Cal? pick up women The answer is:","completion":"Step 1: Establish the settings and characters In order to build a movie plot, we need to first establish the main characters, their backgrounds, and the setting in which the story is taking place. - Main Characters: Jacob (a smooth-talking, experienced womanizer) and Cal (a shy, inexperienced man when it comes to dating). - Setting: A modern urban city, a popular nightclub, and various other venues where people socialize. Step 2: Introduce conflict or problem The story begins with Cal going through a tough breakup with his long-time girlfriend. In the process, he discovers that he's never really learned how to \\"pick up women\\" or navigate the dating world. This is the main driving force behind the story, and Cal's problem that needs to be resolved. Step 3: Introduce mentor figure One night, at a popular nightclub, Cal observes Jacob successfully wooing a beautiful woman. Impressed and intrigued, Cal decides to approach Jacob and asks him for help in learning his techniques. Jacob agrees, and thus begins their mentor-student relationship. Step 4: Formulate the lessons and challenges Throughout the story, Jacob teaches Cal various techniques and strategies for picking up women, which include: - Building self-confidence - Improving appearance and style - Mastering effective communication and flirting skills - Delivering compliments and making meaningful connections Each lesson is accompanied by various challenges and awkward situations, where Cal struggles to put these new techniques into practice but gradually improves as he gains more experience. Step 5: Introduce secondary characters and subplots As the story unfolds, we also meet secondary characters who contribute to the storyline. These characters might include: - Female love interests who Cal pursues - Cal's ex-girlfriend, who eventually tries to win him back - Friends and doubters who discourage Cal's new pursuits - Some of Jacob's past relationships or \\"conquests\\" Step 6: Reach a turning point As Cal starts to become more successful in picking up women, he begins to question whether there's more to relationships than simply picking up women. He starts to feel unsatisfied and empty after short flings, and begins to wonder what it means to find a meaningful connection. This may be sparked by a particular encounter, like meeting a woman who challenges his newfound ways or shows him the importance of meaningful relationships. Step 7: Climax and resolution At the climax of the story, Cal has to make a choice. He may be confronted with the decision of whether to pursue a meaningful relationship with a particular woman or maintain his new lifestyle as a womanizer with Jacob. Ultimately, Cal decides to use what he has learned to establish a meaningful and long-lasting relationship, realizing that there's more to life than superficial connections. This represents Cal's character growth and the resolution of his initial problem. Step 8: Ending The movie ends with Cal being happy and content in a meaningful relationship, having learned valuable lessons from Jacob. At the same time, Jacob starts to question his own lifestyle choices and may even begin to seek a more meaningful connection as well. This leaves the possibility for further character development and potential sequels. Thus, the movie plot revolves around Cal's journey in learning how to pick up women, his personal growth, and realization of the importance of meaningful relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Waterboys are a Scottish/Irish folk rock band formed in Edinburgh in 1983 by Scottish musician Mike Scott. The band's membership, past and present, has been composed mainly of musicians from Scotland and Ireland with Edinburgh, Dublin, Spiddal, New York and Findhorn, serving as homes for the group. Mike Scott has remained as the only constant member throughout the band's career. They have explored a number of different styles, but their music is mainly a mix of Celtic folk music with rock and roll. After the release of their debut The Waterboys began touring. Their first show was at the Batschkapp Club in Frankfurt in February 1984. The band then consisted of Mike Scott on vocals and guitar, Anthony Thistlethwaite on saxophone and mandolin, Wallinger on keyboards, Roddy Lorimer on trumpets, Martyn Swain on bass and Kevin Wilkinson on drums. John Caldwell from Another Pretty Face also played guitar, and Scottish singer Eddi Reader sang backing vocals for the band's first two concerts. The band made some new recordings and over-dubbed old material in late 1983 and early 1984 which were released as The Waterboys' second album, A Pagan Place, in June 1984. The \\"official\\" Waterboys line-up at this time, according to the sleeve of A Pagan Place, was Scott, Thistlethwaite, Wallinger and Wilkinson, with guest contributions from Reader, Lorimer and many others. A Pagan Place was preceded by the single The Big Music. \\"The Big Music\\", the name of the single's A-side track, was adopted by some commentators as a description of The Waterboys' sound, and is still used to refer to the musical style of their first three albums. The release of the album was followed by further touring including support for The Pretenders and U2 and a show at the Glastonbury Festival. The band began to record new material in early 1985 for a new album, with Wilkinson leaving the band to join China Crisis. Late in the sessions future Waterboy Steve Wickham added his violin to the track The Pan Within; he had been invited after Scott had heard him on a Sinead O'Connor demo recorded at Karl Wallinger's house. The Waterboys (officially a trio of Scott, Thistlethwaite and Wallinger with a slew of guests) released their third album, This Is the Sea, in October 1985. It sold better than either of the two earlier albums, and managed to get into the Top Forty. A single from it, \\"The Whole of the Moon\\", reached number 26 in the UK. Promotion efforts were hampered by Scott's refusal to perform on Top of the Pops, which insisted that its performers lip sync. (However, in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines, when the New Wave era started around this period, the group's biggest hit single out of this third album was \\"The Pan Within\\", aside from \\"The Whole of the Moon\\" and \\"Don't Bang The Drum\\".) The album release was followed by successful tours of the UK and North America with Wickham becoming a full-time member, Marco Sin replacing Martyn Swain on bass, and Chris Whitten replacing Kevin Wilkinson on drums. Towards the end of the tour Wallinger left to form his own band, World Party, and was replaced by Guy Chambers. At the same time, drummer Dave Ruffy replaced Chris Whitten. What year did they not recrd","completion":"Since The Waterboys were formed in 1983, we can assume they were active in recording and performing throughout the years following their formation. However, the information provided does not specifically mention they were recording in every single year. Therefore, it is not possible for me to determine which specific year they did not record, considering the limited information given."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: True Grit Movie plot: Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), the narrator and protagonist, explains that her father was murdered by Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) when she was 14 years old. While collecting her father's body in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Mattie asks the local sheriff about the search for Chaney. He tells her that Chaney has fled with \\"Lucky\\" Ned Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, not believing she has the money to hire him. She raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill. Texas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town after pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes to team up with Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn but he leaves without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward. After being refused passage on the ferry that conveyed Cogburn and LaBoeuf, Mattie crosses the river on horseback. LaBoeuf expresses his displeasure by birching Mattie with a stick, but Cogburn eventually allows Mattie to accompany them. After a dispute over their respective service with the Confederate States of America, Cogburn ends their arrangement and LaBoeuf leaves to pursue Chaney on his own. Cogburn and Mattie meet a trail doctor who directs them to an empty dugout for shelter. They find two outlaws, Quincy and Moon, and interrogate them. Quincy insists they have no information about the Pepper gang, but eventually Moon divulges what he knows; Quincy fatally stabs Moon, and Cogburn shoots Quincy dead. Before dying, Moon says Pepper and his gang will be returning for fresh horses that night. LaBoeuf arrives at the dugout and is confronted by the Pepper gang.

I was joined by approximately a dozen friends at Outback Steak House ( since I so rarely go there ) and a fun time was had . One of the gifts that Mike got me was an electronic Indiana Jones whip that makes the whipping noise and plays the theme song . I brought that in to work and it was much better received than I expected , especially by the guys who have lightsabres in their cubes . Why did Mike get the narrator such a silly gift ?","completion":"Mike got the narrator such a silly gift, the electronic Indiana Jones whip, for several reasons. Firstly, the choice of a whimsical gift like this shows that Mike knows the narrator well and has a strong understanding of their interests and sense of humor. This implies that they share a close connection and have a good level of comfort with each other. By offering a quirky gift, Mike demonstrates that he values their friendship and wants to bring joy and amusement to the narrator. Secondly, it may be inferred that the narrator is a fan of Indiana Jones, given their positive reaction to the gift. Mike could have selected this unique present to cater to the narrator's fandom and evoke nostalgia. The whip, which produces a whipping sound and plays the iconic theme song, serves as a light-hearted tribute to the beloved movies, allowing the narrator to more deeply connect with their favorite character in a fun, interactive way. Moreover, offering a playful gift like this fosters social interaction and bonding among peers. As evident from the passage, the electronic whip was a hit at the workplace, particularly among coworkers who already had lightsabers in their cubicles. By giving such a gift, Mike inadvertently provided an opportunity for the narrator to forge connections and share light moments with their colleagues, ultimately strengthening their social dynamics. Furthermore, Mike might have opted for a silly gift to add an element of surprise and delight to the narrator's birthday celebrations. Instead of presenting a conventional and expected gift, Mike's whimsical choice stands out in a memorable way, leaving a lasting impression on the narrator and other attendees. In conclusion, Mike got the narrator the electronic Indiana Jones whip as a gift for a multitude of reasons. These include their close relationship, the narrator's appreciation for Indiana Jones, the opportunity to spark positive interactions among peers, and the element of surprise. Such a silly and delightful gift exemplifies the strong bond between the narrator and Mike while creating memorable moments for all involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - The Argentine War of Independence was fought from 1810 to 1818 by Argentine patriotic forces under Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli and José de San Martín against royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown. On July 9, 1816, an assembly met in San Miguel de Tucumán, declared full independence with provisions for a national constitution. - Juan Bautista Cabral ( ca . 1789 -- 3 February 1813 ) was an Argentine soldier of the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers who died in the Battle of San Lorenzo , while he was aiding then Colonel Don José de San Martín , whose horse had fallen to enemy fire . The action of Cabral in this first military confrontation of the Argentine War of Independence gave him lasting fame and a prominent place among Argentine patriots . - Málaga is a municipality, capital of the Province of Málaga, in the Autonomous Community of Andalusia, Spain. With a population of 569,130 in 2015, it is the second-most populous city of Andalusia and the sixth-largest in Spain. The southernmost large city in Europe, it lies on the Costa del Sol (\\"Coast of the Sun\\") of the Mediterranean, about east of the Strait of Gibraltar and about north of Africa. - The Spanish Empire was one of the largest empires in history. It reached the peak of its military, political and economic power under the Spanish Habsburgs, through most of the 16th and 17th centuries, and its greatest territorial extent under the House of Bourbon in the 18th century, when it was the largest empire in the world. The Spanish Empire became the foremost global power of its time and was the first to be called \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\". - The Argentine Army (\\"Ejército Argentino\\", EA) is the land armed force branch of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic and the senior military service of the country. Under the Argentine Constitution, the President of Argentina is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, exercising his or her command authority through the Minister of Defense. - San Miguel de Tucumán (usually called simply Tucumán) is the capital of the Tucumán Province, located in northern Argentina from Buenos Aires. It is the fifth-largest city of Argentina after Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Rosario and Mendoza and the most important of the northern region. The Spanish Conquistador founded the city in 1565 in the course of an expedition from present-day Peru. Tucumán moved to its present site in 1685. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Baptism of Fire is a 1943 American documentary film starring Elisha Cook Jr. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. - The Battle of San Lorenzo was fought on February 3, 1813 in San Lorenzo, Argentina, then part of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. A Spanish Royalist force under the command of Antonio Zabala was defeated by the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers, under the command of José de San Martín. This battle was the baptism of fire for this military unit, and for San Martín in the Spanish American wars of independence. - The Cisplatine War, commonly known as the Argentine-Brazilian War, was an armed conflict over an area known as Banda Oriental or the \\"\\"Eastern Strip\\"\\" (roughly present-day Uruguay) in the 1820s between the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and the Empire of Brazil in the aftermath of the United Provinces' emancipation from Spain. - Yapeyú is a town in the province of Corrientes, Argentina, in the San Martín Department. It has about 2,000 inhabitants as per the , and it is known throughout the country because it was the birthplace of General José de San Martín (17781850), hero of the War of Independence. One of its notable monuments is the Arco Trunco. - The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, after the French invasion of Spain during Europe's Napoleonic Wars. Although various regions of Spanish America objected to crown policies the restricted trade and privileged Spanish-born officials over American-born, \\"there was little interest in outright independence; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French.\\" These conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. When the Central Junta fell to the French invasion, in 1810, numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas. The conflicts among these colonies and with Spain eventually resulted in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south to Mexico in the north in the first third of the 19th century. Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the SpanishAmerican War in 1898. - The Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers is the name of two Argentine Army regiments of two different time periods: a historic regiment that operated from 1812 to 1826, and a modern cavalry unit that was organized in 1903. The first Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers, formed in 1812, fought in the Argentine War of Independence under José de San Martín, and the Cisplatine War, subsequently becoming the Presidential bodyguard in 1825. Refusing to replenish its membership with soldiers who had not fought in the Argentine War of Independence, the regiment disbanded in 1826. - Juan José Castelli (July 19, 1764 October 12, 1812) was an Argentine lawyer. He was one of the leaders of the May Revolution, which started the Argentine War of Independence. He led an ill-fated military campaign in Upper Peru. - José Francisco de San Martín y Matorras (25 February 1778 17 August 1850), known simply as José de San Martín, was an Argentine general and the prime leader of the southern part of South America's successful struggle for independence from the Spanish Empire. Born in Yapeyú, Corrientes, in modern-day Argentina, he left his mother country at the early age of seven to study in Málaga, Spain. - Colonel (abbreviated Col., Col or COL and pronounced , similar to \\"kernel\\") is a senior military officer rank below the general officer ranks. However, in some small military forces, such as those of Iceland or the Vatican, colonel is the highest rank. It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations. - Manuel José Joaquín del Corazón de Jesús Belgrano (3 June 1770 20 June 1820), usually referred to as Manuel Belgrano, was an Argentine economist, lawyer, politician, and military leader. He took part in the Argentine Wars of Independence and created the Flag of Argentina. He is regarded as one of the main \\"Libertadores\\" of the country.

Paragraph: To determine the factors that predict in-hospital mortality among patients who require hospitalization for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Study design: Prospective observational study of all patients who were admitted to six hospitals in Edmonton, AL, Canada, with a diagnosis of CAP from November 15, 2000, to November 14, 2002. Pneumonia was defined as two or more respiratory symptoms and signs and an opacity on a chest radiograph as interpreted by the attending physician. Results: A total of 3,043 patients were enrolled in the study, 246 of whom died (8.1%). On multivariate analysis, increasing pneumonia severity score, increasing age, site of care, consultation with a respirologist or infectious diseases physician, and functional status at the time of admission were all independently predictive of mortality. Increasing pneumonia severity risk score, increasing age, site of hospitalization, functional status, and consultation with an infectious diseases physician or a respirologist were independently associated with both early (< 5 days) and late (> 5 days) mortality. In contrast, partial or complete use of the pneumonia pathway was associated with decreased early mortality, but had no effect on late mortality. A low lymphocyte count and a high serum potassium level were associated with early but not with late mortality. The type of antibiotic therapy had an effect on late but not on early mortality. Conclusions: Functional status at the time of hospital admission is a powerful predictor of mortality and should be incorporated into any scores or models that are used to predict mortality. While there are some common predictors of early and late in-hospital mortality, early mortality is not affected by the timing or type of antibiotic therapy, whereas late mortality is influenced by the type of antibiotic therapy. Hyperkalemia and lymphopenia are associated with early mortality.

Write an article based on this summary: Former UK PM Tony Blair would support the US if military action was needed in Iraq, a top US official claimed in a memo written a year before the war. Article:","completion":"Title: A Year Before the War - a Memo Reveals Tony Blair's Commitment to Supporting the US in Iraq Introduction: Though the Iraq War began in 2003, a recently revealed memo, written a year before the war, has shed light on former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's commitment to supporting the United States in its military efforts if the need arose. This revelation has sparked conversations about Blair's role in the decision-making process leading up to the war. Memo Details: The memo, penned by a top US official, claimed that in the event of military action needed in Iraq, Tony Blair would offer his unwavering support to the United States. While the exact details and motivations behind this commitment remain unclear, the mere existence of the memo showcases the inevitability that stemmed from Blair's alliance with then-US President George W. Bush. Blair's Relationship with Bush: Blair's strong support for Bush's administration, particularly the controversial decision to invade Iraq, marked a significant moment in British-American relations. The two leaders shared a close working relationship, with Blair often regarded as the most pro-American British Prime Minister in recent memory. The contents of the memo confirm what was already suspected - that Blair was prepared to stand by Bush, even when faced with the possibility of war. Public Reaction and the Chilcot Report: Recent revelations about the memo have led to increased scrutiny of Blair's actions leading up to the war. Many have questioned whether the former Prime Minister allowed himself to be unduly influenced by Bush, which may have contributed to the UK's eventual decision to join the United States in its Iraq invasion. The Chilcot Report, an inquiry conducted by Sir John Chilcot into the decision-making process for the Iraq War, concluded in 2016 that the UK's actions in Iraq were undertaken before all peaceful options had been exhausted. Despite these findings, Blair has maintained that the war was necessary to disarm Saddam Hussein's regime and protect global security. Implications of the Memo: The disclosure of the memo not only highlights Blair's commitment to the Bush administration but also sparks further inquiry into the decision-making process that led to the Iraq War. The memo raises questions about whether the UK adequately weighed its options and considered the potential consequences of military action. It also underscores the difficulty of navigating the complex foreign policy landscape when entering into a close alliance with another country, as well as the potential for pressure from one nation to influence the actions of its ally. Overall, the existence of the memo serves as a somber reminder of the high stakes involved with any decision to engage in military conflict. Conclusion: Though the Iraq War has been over for nearly a decade, the recent discovery of the memo from a year before the war commenced highlights Tony Blair's dedication to supporting the US in its military endeavors. The implications of this alliance remain a point of contention and discussion, particularly when considering the complex decision-making process and subsequent consequences of military action. The memo serves as a stark reminder of the gravity of political alliances and their potential impact on critical decisions regarding war and peace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you use Facebook to get your news, please - for the love of democracy - read this first Facebook’s 1.44 billion users rely on the site for lots of things: keeping in touch, sharing photos, casual stalking. But if you get your political news through Facebook, as more than 60 percent of millennials do, please browse with extreme caution: The site doesn’t show you everything, and may subtly skew your point of view. This is not, of course, a new fear; moral panic over “echo chambers” and “filter bubbles” is as old as the social Web, itself. But a new survey by the Pew Center, released on Monday, suggests there may be some new urgency here. Per that survey, a majority of American Internet users now get political news from Facebook — and the 2016 elections, as we know, are in just over a year. That’s really important, and important to understand, because Facebook is quite unlike traditional conduits of news. (Think: your local ABC affiliate, your gossipy neighbor, this page, what have you.) As in those more traditional settings, Facebook gives you a great deal of control over which sources you follow and what you choose to read. But unlike those other, traditional sources, Facebook also hides many stories selectively. According to a recent Washington Post experiment, as much as 72 percent of the new material your friends and subscribed pages post never actually shows up in your News Feed. Which might be fine, when we’re talking about your ex-co-worker’s baby pictures — but what about if we’re talking about a political scandal? “A longer-term question that arises from this data [about Facebook as a political news source],” the Pew report says, “is what younger Americans’ reliance on social media for news might mean for the political system.” By now, it should be common knowledge that the News Feed does not show you every post your friends put on Facebook. Unfortunately, there’s still a major misconception around how News Feed works: in a recent study from the University of Illinois, 62.5 percent of participants had no idea Facebook screened out any posts. Facebook has a good reason for doing this, mind you: If you saw every post, you’d be overwhelmed. There’d simply be too many to read. (This is a problem Twitter’s having, incidentally.) So instead, Facebook does a little math and, based on a range of engagement factors, tries to predict the posts you’re most interested in, and only places those in your News Feed. The math behind the News Feed changes constantly, and Facebook regularly rejiggers it to meet user needs. (You may recall a certain outcry over “manipulative” algorithmic changes in July 2014.) [What Facebook doesn’t show you] Anyway, none of this is inherently bad or nefarious. In fact, for the casual, social Facebook user, it’s probably really good. The problem is that more and more people are using Facebook for more and more important things — like informing how they vote — without entirely understanding how it works. “It’s kind of [like] waking up in ‘The Matrix’ in a way,” said one newly enlightened participant in that University of Illinois study. “I mean you have what you think as your reality” — but it’s actually filtered, moderated. Facebook has, unsurprisingly, worked very hard to shed the impression that this filtering may somehow hurt its users or their media literacy. In May, researchers working for the site published a very high-profile, very controversial paper on the “ideological diversity” of information in the News Feed. The communications scholar Christian Sandvig called it the “‘it’s not our fault’ study” — a peculiarly deliberate attempt to prove that, even if filter bubbles do exist, their algorithm isn’t to blame. As Sandvig and others have pointed out, though, that isn’t actually what Facebook’s data shows. For one thing, the study wasn’t conclusive: It only looked at a small and highly non-representative user sample. On top of that, the study shows that the algorithm does tweak political news in three important, if modest, ways. To wit: Again, none of this is necessarily nefarious or shocking. (“What else would a good filter algorithm be doing other than filtering for what it thinks you will like?” Sandvig wrote.) But it does mean that, when you use Facebook as a source for political news, that news is modestly more likely to flatter your existing point of view. “Selectivity and polarization are happening on Facebook,” sums up Sandvig, “and the news feed curation algorithm acts to modestly accelerate” both of those things. It’s no wonder, really, that highly partisan news sources tend to do very well on Facebook — they speak to the biases of both users and the network. It might be hard to see the big so-what in all of this. After all, if you’re just one user cruising along through your News Feed, you want a service that’s pleasant and comfortable for you. You don’t want to be bombarded with rage-inducing partisan news in between your memes and your mom’s stories and your pet videos. But consider, for a minute, that more than half of all American adults use Facebook — enough people, some scholars theorize, to swing a national election. As more of those people use Facebook for news, we risk “accelerating” polarization for a large slice of the U.S. population. And that’s too bad, really, both because political polarization can be blamed for a host of ills, and because social networks could really be a force for good here. One analysis of Twitter found, for instance, that ideologically diverse networks tend to yield more moderate people — proof positive, its author wrote, that social media has “rich potential … to transform the political process.” There are, at least in theory, technical ways around this problem. The sociologist Zeynep Tufekci has called for Facebook to hand more filtering control directly over to its users: “At a personal level,” she wrote, “I’d love to have the choice to set my newsfeed algorithm to ‘please show more content I’d likely disagree with.” (Balancer, a browser extension/research project that took this approach toward news site reading, is the only known tool to increase “diverse exposure” clearly and measurably.) Meanwhile, Jonathan Zittrain — a law professor at Harvard — has called for Facebook to declare itself an “information fiduciary,” much like lawyers and doctors do already. In exchange for, say, a tax break, the site would promise to offer a depersonalized, unfiltered News Feed experience, among other things. Unfortunately, these solutions seem unlikely for now — and in the meantime, the available fixes are both very individual and far less ambitious. If you use Facebook to access political news, consider toggling from “top stories” to “most recent.” (That option’s in the left-hand rail, under “Favorites.”) Alternately, think about supplementing your Facebook diet with news from somewhere else. Pew also has a new analysis on the news sources that liberals and conservatives like best: Take a gander at some stories from your ideological opposite.

Background: Robert James Fitzsimmons was born on 26 May 1863 in Helston, Cornwall, England, the youngest of seven boys and five girls born to James and Jane (nee Strongman) Fitzsimmons. Not long before his birth, his parents had moved from his father's native Ireland to Cornwall, where his mother came from, in order for his father to find work as a policeman. Fitzsimmons received his early education at the National school in Helston. In 1873, the family moved again; James, Jane and their youngest five children sailed on the Adamant for the 93 day journey to Lyttelton, New Zealand. Context: In 1896, Fitzsimmons won a disputed version of the World Heavyweight Championship in a fight in Langtry, Texas, against the Irish fighter Peter Maher. On 17 March 1897, in Carson City, Nevada, he knocked out American Jim Corbett, generally recognised as the legitimate World Heavyweight Champion (having won the title from John L. Sullivan in 1892) in round 14. This constituted a remarkable achievement, as Jim Corbett, a skilled boxer, weighed one stone 3 pounds (17 lb) more than Fitzsimmons. He out-boxed Fitzsimmons for several rounds, knocked him down in the sixth round and badly damaged his face with his jab, left hook and right hand, but Fitzsimmons kept coming and Corbett began to tire. In the 14th round, Fitzsimmons won the title with his \\"solar plexus\\" punch. Corbett collapsed in agony. Fitzsimmons' \\"solar plexus\\" punch became legendary, although he himself may never have used the phrase. The entire fight was filmed by Enoch J. Rector and released to cinemas as The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight, the longest film ever released at the time. Using her maiden name, it was covered by Nellie Verrill Mighels Davis, the first woman to report a prize fight. Fitzsimmons spent the rest of 1897 and 1898 doing stage tours. In 1899, Fitzsimmons fought James J. Jeffries at the Coney Island Athletic Club near Brooklyn, New York. Most people gave Jeffries little chance, even though at over 15 stones (95 kg) he massively outweighed his opponent and was far younger, but Jeffries lifted the World Heavyweight Champion from Fitzsimmons with an 11th-round knockout. In June 1901 Fitzsimmons took part in a wrestling match against Gus Ruhlin. He lost and went back to boxing. He then enjoyed legitimate boxing knockouts of leading contenders Ruhlin and Tom Sharkey. In 1901 he published a book Physical Culture and Self-Defense (Philadelphia: D. Biddle). In 1902, he and Jeffries had a rematch, once again with the World Heavyweight Champion at stake. Fitzsimmons battered Jeffries, who suffered horrible punishment. With his nose and cheek bones broken, most would have sympathized with Jeffries had he quit, but he kept going until his enormous strength and youth wore down Bob and he knocked him out cold in round eight. Question: Who else did he fight against?. Whats the answer?","completion":"In addition to the notable fights against Peter Maher, Jim Corbett, and James J. Jeffries, Robert Fitzsimmons had a lengthy career which included numerous other opponents. Some of the notable names he fought against were: 1. Jack \\"Nonpareil\\" Dempsey: On January 14, 1891, Fitzsimmons won the World Middleweight Championship by defeating Jack Dempsey in a fight in New Orleans. Fitzsimmons knocked Dempsey out in the 13th round. 2. Dan Creedon: On March 2, 1894, Fitzsimmons fought against Dan Creedon, a New Zealand-born boxer, in New Orleans. He successfully defended his World Middleweight Championship title by knocking Creedon out in the second round. 3. Tom Sharkey: Fitzsimmons fought Tom Sharkey twice in his career.

If he needs it to have less resistance, he should add a resistor that is shorter. or longer? Assuming that: Longer length resistors will offer more resistance than shorter resistors. Answer:","completion":"Ed is working with a circuit and needs to add a resistor with less resistance. To understand whether he should add a resistor that is shorter or longer, we need to consider the factors that affect resistance in a resistor. Resistance is determined by a combination of factors, including the material, length, cross-sectional area, and temperature of the resistor. The relationship between these factors can be described by the formula: R = ρ * (L / A) Where: - R is the resistance, - ρ (rho) is the resistivity of the material, - L is the length, and - A is the cross-sectional area. In this case, Ed is trying to minimize resistance, so he needs to consider the length (L) of the resistor he's adding. According to the assumption provided, longer-length resistors will offer more resistance than shorter resistors. This means that the resistive characteristics of Ed's chosen resistor material are such that the resistance is directly proportional to the length of the resistor (i.e., as the length increases, so does the resistance). This relationship can be observed in the above formula, where an increase in the length (L) value leads to an increase in the resistance (R). Given this information, Ed should add a resistor that is shorter in length. A shorter resistor, as per the assumption, will have a lower resistance, allowing Ed to achieve his desired outcome of adding a resistor with less resistance to his circuit. It is important to note that there are other factors at play in determining a resistor's resistance, such as the cross-sectional area and material resistivity. However, since the given assumption and the question specifically pertain to the length of the resistor, our answer focuses on the length aspect of resistance. In summary, to add a resistor with less resistance to his circuit, Ed should opt for a shorter resistor, assuming that longer-length resistors offer more resistance than shorter resistors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brian asked Donald how to prepare glycerol stock since","completion":"Brian asked Donald how to prepare glycerol stock since both of them had never made it before and they wanted to ensure they were following the correct procedures to obtain accurate results. As the process of making a glycerol stock is essential for preserving bacterial cultures and maintaining their viability, it was important to consult with someone who had experience with this technique. Donald started by explaining the purpose of glycerol stocks in the lab. He mentioned that glycerol stocks are used to store bacterial cultures for long-term periods, effectively freezing the growth of the bacteria while preserving their genetic material. This is particularly useful for researchers who need to work with the same strain of bacteria over extended periods, ensuring that they always have access to a viable, genetically consistent source. Next, Donald provided a step-by-step guide to the preparation of a glycerol stock: 1. First, grow a fresh bacterial culture in a suitable liquid medium, such as Luria Broth (LB), until the bacteria reaches a logarithmic phase of growth. This usually takes between 16 to 18 hours. 2. Prepare a sterile 50% glycerol solution by mixing equal volumes of 100% glycerol and sterile distilled water. It is important to maintain aseptic conditions to prevent any contamination of the glycerol stock. 3. After the bacterial culture has reached the appropriate growth stage, aliquot 1.5 mL of the culture into a sterile cryovial (or another suitable storage container) using a sterile pipette. 4. Then, add 0.5 mL of the 50% glycerol solution to the cryovial, resulting in a final glycerol concentration of approximately 17% (v/v) in the mixture. 5. Mix the bacterial culture and glycerol solution by gently inverting the cryovial several times to ensure thorough mixing. Avoid vigorous shaking, as it may damage the bacterial cells. 6. Label the cryovial with relevant information, including strain details, date, and your initials or lab identifier. This will help to identify the stock for future use. 7. Finally, store the glycerol stock at -80°C for long-term storage. This low temperature inhibits bacterial growth and metabolism, effectively preserving the genetic material and keeping the bacterial cells viable for future use. In addition to these instructions, Donald provided some helpful tips: - Be sure to use fresh bacterial cultures to minimize the risk of contaminating the glycerol stock with other species or strains. - Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles of the glycerol stock, as this can reduce the viability of the bacterial cells. - When reviving the bacteria, simply scrape a small amount of the glycerol stock onto a solid agar medium or into a liquid broth; there is no need to thaw the entire glycerol stock. Following Donald's guidance, Brian was more confident in his ability to prepare a glycerol stock and was grateful that he could now preserve his bacterial cultures for future research."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two birds meet each other: This is the initial stage where two adult birds of the same species encounter each other for mating. 2. Egg is produced after fertilization: The female bird's ovum is fertilized by the male bird's sperm, resulting in the formation of a zygote, which eventually develops into an embryo inside the egg. 3. Mother sits on the egg until it hatches: The female bird incubates the egg by sitting on it to provide warmth and protection, ensuring the proper development of the embryo inside. 4. Bird hatches: The fully developed chick inside the egg eventually breaks the shell and emerges as a hatchling. 5. Grows up: The hatchling is nurtured by its parents, grows bigger, and develops features like feathers and the ability to fly. 6. Flee the nest: The bird, now a fledgling, leaves its parents' nest to become independent and start exploring its surroundings. 7.

Carrie signed up for an improv group while Christine did not, because","completion":"Carrie signed up for an improv group while Christine did not, because their individual interests, personalities, and life circumstances led them to make different choices regarding extracurricular activities. Carrie, a natural performer with a passion for creative expression, was drawn to the spontaneous and imaginative nature of improv. She knew that joining an improv group would provide her with an excellent opportunity to hone her acting skills, foster emotional resilience, and make new connections with like-minded individuals who shared her enthusiasm for the arts. On the other hand, Christine possessed a more introverted personality and was not inclined towards performing in front of an audience. She was more comfortable engaging in activities that allowed her to observe, listen, and participate in a less exposed manner. Furthermore, Christine's other hobbies and commitments, such as playing a musical instrument, participating in a book club, or volunteering at a local charity, may have influenced her decision to forgo joining the improv group. In addition to these factors, practical considerations could have also played a role in their contrasting decisions. Carrie might have been able to easily fit the improv group meetings and performances into her schedule, while Christine may have faced time constraints or conflicting obligations that made it difficult for her to commit to a regular group. Additionally, the accessibility of the improv group's meeting location and any associated fees or costs could have impacted their choices as well. Another possible reason is that they had different social circles and support systems. Carrie may have had friends or family members who were actively involved in the local theater community, encouraging her to give improv a try and supporting her pursuit of this new interest. Conversely, Christine may have lacked strong connections to the performing arts world, and her existing relationships with friends and family might have revolved around different interests and activities. In conclusion, the reason Carrie signed up for an improv group while Christine did not can be explained by a complex interplay of factors, including their distinct personalities, interests, and life circumstances. While Christine may have opted against joining the improv group for various reasons, both she and Carrie can still pursue their preferred activities and experiences, allowing them to grow and learn from their unique paths in life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

First, we look at the overall message: the user is responding to someone saying it's okay not to worry about something, and they mention it's just their luck that they didn't make it on a specific night. 2. Next, we examine the key expressions: - \\"it's ok don't worry about it\\": This indicates a reassuring and somewhat positive tone. - \\"just my luck\\": This phrase generally has a negative connotation, as it often implies that something unfortunate happened. - \\"I didn't make it on that night\\": This part also has a negative feel, as the user missed something. - \\"oh well\\": This expression is used to express acceptance or resignation, which can be seen as neutral or leaning slightly negative. - \\":-/\\": This emoticon is typically used to convey mixed emotions, confusion, or slight disappointment, which suggests a negative tone. 3. Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the tweet is a mix of different emotions, but the majority seem to lean towards the negative side. Conclusion: The sentiment of the tweet is (a). negative."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

This process often involves physical motions with objects, such as moving them, arranging them in a certain way, mixing them, shaking them, etc. Input: To remove a zipper from a leather bag, you can Output:","completion":"1. Gather the necessary tools before starting: a small, flat-head screwdriver, a pair of needle-nose pliers, and a seam ripper. 2. Place the leather bag on a flat and sturdy working surface to have proper control over the process. 3. With the seam ripper, carefully cut and remove the stitches that connect the zipper to the leather bag. Be cautious not to damage the leather by holding the seam ripper at a slight angle away from the bag's surface. Work along the entire length of the zipper on both sides. 4. After all stitches are removed, gently separate the zipper from the leather bag. The zipper should now be held in place only by the stops at its ends. 5. Identify the side where the zipper puller sits when the zipper is fully closed. Using the flat-head screwdriver, carefully lift and remove the metal stop from the end of the zipper track on this side. You may need to wiggle the screwdriver or use the needle-nose pliers to loosen it completely. 6. Once the metal stop is removed, slide the zipper puller off the zipper track towards the opposite end. If there is a second metal stop, gently remove it while holding the zipper so the track remains intact. 7. Now that the zipper is separated from the bag, check the leather for any remaining threads or damaged areas. Use the needle-nose pliers or your fingers to pull out any leftover threads gently. Following these steps will allow you to successfully remove a zipper from a leather bag without causing damage to the bag or the zipper."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Two oceans have divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of their floor. The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters. Which ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock? Hint: At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.","completion":"Given the information provided and based on our understanding of plate tectonics and mid-ocean ridge (MOR) processes, it can be inferred that the Pacific Ocean would experience more cooling of hot molten rock than the Arctic Ocean. The key element of this reasoning is the number of diverging tectonic plates in each ocean. As you've identified, the Arctic Ocean has only a single dormant divergent plate boundary, while the Pacific Ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates. Each of these divergent boundaries represents a zone where new oceanic crust is continuously being created through the process of seafloor spreading. Seafloor spreading occurs as magma rises from the mantle at the diverging plate boundaries, forming new oceanic crust as it cools and solidifies. This expansion of heated materials under the seafloor, known as adiabatic expansion, combined with the process of plate separation, results in the release of hot molten rock materials. In turn, this causes active volcanic activity and the creation of new oceanic crust. Given that this process is happening at seven diverging boundaries in the Pacific Ocean, compared to just one in the Arctic Ocean, we can conclude that there is a higher volume of magma cooling that occurs in the Pacific Ocean. Moreover, because most of these are at the bottom of the oceans, more newly formed seafloor and, therefore, more cooling of hot molten rock, occurs in the Pacific Ocean. The differences in these two oceans' plate tectonics contribute significantly to each ocean's unique physical and biological characteristics. One primary consequence of these increased divergent plate boundaries in the Pacific Ocean is that there is likely to be a greater presence of 'black smokers' or deep-sea vents. These underwater geysers are fascinating oases for extremophile organisms and marks of intense volcanic and tectonic activity. In short, the tectonic characteristics of the Pacific Ocean make it a more active and dynamically evolving system in comparison to the Arctic Ocean when it comes to underwater volcanic activity, seafloor spreading, and the cooling of hot molten rock."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

OPT: A). that it will improve the market value B). that it will have no impact C). the author has not given thought to market value D). not enough information Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. Question: What effect does the author probably believe that decluttering the house will have on it's market value?

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.
