Answer the following question: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs. Question: Chan's mother believes that: Options: - Chan should speak up more - not enough information - Chan was too small for his age - Chan's birth was a curse on her garden === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"- Chan's birth was a curse on her garden"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:One of the crucial questions following Britain's vote to leave the European Union is what will happen to the land border separating Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland. There is widespread agreement among UK politicians that there should be no return to what they call a hard border and that the Common Travel Area (CTA) should be maintained after Brexit. These objectives have been echoed by leading European politicians, such as the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, and chief Brexit negotiator for the EU Michel Barnier. But as things stand, no party has yet put forward a workable plan for ensuring that both people and goods can continue to cross the border without checkpoints. And we still do not know what Brexit will actually look like. The exact number of individuals that cross between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland every day is difficult to quantify, but the figure is likely to be in the tens of thousands. The Centre for Cross Border Studies, which has offices in Armagh and Dublin, has estimated that between 23,000 and 30,000 people cross the border daily for work. This includes non-Irish and non-UK EU citizens living and working on different sides of the Irish land border. The figure is believed to be a conservative estimate, with many more making the journey to and from the Republic of Ireland to attend schools and hospital appointments. Speaking at a House of Lords select committee in 2016, Bernie McCrory, the head of Co-operation and Working Together (CAWT), said that the health and social care group's nurses routinely crossed the border several times a day. The days of the Troubles are gone, and the border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic lie rusting and unused. But now the UK is getting ready to leave the EU. Hospital patients and schoolchildren and cross-border workers are among those who have to make the daily journey. How do they see the road ahead? Special report: The hardest border If the rest of the UK is not included, then Northern Ireland's biggest export market is its nearest neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. While just under one-third of its total manufactured goods - Â£2.4bn - were sold across its land border in 2016, of Northern Ireland's Â£7.7bn export total for the same period, the majority of sales - Â£4.2bn - were to the EU. The agri-food sector - trade in food and farm produce - dominates trade in goods between the north and south. A 2016 UK parliamentary report, citing the Irish Farmers' Association, says that 350,000 lambs went from north to south, 500,000 pigs from south to north, and millions of litres of milk travelled in both directions over the course of a year. Almost 30% of Northern Ireland's milk is processed in the Republic of Ireland, where it is made into butter and cheese or used in infant formula. For members of the EU, goods and produce such as these can cross borders freely. But if negotiations between the UK and the EU fail to reach a trade agreement, or if the agreement is less favourable than that enjoyed by member states, it could mean that tariffs - taxes imposed on imported items - could become costly. In the EU referendum, Northern Ireland voted to remain by a majority of 56% to 44%. Some - but not all - of the parties supported that view. Here are some details from each of the main parties' manifestos, stating their aims in terms of Brexit and the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) The DUP is in favour of Northern Ireland leaving the EU but says that Brexit does not mean \\"leaving Europe\\". It adds that it will prioritise maintaining the CTA between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Aims: DUP manifesto in full Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) The SDLP is a pro-European party that campaigned for Northern Ireland to remain part of the EU. In its manifesto, it states that Brexit will create an unprecedented situation in which one member of the CTA, the Republic of Ireland, is part of the EU while the other is not. The SDLP says it will oppose the hardening of borders, in order to protect cross-border workers, farms that straddle both sides and businesses that rely heavily on trade with the south. Aims: SDLP manifesto in full Sinn Fein The party says that the \\"only credible approach\\" to Brexit is for Northern Ireland to receive special status within the EU that will uphold the democratic vote of citizens, but will also ensure that \\"the frontier between the EU and Britain will not be on the island of Ireland\\". Aims: Sinn Fein manifesto in full Alliance Party The pro-European Alliance Party supported a Remain vote. It opposes a hard Brexit and supports a second referendum following negotiations, to allow citizens to decide whether any agreement reached is better than EU membership. The party also argues that Northern Ireland is a special case because its citizens have an automatic right to be Irish citizens and, therefore, to be citizens of the EU. Legally, Northern Ireland would, post-Brexit, have the capacity to opt back into the EU through joining a united Ireland, it says. Aims: Alliance Party manifesto in full Ulster Unionist Party The UUP's view on Brexit was that, on balance, it was beneficial for Northern Ireland to remain within the EU. The party says it has a vision to make Northern Ireland the \\"UK's Gateway to Europe\\". Aims: UUP manifesto in full Read more on Reality Check Follow us on Twitter Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"When the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, it raised questions about the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both UK and European politicians agree that they don't want a hard border, which means they want to keep things as they are now, with people and goods moving freely. However, no one has come up with a plan to make this happen after Brexit. Many people cross this border every day, and it is very important for trade. If the UK and the EU can't agree on a trade deal, it might become more expensive to move goods across the border.

My grandparents moved from the condo to the house, as the Choices: *condo had enough room.; *house had enough room.;","completion":"My grandparents moved from the condo to the house, as the house had enough room. The decision to make the move was not taken lightly, as they had spent many happy years enjoying the convenience of condo life. However, as their family grew and their children had their own children, it became apparent that the size of the condo was inadequate for the many family gatherings they enjoyed hosting. The house my grandparents moved to was a beautiful, old Victorian home that had once belonged to a wealthy family. Positioned in a friendly neighborhood, not too far from the condo they had previously lived in, it boasted an ample backyard and a beautiful view overlooking a nearby park. The first time my grandparents set eyes on the house, they knew it would be the perfect place to make new memories with their growing family. As they settled into their new home, my grandparents went to great lengths to make the space welcoming and comfortable for everyone. They renovated the house, respecting the original architectural elements while integrating modern amenities. The large rustic kitchen was updated with the latest appliances and a generous island perfect for cooking and gathering. The living room was adorned with comfortable furniture and a cozy fireplace, where they could spend evenings curled up with their loved ones, sharing stories and laughter. The spacious dining room, with its elongated table and ample seating, quickly became the heart of the house. It was in this room that countless family meals, holiday celebrations, and Sunday dinners would be enjoyed for years to come. The walls echoed the laughter of grandchildren as they raced around the house, their feet tapping along the polished wooden floorboards. Upstairs, guest rooms and bathrooms were carefully outfitted with everything visitors would need to feel at home. Outside, the backyard was transformed into an idyllic oasis where family and friends could gather, play, and relax. My grandparents planted fruit trees and flowers, tended to by Bee, their lovely Golden Retriever. A large lawn was the perfect spot for playing catch or setting up a badminton net, and the shady patio provided a welcoming retreat for afternoon tea or evening cocktails. Life at the house was always bustling and filled with joy. With doors seemingly always open, loved ones came and went, delighting in the warmth of happy conversations, hearty meals, and the opportunity to connect and create lasting memories. The house was a true embodiment of the love and compassion my grandparents had for their family and friends, and they knew that choosing to move from their beloved condo was the right decision. Years passed, and the family continued to grow. New generations filled the rooms of the beautifully aged Victorian house, and it became a place of comfort and solace, bridging the gap between the old and the new. It became clear that the house was more than just a home; it was a monument to the love my grandparents felt for their family, and a testament to the importance of cherishing the time spent together. And so, with the move from the condo to the house, my grandparents made a choice that would forever shape the lives of their family, nurturing relationships and creating a space where love could flourish. By choosing the house with enough room, they granted their family an enduring gift – the gift of precious time, shared experiences, and memories that will last a lifetime. Indeed, the house became a testament to the power of love to bring people together, and it will forever hold a special place in the history of our family."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Netanyahu can be in crosshairs.","completion":"In light of the preceding text, the following sentence can be elaborated upon: The assertion that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might find himself in the \\"crosshairs\\" refers to the potential political backlash and public anger he might face, should he reject or fail to cooperate in peace negotiation efforts. By withholding the final payment on the \\"gift\\", President Trump aims to ensure that Israel engages in peace talks and contribute to the negotiation process in good faith. If Netanyahu and his administration remain uncooperative or intransigent, the withdrawal of the promised gift would not only thwart their expectations but also illustrate to the Israeli public and the international community that such inflexibility stems from the Israeli government's position. Consequently, the Israeli people might perceive Netanyahu as the reason for losing the gift, and thus, public anger would be directed towards him and his political allies. This, in turn, could weaken his standing with the electorate and negatively affect the vote of confidence in his leadership. In this context, the term \\"crosshairs\\" serves as a metaphor for being the target of public anger and dissatisfaction, placing Netanyahu at the receiving end of the consequences of derailing peace efforts. With political pressure heightened, Netanyahu's decision-making becomes crucial as it determines the outcome involving the gift, his own political position, and the future of peace negotiations. Therefore, the statement that \\"Netanyahu can be in the crosshairs\\" appropriately follows the overarching narrative, emphasizing the potential political ramifications faced by Israel's Prime Minister should he not actively participate in peace talks or compromises, ultimately impacting the prospects for long-term regional stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: who was the first one to invent medicine? Would \\"Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"While the specific statement, \\"Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy\\" is accurate to some degree in terms of formal medical education, it is not a reasonable answer to the question about who invented medicine first. The practice of medicine predates any systematic training, and the history of its invention cannot be attributed to just one individual or civilization. The advent of medicine spans across many cultures and historical eras. While it is difficult to pinpoint the first person to invent medicine, we can trace its origins back to various ancient societies that laid the groundwork for the development and evolution of medicine as we know it today. 1. Prehistoric medicine: It is believed that prehistoric humans used basic forms of medicine, such as herbs and natural remedies, to treat injuries, ailments, and diseases. These forms of medicine were typically derived from observing the behavior of animals and relying on trial and error. 2. Traditional medicine in ancient civilizations: Medicine existed in various forms across ancient civilizations, including ancient Egypt, Sumer, China, and India. Medical practitioners in these societies used a mix of religious beliefs, traditional knowledge, and empirical observations to treat illnesses and diseases. 3. Ancient Greek medicine: The first significant source of systematic medical knowledge comes from ancient Greece, with notable names such as Hippocrates and Galen. Hippocrates (460 - 370 BCE), often referred to as the \\"Father of Medicine,\\" was one of the first to promote the idea of basing medical treatments on rational thought and observation. He is best known for creating the Hippocratic Oath, a code of ethics that still guides modern medical practice. 4. Ancient Roman medicine: The Romans adopted and adapted much of Greek medical knowledge and developed their own systems of public health, hospitals, and medical education. Galen (129 - 200 CE) was a Roman physician who made significant contributions to anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology and is considered one of the most influential figures in medical history. 5. Islamic Golden Age medicine: During the Islamic Golden Age (8th - 13th centuries), significant advancements were made in medicine and pharmacy. Key figures like Al-Razi (854 - 925 CE) and Ibn Sina (Avicenna; 980 - 1037 CE) produced encyclopedic works on medicine that became foundational texts throughout the Islamic world and Western Europe. Coming back to the statement in question, \\"Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy,\\" it is true that medical education became formalized during the Middle Ages, particularly in European universities. The first university to establish a program focused on the study of medicine was the University of Bologna in 1219, followed by several others such as the University of Padua and the University of Montpellier. However, this development pertains to the organization of medical education, not the invention of medicine itself. In conclusion, the first invention of medicine predates the Italian universities mentioned in the statement and involves the collective knowledge of countless individuals and societies over thousands of years. The question of who invented medicine first is complex and multifaceted, with roots in prehistory and major contributions from various ancient civilizations and periods during human history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"A review of laws surrounding the \\"significantly increasing\\" problem of online abuse is urgently needed, former culture secretary Maria Miller says.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Former Culture Secretary Calls for Urgent Review of Laws to Address Growing Online Abuse Introduction: In the digital sphere, the issue of online abuse has permeated every corner of the internet, from social media platforms to online forums. Most recently, former Culture Secretary Maria Miller has expressed her concerns about the rapidly growing problem of online abuse. Miller believes that the present situation calls for an immediate review of the existing laws surrounding this problem, adding that it is high time to reevaluate the legal framework in place. Step 1: Background on Maria Miller and Her Expertise Maria Miller is a British Conservative Party politician, who served as the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport from 2012 to 2014. Given her expertise in overseeing areas concerning media and addressing matters related to internet content, she is well-positioned to advocate for a comprehensive review of online abuse laws. Step 2: Highlight the Prevalence of Online Abuse Data gathered from multiple sources suggest that online harassment and abuse have become a significant issue. In fact, a 2017 study by the Pew Research Center found that 41% of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment. With the increasing reliance on digital platforms for communication, work, and learning, cyberbullying and targeted harassment have only continued to rise. Step 3: Explain the Need for a Review of Laws Cases of online abuse have become increasingly prominent, and many argue that current legal frameworks have failed to keep up with this evolving problem. To make matters worse, many victims are hesitant to report incidents due to the fear of further harassment or victim blaming. Miller's call for an urgent review of laws emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive approach to addressing online abuse. Step 4: Detail the Desired Outcomes of the Legal Review The aim of the legal review should be twofold: to ensure that existing legislation is effective in the digital age, and to develop new policies to address emerging challenges and forms of online abuse. Creating more precise definitions of online abuse and establishing clear guidelines for reporting and handling cases can pave the way for a more effective response to this issue. Additionally, this legal review should involve collaboration between government, law enforcement, and tech companies in order to create a more wholesome approach to combat cyberbullying and harassment. Step 5: Address Possible Objections and Challenges Some critics may argue that a law review could potentially infringe upon free speech rights or lead to increased surveillance over citizen's internet usage. However, it is crucial to emphasize that the goal of this review is to protect individuals from targeted, harmful behavior without compromising their freedom of expression. Striking a balance between protecting users' safety and maintaining their rights requires careful deliberation to ensure an equitable solution. Conclusion: Maria Miller's call for an urgent review of the laws surrounding the increasingly pressing problem of online abuse highlights the need for a more proactive and robust legal framework. Tackling the issue requires not only reviewing current laws but also engaging in a collaborative effort with various stakeholders. As we continue to embrace digital environments in every aspect of our lives, it is our collective responsibility to create a safer and more equitable online world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

O'Donnell designed the opening to lull the listener into a sense of suspense, then wonder; \\"I want them to feel pride and longing the moment Master Chief walks out of the smoke.\\" he said. \\"I want them to be left with that, 'I can hardly wait to play this game' feeling\\". Another reworked theme from Halo was used as the background music for the Halo 3 E3 2007 trailer; O'Donnell later offered this track for free online.In addition to the music composed by O'Donnell and Salvatori, the announcement of the Halo 3 Soundtrack was followed with a call for entries to all artists or bands to submit their own original song to be included on the final CD. The submissions were judged by O'Donnell, producer Nile Rodgers, and other artists including Steve Vai. Rodgers stated that more than 21,000 songs were entered, and at least 30% were \\"amazing\\"; the winner was Greg Haupt and his band Princeton, whose song \\"LvUrFR3NZ\\" appears as the final track on the...

Based on the premise \\"come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Come by at any time and knock on the door and we'll hand you the recycling.\\" is true?","completion":"To determine the truth of the hypothesis \\"Come by at any time and knock on the door and we'll hand you the recycling,\\" based on the premise \\"come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb,\\" we should closely examine the information provided in the premise, and compare it with the hypothesis. The premise states that: 1. The event takes place on a specific day: the regular garbage day. 2. The recycling is kept outside at the curb. 3. The action involves picking up the recycling. The hypothesis states that: 1. The event can occur at any time. 2. The recycling is handed over after knocking on the door. 3. The action involves handing over the recycling. Upon comparing the two statements, it's evident that the premise and the hypothesis differ in terms of the day and timing of the task, as well as the method of transferring the recycling. The following differences can be noted: 1. The premise specifies a particular day (the regular garbage day) for the task to be carried out, while the hypothesis suggests that the task can be executed at any time. 2. In the premise, there is no interaction with the homeowner, as the recycling is simply picked up from the curb by the garbage collection service. On the other hand, in the hypothesis, the homeowner is more actively involved in the process, as they hand over the recycling to the person knocking on their door. 3. The recycling pick-up location differs in both instances. In the premise, the recycling is placed outside at the curb, whereas in the hypothesis, the recycling is handed over indoors after the service provider knocks on the door. Based on these discrepancies, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Come by at any time and knock on the door and we'll hand you the recycling\\" is true, given the premise \\"come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb.\\" The actions and conditions suggested by the hypothesis are not consistent with or supported by the information provided in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that said Solti is tense at rehearsals? is inside the article: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Summarize the following: Engaging manual mode on your garage door while it’s open may cause it to come crashing closed if the door spring is damaged. Avoid this by setting it to manual mode while the door is closed. If this is impossible because the door is stuck open, move on to the next step. Use 2x4s that are as high as the garage door opening. If you don't have 2x4s that will fit the opening, you can improvise by placing a sturdy item like a shelf in its place. Use a hammer to tap the planks in between the door and the floor on each side of the garage door opening. Using something sturdy to prop up the door will prevent it from slamming shut, even if the garage door spring is damaged. The manual release cord is usually red and located next to the garage door motor. Pull down on this cord to disconnect the trolley from the automatic opening system. Pulling the cord will allow you to manually open and close your garage door. Have someone help you as you manually close the door. Remove the 2x4s by tapping them out with a hammer as someone holds the handle on the door. Once the 2x4s are removed, slowly and carefully lower the garage door to the closed position. Prevent the manual release cord from getting caught on the garage door tracks by pulling it down and towards the motor when you’re opening the door. If you have trouble doing this yourself, ask someone for help. If you want to set the garage door back to automatic mode, you'll need to pull the manual release cord towards the door opening while simultaneously opening the door. Doing this should reconnect the trolley to the automatic opening system and allow you to automatically open and close the door with the button again.","completion":"In order to prevent potential damage to your garage door when it's open, it's important to engage the manual mode while the door is closed. If it's not possible to do so because the door is stuck open, follow these steps to ensure safety and avoid any accidents. 1. Obtain 2x4s that are as tall as your garage door opening. If you don't have suitable 2x4s, you can use any sturdy object, like a shelf, as a replacement. These items will be used to support the garage door while it's in manual mode. 2. Use a hammer to insert the 2x4s or other sturdy objects between the garage door and the floor on both sides of the door opening. This will keep the door from slamming shut in case the door spring is damaged. 3. Locate the manual release cord, which is typically red and found near the garage door motor. By pulling down on this cord, you will disconnect the trolley from the automatic opening system, allowing you to manually control the door. 4. Ask someone to assist you in manually closing the garage door while you remove the 2x4s or other supports. Carefully tap them out with a hammer as your helper holds the door handle. 5. Once the supports are removed, slowly lower the door to its closed position. 6. To prevent the manual release cord from getting caught in the door tracks, pull it down and towards the motor as you open the door. Seek assistance if you have trouble with this step. 7. To return the garage door to automatic mode, pull the manual release cord towards the opening while simultaneously opening the door. This will reconnect the trolley to the automatic system, allowing you to open and close the door with the remote control once more.

Paragraph: On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits.

In England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300, and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million. By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided, but it never really died out in England. Over the next few hundred years, further outbreaks occurred in 1361–1362, 1369, 1379–1383, 1389–1393, and throughout the first half of the 15th century. An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479–1480 could have been as high as 20%. The most general outbreaks in Tudor dynasty and House of Stuart England seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636, and ended with the Great Plague of London in 1665.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A Nobel Prize is considered by most people one of the highest international honours a person can receive. As you know, the prizes were started by a Swede called Alfred Nobel. He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of 9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace. The first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements. Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about 40,000. Often a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement. In 1972, for example, no Nobel Peace Prize was given. A:","completion":"Which of the following statements is true about the Nobel Prize? A) It is awarded only to citizens of Sweden.

Article: SHANGHAI - Health experts in Shanghai are calling for more protection for young children as the latest research shows about half of the youngsters are suffering from secondhand smoke. About 45 percent of children suffer passive smoking in families, 50 percent in public places, and almost 6 percent on public transportation, shows a research released by the Shanghai Children's Medical Center on Tuesday. \\"Not only adults but also children and newborn babies are at risk for the adverse effects of passive smoking,\\" said Tang Jingyan, a doctor at the Shanghai Children's Medical Center. \\"Actually, those young children whose bodies are still growing and developing are more sensitive to the effects of secondhand smoke.\\" Research has shown that children who are exposed to secondhand smoke will suffer from more colds, coughs and sore throats, and they are more likely to suffer from bronchitis, pneumonia and will have a higher risk of developing cancer. Doctors even suggested that children suffering passive smoking are more likely to have behavioral problems and may not develop mentally as quickly as their peers. Other research by the Shanghai Children's Medical Center has found that more than 80 percent of child patients in the center live in a smoke-filled household, where one or both parents smoke. \\"Though doctors have stressed the harm of passive smoking over and over, it is still hard to reach a totally 'smoke free' home,\\" said a pediatrician named Zhang Yiwen, noting that parents are often tempted to smoke even though they have learned the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. China has 540 million people suffering from passive smoke, 180 million of them younger than 15.The age of smokers is also getting lower, earlier reports said. \\"There are more young smokers than before.You can see young people wearing a school uniform and carrying a schoolbag light a cigarette on the street.Some of them are even female students,\\" said Jing Xingming, a professor of children's developmental behavior at the center. \\"Children like...

In the cosmic scheme of things, this was relatively minor. But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet.

She viciously insults him and his parents, angering Harry who unwittingly uses his innate magical powers to cause her to inflate, and float off, out of the Dursleys' house and into the twilight. Harry flees the Dursleys' home, furious. At first he walks with determination but soon grinds to a stop as he realizes he hasn't anywhere to go. He sits down at the edge of the road with his trunk. His surroundings stir as the wind picks up and a street lamp flickers above him. A jet black dog emerges from the bushes opposite, growling at him and he raises his wand.

While there, Harry learns that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), an alleged supporter of Lord Voldemort, the dark wizard, has escaped from Azkaban prison. Harry must meet the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) and he fears expulsion from Hogwarts for his using of under-age magic out of school.

Article:","completion":"Title: Cool and Clean Mud Baths for Elephants! Do you know what elephants love to do to keep cool and clean? They love taking mud baths! But what is a mud bath, and why do elephants love it so much? Let's find out! First, let's talk about why mud baths are important for elephants. Just like how people can feel really hot on a sunny day, elephants feel that too. To stay cool, they cover themselves in mud. The mud acts like a nice, cool coat that protects them from the heat. Not only do mud baths help elephants feel cool, but they also help them stay clean. You may think that getting covered in mud would make them dirty, but it actually helps them stay free from tiny unwanted critters called parasites. Parasites are little bugs that can make animals feel itchy and uncomfortable. By rolling in mud, the elephants protect themselves from these bugs because the mud sticks to their skin and creates a barrier that keeps them away. Some elephants like to take a 'dust bath' after having a morning bathe. This is a part of their daily routine, just like how you might brush your teeth every morning. A nice photo-taker named Peter Delaney followed some elephants for a week to take pictures of them enjoying their mud baths. He spent lots of time watching these wonderful creatures as they splashed around in the mud.

It conveys the speaker's instruction or request for the listener not to behave in a silly or ludicrous manner. 3. Pragmatics: The sentence functions as a directive, which is a speech act aiming to guide the listener's behavior.

The tweet reads: \\"Horrible .. im super sick .. you ?\\" Breaking down the tweet content, we can observe that the user (@KardiSmacks) is expressing strong negative feelings.

Additionally, the user then explicitly mentions being \\"super sick,\\" which again conveys a negative emotion. The use of the word \\"super\\" as an adjective intensifies the severity of their illness, further emphasizing that the sentiment is indeed negative. Nobody wants to be sick, and illness typically results in discomfort, pain, or suffering. As the user also asks a question at the end - \\"you?\\" - it might indicate that they want to know how the person they are conversing with is feeling.

Paper Pressing the sheet removes the water by force; once the water is forced from the sheet, a special kind of felt, which is not to be confused with the traditional one, is used to collect the water; whereas when making paper by hand, a blotter sheet is used instead. Q: How is the water removed by force from a sheet of paper?","completion":"Step 1: Prepare the materials: To remove water from a sheet of paper, you will need a sheet of wet paper, a flat surface, a special felt (or a blotter sheet for handmade paper), and a heavy object or roller. Step 2: Place the wet paper sheet on the flat surface: Lay the wet sheet of paper flat on a clean, flat surface, ensuring there are no folds or creases. Step 3: Put the special felt or blotter sheet on top of the wet paper: Carefully place the special felt or blotter sheet on top of the wet paper, making sure it covers the entire sheet. The purpose of the felt or blotter sheet is to absorb water and also facilitate even distribution of pressure on the paper. Step 4: Apply pressure using a heavy object or roller: In this step, the water is removed by force. Place a heavy object, such as a large book, evenly across the felt or blotter sheet. Alternatively, use a roller to firmly press down on the paper, starting from the center and moving outwards. The force applied will squeeze the water out of the paper and into the felt or blotter sheet. Step 5: Check the paper: After applying pressure, carefully lift the heavy object or stop rolling and gently peel back the felt or blotter sheet to check the paper. If necessary, repeat the process using a fresh felt or blotter sheet until the paper is adequately dry. Step 6: Final drying: Allow the paper to air dry completely before using it. This can be done by hanging the paper on a clothesline or laying it on a flat surface. In summary, the water is removed from a sheet of paper by force through a process of evenly applying pressure using a heavy object or roller, which forces water out of the sheet and into a specially designed felt or blotter sheet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Carr was born Joseph Francis Karr on October 23, 1879, at his parents' home in the Irish neighborhood on the East End of Columbus, Ohio. His father, Michael Karr, was a shoemaker who was born in Ireland in 1841 and immigrated to the United States in 1864. His mother Margaret Karr was born in New York to Irish immigrant parents. Carr had five older siblings, Bridget, James, John, Mary, and Michael, and a younger brother, Edward. In 1900, Carr organized a baseball team made up of employees of the railroad's Panhandle Division. The team, known as the Famous Panhandle White Sox, played in the Capital City League and the Saturday Afternoon League in Columbus for several years. According to the Chicago Tribune, Carr's Panhandle club \\"gained a reputation in semi-professional ranks throughout the country.\\" In 1907, Carr began a long association with the sport of football. He obtained permission from the Panhandle Athletic Club to reorganize the Columbus Panhandles football team, a team that had been formed in 1900 or 1901 and disbanded in 1904. He secured players from the railroad shop where he worked. The core of Carr's Panhandles teams were six Nesser brothers who worked at the shop and were excellent athletes. To save on expenses, the players, who were railroad employees, used their passes to ride the train for free and practiced during the lunch hour on the railroad yards. Over the next 13 years, the Panhandles became known as a traveling team, as Carr saved money on travel expenses and stadium rental by playing mostly road games. In 1921, the Fort Wayne Journal called the Panhandles the \\"most renowned professional football aggregation in the country.\\" Carr also continued his association with professional baseball while running the Panhandles, serving for several years as the secretary/treasurer and later president of the Ohio State League, a minor league baseball circuit. As early as 1917, Carr was one of the leading advocates of a plan to develop a national professional football league. Sources are not in agreement as to what role, if any, he played in the formation of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which later became the National Football League (NFL). However, once the APFA was formed in 1920, Carr's Panhandles played in the league's inaugural season. The 1920 Panhandles team played only one home game and compiled a 2-7-2 record. How did the inaugural season go?","completion":"The inaugural season of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which later became the National Football League (NFL), took place in 1920.

Overall, the season was not very successful for the Panhandles, as they struggled to make a significant impact in the league standings. However, the fact that the team participated in the first-ever season of the APFA marked an important milestone in their history and the development of professional football in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Who are you talking to?\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Why aren't you talking?\\" true?","completion":"In order to assess the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, we must first examine the content and context of each statement: Premise: \\"Who are you talking to?\\" The premise poses a question about the identity of the person (or AI) the conversation participant is engaging with. It implies that someone is actively talking or communicating, and the speaker asking the question wants to know the identity of the recipient of the communication. Hypothesis: \\"Why aren't you talking?\\" The hypothesis, on the other hand, appears to question the lack of communication from someone—one might infer that this question is directed towards someone who is not currently engaging in conversation. It juxtaposes the initial premise, as it assumes the opposite state; that someone is not talking when they could or should be. To determine whether the hypothesis, \\"Why aren't you talking?\\", maybe considered true based on the premise, \\"Who are you talking to?\\", we need to evaluate whether these two statements are congruent. If congruent, it could lead to the interpretation that the hypothesis is true or supportable. Upon analysis, we observe that the premise and the hypothesis contradict each other. The premise assumes that someone is currently talking and directs the question towards the identity of the person (or AI) being spoken with. On the other hand, the hypothesis questions a lack of communication and assumes that someone is not talking when they are expected to be. As the two statements are at odds with each other, it is not possible to conclude that the hypothesis, \\"Why aren't you talking?\\", is true based on the premise, \\"Who are you talking to?\\" The premise and the hypothesis convey opposing scenarios, making it impossible to infer or support the hypothesis based on the premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Justin Bieber Is Right to Fight Silly \\"Sorry\\" Copyright Lawsuit I’m no Justin Bieber fan. Heck, I even signed that petition a few years back to have the White House deport the Biebs because he is a cultural nuisance. But when it comes to this copyright lawsuit, we should all have his back. News of the lawsuit emerged last Friday. It concerns an indie singer named White Hinderland, who claims Bieber and his producer Skrillex ripped off a vocal sequence for the smash hit “Sorry.” The disputed vocal sequence comes at the very opening of “Sorry” during which Bieber coos something like “ah, ooo–ooo–ooo.” Hinterland (or, more precisely, her lawyer) says the refrain is the same as one in her song “Ring the Bell,” and that Bieber’s “wrongful conduct has deprived Plaintiff of the benefit of her exclusive right to … her copyrighted works.” The singer is now asking a Tennessee court to order Bieber and his gang to pay damages, and for an injunction barring them from using that piece of music. Bieber, to his credit, is having none of it. The Canadian star on Friday tweeted a video showing how he produced the vocals, and suggesting he did not infringe Hinterland’s copyright: Others have since taken to YouTube to compare the two pieces. (This clip, which suggests the opening of “Sorry” was crafted from Bieber’s own voice, is worth a look since it shows a technical construction of the two songs.) Hinterland’s lawyer, meanwhile, will no doubt counter by pointing to a musicologist’s report, cited in the lawsuit, that says the pieces of music are the same. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. But whatever’s going on, let’s hope Bieber fights this in court since these types of cases are ridiculous—and bad for copyright and creativity. Let’s start with where this case was filed: the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. As a lawyer writing at J.D. Supra notes, this choice of venue is no coincidence. It lies in the the 6th Circuit, which has issued a series of infamous copyright rulings in the past that effectively banned sampling and, in the process, nearly destroyed hip-hop. This venue shopping is just one aspect of a cynical business model in which trolling copyright lawyers use technology to discover similarities between pieces of music, and then embark on a sort of shakedown. As Charles Cronin, a copyright authority at the University of Southern California, told the Fashion Law Blog in relation to the Bieber case: “Music infringement claims tend to be settled early on, with financially successful defendants doling out basically extorted payoffs to potential plaintiffs rather than facing expensive, protracted and embarrassing litigation.” Does this mean anyone should be able to help themselves to an artist’s work without permission? No, of course not. But it’s also absurd to require every musician to call a lawyer when they want to use a few seconds of sound. These sort of rules don’t encourage creativity, which copyright is supposed to do, but instead suppress it by taking away basic building blocks of art. It’s like telling a writer she can’t use the phrase “once upon a time” or a painter he can’t use a type of brush stroke. Fortunately, copyright law has some safety valves in the form of the “De Minimis” doctrine and “fair use” that can stop some of this silliness. Let’s hope Bieber takes up one these or another defense, and makes White Hinterland and her lawyer “sorry” they sued in the first place. Summary:","completion":"There is a news article about Justin Bieber and a singer named White Hinderland. White Hinderland is saying that Justin Bieber and his producer took a part of her song \\"Ring the Bell\\" and used it without permission in Justin Bieber's song \\"Sorry.\\" Now, she wants Justin Bieber to pay her money and stop using that part of her song. But Justin Bieber doesn't agree, so they might go to court. The article believes that these kind of cases are not good for music and creativity and hopes that Justin Bieber can make a strong case against it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: HHS has requested emergency review of the collections because the collection of the information is needed before the expiration of the normal time limits of the act to assure guaranteeing availability of individual health insurance coverage to certain individuals with prior group coverage. Sentence 2: HHS has denied emergency review of the collections because it is unimportant. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In fact, the two sentences express opposing ideas. In the first sentence, it is mentioned that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has requested an emergency review concerning the collection of information regarding the availability of individual health insurance coverage for certain individuals with prior group coverage. This request implies that the HHS believes the matter to be important and urgent, deserving attention before the expiration of the normal time limits of the relevant act. On the other hand, the second sentence states that the HHS has denied the emergency review, describing the collection of information as unimportant. This sentence contradicts the first, as it claims that the HHS does not consider the matter significant or requiring urgent attention.

Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single \\"This Woman's Work\\". In 1988, the song \\"This Woman's Work\\" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World. The song has since appeared on television shows, and in 2005 reached number-eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film Dinosaur, but the track was not included on the soundtrack. According to the winter 1999 issue of HomeGround, a Bush fanzine, it was scrapped when Disney asked her to rewrite the song and she refused. Also in 1999, Bush's song \\"The Sensual World\\" was featured prominently in Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan's film \\"Felicia's Journey\\".In 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for The Golden Compass soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, Lyra Belacqua. The song, \\"Lyra\\", was used in the closing credits of the film, reached number 187 in the UK Singles Chart and was nominated for the International Press Academy's Satellite Award for original song in a motion picture.

The sentence successfully conveys a comparison between the speeds of Mary and John. Let's break down the sentence to understand its components and anatomize its structure. 1. Subject: \\"Mary\\" - In this sentence, the subject is \\"Mary,\\" a proper noun representing the first person being compared. 2. Predicate: \\"is faster than John is\\" - The predicate of the sentence conveys what the subject does, feels, or is. In this case, it comprises a comparative structure expressing that Mary's speed is greater than that of John. 3. Comparative adjective: \\"faster\\" - The main component of a comparative sentence is the comparative form of an adjective, which in this case is \\"faster.\\" This word is derived from the adjective \\"fast\\" and is used to compare the speeds of Mary and John. 4. Comparison: \\"than\\" - The word \\"than\\" serves as the connector for the comparative structure, highlighting the relationship between the two compared elements (Mary and John). 5. Second subject: \\"John\\" - In a comparative sentence, there usually are two subjects being compared. \\"John\\" is the second subject, also a proper noun, representing the person being compared against Mary. 6. Auxiliary verb: \\"is\\" - The auxiliary verb \\"is,\\" a form of the verb \\"to be,\\" is repeated at the end of the sentence. It provides parallelism to the sentence and emphasizes the comparison between Mary and John. While not absolutely necessary for the sentence to be grammatically correct (i.e., \\"Mary is faster than John.\\"), its inclusion adds to the sentence's clarity and cohesion. Based on the analysis and breakdown of the sentence structure, it is evident that \\"Mary is faster than John is.\\" is grammatically correct and an acceptable English sentence.

What is the most sensical answer between \\"Mercury\\" and \\"Venus\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"Mercury\\" and \\"Venus\\" is \\"Mercury.\\" In this short story, it is mentioned that Mercury has less mass than Venus, which implies that it has weaker gravity (Option A). Before we delve into the reasons why Mercury has weaker gravity, let's first understand a little about both planets' characteristics. Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of approximately 4,880 kilometers, while Venus is significantly larger, with a diameter of about 12,104 kilometers. Comparing their masses, Mercury has a mass of 3.3011 x 10^23 kg, while Venus's mass is 4.8675 x 10^24 kg. Gravity is directly proportional to an object's mass. The larger an object's mass, the greater the force of gravity it can exert. The force of gravity can be calculated using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, as follows: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 where F is the force of gravity, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. Given that Mercury has less mass than Venus, we can deduce that the force of gravity on its surface will be weaker than that on Venus's surface. Mercury's gravity is about 3.7 m/s² (0.38 times Earth's gravity), while Venus's gravity is around 8.9 m/s² (0.9 times Earth's gravity). Consequently, an object would weigh less on Mercury than it would on Venus. However, it is essential to note that the force of gravity is not the sole factor determining the strength of gravity experienced on a planet's surface. Other factors, such as the planet's size (diameter) and the distance from its center to its surface, can also influence the gravity we feel on the planet. In the case of Mercury and Venus, these factors still lead to the conclusion that the gravity on Mercury is weaker than that on Venus. In conclusion, the most sensical answer between \\"Mercury\\" and \\"Venus\\" is \\"Mercury.\\" The original statement provided – \\"Mercury has less mass than Venus so it has weaker gravity\\" – is accurate and well-reasoned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we should first understand the meaning of the terminologies involved and the context in which they are being used. The 'Sabbath' refers to a weekly day of rest, commonly observed by the Jewish faith from Friday evening to Saturday evening, and by some Christian denominations on Sundays. The term 'Passover' refers to the Jewish holiday that celebrates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. Premise: Closed Sabbath This statement informs us that a specific place, event, or establishment (which has not been mentioned) is closed on the Sabbath, either on Saturdays or Sundays, depending on the faith or belief system followed. Hypothesis: It's closed on the Sabbath and during Passover. This hypothesis builds upon the premise that the establishment is closed on the Sabbath and adds that it is also closed during the Passover holiday. Now, to analyze if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to check if the information in the premise is enough to logically conclude the hypothesis. The premise only states that the place is closed on the Sabbath. However, the hypothesis goes beyond this by including the fact that the place is also closed during Passover, which is not mentioned in the premise. Therefore, while the Sabbath portion of the hypothesis is supported by the premise, the Passover portion is additional information that is not entailed by the premise. We cannot conclusively say that the entire hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the information about Passover closure is not derived from or supported by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Diese Faktoren tragen dazu bei, dass der Kontinent für ausländische Unternehmen und Investoren immer interessanter wird. Gleichzeitig entwickeln sich jedoch auch Indien und China in hohem Tempo weiter. Beide Länder haben in den letzten Jahren beeindruckende Wachstumsraten verzeichnet, die ihre Volkswirtschaften zu den am schnellsten wachsenden der Welt gemacht haben. Dieses Wachstum ist auf verschiedene Faktoren zurückzuführen, wie zum Beispiel politische Stabilität, wirtschaftliche Reformen, Investitionen in Infrastruktur und Bildung sowie die rasante Entwicklung ihrer Technologieindustrie. Diese rasche Entwicklung hat dazu geführt, dass die Kluft zwischen Afrika und den aufstrebenden Wirtschaftsmächten Indien und China immer größer wird. Obwohl Afrika in vielen Bereichen Fortschritte macht, kann es mit der Innovationskraft und den Investitionen der beiden asiatischen Giganten einfach nicht mithalten. Das bedeutet, dass Afrika in den kommenden Jahren und Jahrzehnten vor großen Herausforderungen steht, wenn es darum geht, das wirtschaftliche Niveau dieser Länder zu erreichen. Um dies zu erreichen, müssten afrikanische Länder ihre eigenen Wirtschaftsreformen forcieren, investieren und die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit in verschiedenen Sektoren verbessern. Zudem müssen sie ihre Handelsbeziehungen sowohl regional als auch mit anderen aufstrebenden Wirtschaftsmächten ausbauen und stärken, um wirtschaftliche Vorteile zu erzielen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen gibt es auch viele Möglichkeiten für Afrika, um seine wirtschaftliche Position zu verbessern. Dazu gehört die Nutzung seiner reichen natürlichen Ressourcen, der Ausbau des industriellen Sektors, die Schaffung einer qualifizierten und gebildeten Bevölkerung durch Bildungsinvestitionen sowie die Stärkung von Demokratie und Rechtsstaatlichkeit, um politische Stabilität zu gewährleisten. Insgesamt muss Afrika sich darauf konzentrieren, seine eigenen Stärken zu nutzen, um den wirtschaftlichen Fortschritt der Länder weiter voranzutreiben.

St. Michaels University School student Ann Makosinski was the only Canadian among the four winners at Google's annual international science fair, beating out thousands of other young scientists from around the world. Winning the international contest was \\"a total shock\\", Ann said from San Francisco. \\"I definitely think it will have an influence on my future.\\" Ann thanked her family for encouraging her interest in science, telling the judges that her first toy was a box of transistors . Ann's prize includes a 25,000 scholarship and a \\"once-in-a-lifetime experience\\" from either the European Organization for Nuclear Research, Lego or Google for her Hollow Flashlight, which has no moving parts or batteries. Ann created the flashlight for a local science fair. The inspiration for the invention came from seeing unwanted batteries and after visits to the Philippines, where she saw the need for a battery-free flashlight. A friend at school there failed in her studies because of a lack of electricity and light to study when it became dark. In her project, Ann wrote that she \\"made two flashlights that do not use any batteries, harmful chemicals, or kinetic energy . They do not create any noise and will always work. The flashlight's only limitation is its need for at least a 5degC temperature difference to provide usable light.\\" A You Tube video of Ann explaining how she created the flashlight has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. Despite her success, the private school student is undecided about her career path. Ann hopes she can find a way to combine her love of film with science. The four winners were chosen from 15 finalists from eight countries. The contest attracted thousands of entries from students in 120 countries.

Article: If we have learned anything from Sunday school, it’s that God — the being that created the world in seven days — is quite the multitasker. Even tweens these days who can text, tweet, and read all four Twilight books at once have got nothin’ on him. But believe me, LeBron James, when I tell you that God is probably a bit too busy to have had a hand in last night’s NBA Finals, during which your faltering performance led to the Miami Heat’s loss to the Dallas Mavericks. That fact didn’t stop the NBA star, however, from pointing to God, tweeting last night, “The Greater Man upstairs know when it’s my time. Right now isn’t the time.” The Greater Man (or woman!) upstairs also knows that proper grammar is important. (But he/she does forgive, providing it’s a simple typo.) But while I’m willing to believe that God does take a time out from attempting to end world hunger, war, and Paris Hilton’s career every once in awhile to catch a sporting event, an American Idol finale, and a Mad Men episode (to admire his finest creations, of course), God shouldn’t be the scapegoat for a loss, since he’s likely a tad too busy with Europe’s debt crisis to determine the results of the NBA Final.

The Mavericks executed payback to perfection. Five years after losing NBA Finals Game 6 at home to Miami, the Mavs managed to return the favor. It was a total team effort for a franchise that has never gotten to stand atop of the NBA world's throne. All in all it's a feel good story for a team that many didn't expect to see playing into June. With the victory comes the realization of a dream for many veteran Dallas players, that may not have had another chance to win a title. \\"When you do something as crazy as I did you have to back it up.\\" Jason Terry said. Give Terry all the credit in the world. He came off the bench to outplay arguably the two best players in the NBA. Dirk Nowitzki has to be feeling blessed: for on a night when he was ice cold, it was his teammates that managed to pick up the slack. That was one of the best aspects of the Mavericks, they truly were the epitome of a team. At no point did anyone question if they would unravel. They steered through four series that people questioned if they could win. Not just did they steer through it, they came out shining bigger and brighter than any star in Texas. We will now take a look at the top 10 reasons Dallas won Game 6 and are now the champions of the NBA world. ||||| Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE/Getty Images LeBron James found a change of scenery, but finished the season with the same result. MIAMI -- The screams and laughs wafted into the interview room from the nearby Dallas Mavericks locker room, and LeBron James and Dwyane Wade couldn’t avoid having it wash over them. All around them were the sounds of celebration in their own building, salt in their wounds as similar cheers were raging across the country. Space, time, irony and remorse; these realities and emotions were crashing down on the Miami Heat. Everyone had a part in it. This defeat had many fathers. But no one felt the weight more than James. In this same space -- a couple feet away in fact -- where they were feeling their lowest, Wade, James and Chris Bosh had once boarded a hydraulic lift to announce their arrival in Miami to the world. A world that was so turned off by it that they stayed up late and had parties and jammed Facebook and Twitter with glee at the Mavs’ 105-95 vanquishing of the Heat in Game 6 of the NBA Finals on Sunday night. “Sometimes you got it, sometimes you don’t,” James told the media. “The Greater Man upstairs know [sic] when it's my time. Right now isn't the time,” James told his Twitter followers a few minutes later. That time. Yes, time is now all James has and it’s going to be hard time, too. With the start of next season in doubt because of labor issues and no free agency to distract the basketball world he lives in from another late-season personal collapse, there’s no redemption on the horizon. Then there’s the irony. The Heat lost to the Mavs, whose owner Mark Cuban was so enraged that James, then a free agent, wouldn’t even grant his franchise a meeting last summer that he called for an investigation into how James, Wade and Chris Bosh all came to the decision to shift the NBA’s balance of power. Now the same man was carrying the Larry O’Brien Trophy right out of their building. “I could care less about the Heat, that’s their problem,” Cuban said with the bravado of a man who was tasting revenge and vindication in the same moment. “They did their thing, we did ours.” On to the remorse. This will be the toughest one because it’s a burden James, and his teammates too, will have to endure alone. The grisly statistics will dog him forever, even if he’s able to enjoy supreme success in the future. The film will chase his legacy too, the unexplainable possessions in which he looked lost and unsure of his talents. The whole quarters when his usually fantastic play was inexplicably missing. In Game 6, James scored nine points in the first few minutes, looking to all like he was finally showing some mettle before it was too late. Then he went 36 minutes while scoring just five more points, throwing odd passes, deferring and looking passive all over again. By the fourth quarter it was too late. He’d actually made a few baskets -- scoring seven points -- which qualified for his best fourth quarter of a series in which he had vanished so glaringly that people were asking about injuries and making up rumors to make their minds fit what their eyes were seeing. Just like last season in Cleveland where James' performance in the clutch was the polar opposite of what his talent and history called for. Just like when the top-seeded Cavs got behind the Celtics, as soon as the Mavs turned the tables on the Heat midway through this series James' swagger and game left him. When the Heat were beating the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls, series they took control of early, James was a brilliant frontrunner. At his best, really, finishing those teams off. It was now when he was expected to rediscover that dominance with anger and motivation from the Mavs and the masses. Everyone around him thought so, too. They talked to him about it, they encouraged him, they expected it. Even his biggest detractors and critics knew it could happen. They qualified and tempered their lashings over the past two weeks expecting James to answer at some point. But as he went through another puzzling game Sunday -- dishing repeatedly to Juwan Howard at the rim instead of taking the ball to the basket himself, passing up wide-open shots when the ball came his way, standing and watching on defense like it was a summer camp drill at times -- it got more and more clear. James couldn’t do it. So fitting was the moment in the fourth quarter when the Heat were trying to cobble together a comeback and Mario Chalmers and James found themselves on a break together. James called for the ball. Chalmers saw him but kept it, trying to beat two Mavs players by himself. It was a brash play by a headstrong and fearless player that was wrong, but it was also a glaring indication of where James’ teammates apparently thought he was by then. Chalmers felt like he could do it better by himself. James finished with 21 points, the most on the Heat, on what looks like a wonderful 9-of-15 shooting performance. It was, in fact, a better game than Wade's; he shot 6-of-16 and had just 17 points. But Wade’s game had so much more will and passion. He was blazing across the floor trying to carry the Heat through it. In the coming weeks, Wade’s heartache will be as intense as his teammates'. But while it’ll be fair to cry over his execution, his drive was unquestioned and he goes to sleep every night knowing he’s still a champion. His mistakes, and there were plenty, came from aggression and the desire not to lose. So were Chalmers’, who had 18 points, seven assists and three steals. And Udonis Haslem's, who had 11 points and nine rebounds on a foot that still isn’t totally healed. Bosh, too. He didn’t rise to the level of counterpart Dirk Nowitzki, true. No one could. But Bosh acquitted himself better in these playoffs than perhaps anyone on the Heat team. He finished Game 6 with 19 points and eight rebounds. All of them played like their playoff lives were on the line Sunday night. James, again, played much of it like he was stuck in a bad dream. After James’ Game 4, when he scored eight points in a game that truly turned the tide in the series after he was unable to impact the outcome when the Heat were just a big play or two away from grabbing a 3-1 series lead, the demand for James to respond was immense. A marginal improvement would not do. He needed to roar back because of his talent and those fresh memories from the past two rounds. Of course, he did not. More chilling, it looked like he could not. For those who cursed him when he signed with the Heat last summer -- be it fans of the teams he spurned or those turned off by the nature of his announcement -- it was like Christmas. Even buried in the bubble of friends and family he’s crafted over the years to protect him, he knew it and heard it as clearly as those Mavs players, coaches and officials cracking open Budweisers down the hall. Left threadbare, all James could do was deploy his defense mechanisms. “All the people that were rooting me on to fail, at the end of the day they have to wake up tomorrow and have the same life they had before,” James said. “They have the same personal problems they had today. I’m going to continue to live the way I want to live and continue to do the things that I want with me and my family and be happy with that.” Yes, James could leave in his Bentley or Rolls Royce or Maybach or whatever vehicle he chose to drive. He could, indeed, go home to his mansion where his personal chef might have a five-star meal waiting. Then off to his plush bed with 1,500-thread-count sheets. In a few days, it’ll be off on a private jet for a needed vacation. The vast majority of those who toasted his defeat will wake up and go to work on Monday morning. James is a multimillionaire now and he’ll still be a multimillionaire after the coming lockout ends. As a two-time MVP, he's earned it. All these things will provide him plenty of comfort while his performance is eviscerated nationally. “They can get a few days or a few months or whatever the case may be on being happy that not only myself, but the Miami Heat not accomplishing their goal,” James said. “But they’ll have to get back to the real world at some point.” And there’s the rub. So, too, will James. Eight years in, James is walking away from another season with no ring. In the past he could -- and did -- with his head high while quietly blame others. Last year, he got away with a series in which he failed to deliver. Now, in the real world, there’s nowhere to hide. |||||Summary:","completion":"In this article, the author discusses LeBron James' tweet attributing his faltering performance during the NBA Finals game between the Miami Heat and the Dallas Mavericks to God's timing.

If you're looking at a tree in the shape of a bear, it's a topiary . A topiary is a tree or bush that is trained into a shape. Growing a topiary garden takes both time and skills. A topiary gardener should make a drawing first. The drawing shows the final shape that the gardener likes. The gardener then chooses a bush for the topiary. It may be one that just planted or one that is already in place. In June of the plant's first year, the gardener looks for new leaves. When the leaves grow, it's time to shape the bottom of the bush. It needs about five years. The top is not _ during this time. In the fifth year, the bush grows tall enough for shaping. Then the gardener begins to shape the whole bush. Once a topiary has been started, it needs care all year. In the summer it must be cut many times to keep its shape. This cutting also helps the bush grow. In the winter the bushes don't grow. The gardeners have to brush snow off the plants, or snow may hurt some parts of them. Topiary gardening is a very old art. The Romans did it in the first century. In the sixteenth century, people in Europe liked topiaries too. By the late 1600s, topiaries were also grown in America. Today it's popular in many parts of the world.

In this context, \\"lift\\" is a colloquial term often used in British English that refers to the act of providing someone a ride in a vehicle to a certain destination. In American English, the equivalent term is typically \\"ride.\\" In both sentences, the speaker is expressing that they were given transportation by someone else to a specific location. In the first sentence, \\"He gave me a lift to the bus station,\\" the speaker is saying that someone transported them to the bus station in a vehicle. Perhaps the speaker didn't have his or her own means of transportation, or the bus station was on the way to where the person giving the lift was heading. It could have been a friend, family member, or even perhaps a helpful stranger. In the second sentence, \\"He gave me a lift home,\\" the speaker is saying that someone transported them to their house or place of dwelling. Similar to the first sentence, the speaker might not have had their own transportation or didn't want to use public transportation. Perhaps it was too late at night for public transportation, or the speaker was carrying heavy items that made it impractical.

Select from the following. (1). yes; (2). no;","completion":"(1). Yes. The name \\"Sovdepia\\" was indeed used by people opposed to the Bolsheviks to mock the Soviet state, which was officially known as the \\"Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies.\\" This derogatory term emerged as a response to the revolution and establishment of the Soviet regime, illustrating the stark divide between the supporters of the Bolsheviks and those who resented their reign. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, came to power during the October Revolution in 1917, overthrowing the Provisional Government that had been in place since the earlier February Revolution. The revolution ushered in a new era marked by socialism and a swift departure from the previous tsarist system. The Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies were councils formed as part of Lenin's plan to shift control from the traditional governing structures to the proletariat. \\"Sovdepia\\" was coined by anti-Bolsheviks as a way to belittle the newly formed state and the ideals it represented. These critics were often comprised of monarchists longing for a return to the pre-revolutionary order, as well as other groups that felt disillusioned by the Bolshevik regime, such as some socialists and liberals. These factions did not support the establishment of a socialist state by the Bolsheviks, which they perceived as either impractical, repressive, or a betrayal of the initial goals of the 1917 revolution.

Which student learned less about ants that manage large herds of aphids ? Hannah and Joe are two colleagues. They both study horticulture. They've been studying ants lately for their entomology class. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus. Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.

In addition, the user also airs grievances about driving tests by referring to them as a 'joke.' The heart symbol <3 is usually used to express love or likability. Step 2: Analyzing sentiment Now based on above information, the sentiment in the first part of the tweet could be construed as negative because the user mentions feeling bored which is generally associated with frustration or discontent. In the second part, the user seems to be expressing dissatisfaction or exasperation with driving tests. This sentiment is also negative. Finally, the heart symbol, which usually signifies positive emotions, may contradict the overall negative tone here if it's used genuinely, but if it's used sarcastically, it reinforces the general negativity. Step 3: Sentiment prediction If we take into account the collective sentiments expressed in parts of this tweet, we would infer that the sentiment of this tweet is negative. The 'bored' emotion, complaining about the uncertainty of things looking up, and calling driving tests a 'joke' all contribute to this sentiment. The heart symbol doesn't seem to balance out the above negative sentiments and may even be reinforcing them if used sarcastically. Therefore, the overall sentiment of this tweet is negative.

Article: Republican lawmakers reaffirmed Wednesday their embrace of a controversial Medicare overhaul despite an electoral setback, ensuring the federal health program will remain a divisive issue through the 2012 election. House Republicans moved forward with Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to overhaul Medicare, and aim to reinvigorate the budget with a plan that would lower corporate taxes and boost jobs. WSJ's Jerry Seib has details. (AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps) Republicans responded to Democrat Kathy Hochul's Tuesday victory in a traditionally Republican New York Congressional district by saying they needed to attack the Democrats' Medicare position more forcefully, rather than back off their own plan. \\"We need to make it a choice between a do-nothing approach that will ultimately destroy Medicare, and life-saving reforms,\\" said Rep. Tom Cole (R., Okla.). Added Rep. Cliff Stearns (R., Fla.): \\"It's a wake-up call on how you frame it. It obviously wasn't framed right.\\" Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), who authored the Medicare plan, said Democratic attacks on his plan were effective in Tuesday's election to fill an open House seat near Buffalo. \\"They are shamelessly demagoguing and distorting it,\\" Mr. Ryan said, adding that Republicans would have a better chance to make their case over the next 18 months. Democrats said Republicans were kidding themselves if they failed to read the election as a signal that voters dislike the GOP plan. Under Mr. Ryan's proposal, passed last month by the Republican-led House, Medicare would become a system of private insurance plans, backed by government subsidies, for people now younger than 55. \\"If the Republicans truly believe that Medicare was not a factor in this race and they want to double down on their plan to end Medicare, they proceed at their own peril,\\" said Rep. Steve Israel (D., N.Y.), who coordinates Democratic House campaigns. Democrat Kathy Hochul defeated Republican Jane Corwin in a closely watched House race in western New York State. The race gained national attention when Corwin announced she favored an overhaul of Medicare. (AP Photo/Harry Scull Jr/The Buffalo News) The most immediate impact of the New York election could come in bipartisan talks on cutting the nation's 14.3 trillion debt. White House officials quickly used the results to argue that Republicans should agree to raise revenues as part of a deficit-reduction deal. Doing otherwise would require unacceptable cuts to safety-net programs, they argued. GOP leaders so far have flatly rejected tax increases. \\"I want to point out how isolated the House Republicans are,\\" said Gene Sperling, director of President Barack Obama's National Economic Council, at a conference on fiscal issues. \\"Serious people doing serious discussions do not take an absolutist position that you cannot have a penny of revenue.\\" Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who earlier in the week announced he wouldn't seek the Republican presidential nomination, defended the Ryan plan. But he also bolstered the White House point by saying Congress should consider raising revenue by eliminating certain tax breaks. One prominent Democrat, former President Bill Clinton, cautioned his party to remain open to safety-net program changes, rather than reading Tuesday's election as a signal to back away. \\"People made the judgment that the proposal in the Republican budget is not the right one,\\" Mr. Clinton said. \\"But I'm afraid that Democrats will draw the conclusion that because Congressman Ryan's proposal is not the best one, we shouldn't do anything. I completely disagree with that.\\" Senate Republicans showed their support for Mr. Ryan during a vote late Wednesday on his complete budget plan, which includes the Medicare proposal. The only GOP defections were Sens. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Mr. Paul said Mr. Ryan's budget didn't do enough to curb the national debt. The budget was rejected 57-40, with no Democrats voting for it. The Senate followed that up by rejecting President Obama's budget in a 97-0 vote. That budget has been essentially superseded by a recent speech Mr. Obama gave on deficit-reduction, though that speech didn't contain the detailed figures that make up a budget. Enlarge Image Close Associated Press Democratic candidate Kathy Hochul, left, talks with Debra Norton during a campaign stop at a restaurant in Amherst, N.Y., Tuesday. Ms. Hochul, the Erie County clerk, defeated Republican Jane Corwin and third-party candidate Jack Davis by relentlessly attacking Mr. Ryan's plan and linking it to Ms. Corwin. Ms. Hochul carried 47% of the vote, to 43% for Ms. Corwin, a state assembly member, and 9% for Mr. Davis. Republicans argued that Mr. Davis' presence complicated the race, and cautioned against reading too much into it. Still, many Republicans conceded that the Medicare issues had at least some effect on the race. All but four Republicans had supported Mr. Ryan's budget when the House approved it last month. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who entered the presidential race this week, said his own plan to bolster Medicare's finances would let seniors choose between the current program and other options. By contrast, Mr. Ryan would shift everyone currently younger than 55 into the new system of government-subsidized health insurance plans. Mr. Pawlenty was careful to praise Mr. Ryan for \\"leadership and courage,\\" contrasting with what he said was as a lack of leadership from Mr. Obama. The Republican embrace of Mr. Ryan's plan—part of a broader budget proposal that would cut spending by 5.8 trillion over 10 years—is more rhetorical than legislative. After passing the proposal last month, House leaders have made it clear they won't craft the detailed legislation needed to advance the Ryan plan. That is not softening the Democrats' attacks. \\"We took that fight to one of the most conservative congressional districts in America. We won,\\" Mr. Israel said. \\"So we will continue the strategy.\\" Mark Gersh, a consultant to House Democrats, said Republicans control 97 seats in districts more Democratic than the one they lost Tuesday. \\"You couldn't win all of them, but you have the potential to win a lot of them,\\" Mr. Gersh said. GOP strategist David Winston said the challenge for Republicans is to keep the political discussion on the government's debt problem. \\"The Democrats want to cherry-pick issues and make it just about Medicare, whereas the challenge for Republicans is to broaden it to make it about economy, jobs and making government solvent, and Medicare is part of that,\\" Mr. Winston said. Republicans who want to broaden the conversation away from Medicare to other issues have an opportunity Thursday, when House Republicans unveil a package of measures that they say will boost economic growth by lowering corporate taxes and curbing regulations. Republicans argue that Mr. Obama and the Democrats have no plan to rescue Medicare, despite estimates that it will be unable to pay out full benefits beginning in 2024. Democrats respond Mr. Obama's health law contains plans for trimming Medicare that preserve the traditional nature of the program. The president has also suggested empowering a 15-member board to make cost-saving suggestions for Medicare, which Republicans deride as rationing. Republicans also warned against overstating the results of the special election. Because of Mr. Davis' third-party challenge, they argued, Ms. Corwin had to spend time and energy attacking Mr. Davis before she could turn to fending off Ms. Hochul's criticism. —Patrick O'Connor, Jonathan Weisman and Damian Paletta contributed to this article.

But the unity among Republicans — with only five out of 47 voting against it — served as an important sign that party leaders remain wedded to a deficit-reduction plan that is a loyalty test for many GOP voters but is widely unpopular, according to polls. Wednesday’s vote underscored the pressure being exerted by the party’s tea party base to stick with the plan, sponsored by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (Wis.), and the calculation by Republican officials that they have time before the 2012 election to neutralize any of the Democrats’ political advantages. Moreover, in the Senate, the GOP has some breathing room, with only 10 members up for re­election next year and just one considered vulnerable. Still, signs of unease about Ryan’s approach remain within the party. Several GOP presidential contenders have steered clear of the Medicare provision, with both former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, a presumed candidate, saying in recent days that they will soon release their own plans. Even some of the 40 senators who voted for it openly discussed their interest in finding alternatives. “I don’t think there’s anybody in this room that would say it’s an article of faith,” said Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.). Democrats, meanwhile, celebrated their victory in New York’s 26th Congressional District as a sign that Medicare could be a winning issue in next year’s election. But some in the party have begun to acknowledge that they must engage, to at least some degree, in talks about the future of the popular entitlement, with polls showing that the public wants both parties to find solutions to the country’s fiscal ills. Hours before the Senate vote Wednesday, former president Bill Clinton urged Congress, including his fellow Democrats, not to “tippy-toe around” Medicare, saying the program “is part of a whole health-care system that has a toxic effect on inflation.” Speaking at a conference about fiscal challenges, Clinton warned Democrats to be wary of weighing the issue solely for political gain, adding: “We’ve got to deal with these things.” Vice President Biden, leading bipartisan negotiations to devise a plan for cutting the deficit, said Tuesday night that “big-ticket items” such as entitlements must be addressed. The Democrats, however, are continuing to bash Ryan’s approach and are not proposing major, new ideas of their own. Policy experts said most of the ideas being circulated by the party — including government-negotiated prices for medicine that older Americans buy — reprise long-held views that Republicans oppose. House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said Medicare “needs to be on the table.” But he added that he would not risk a backlash by identifying concrete changes he would support, saying, “That is the same mistake that . . . Ryan made.” Medicare has become one of the largest contributors to the nation’s precarious financial state. The program, which provides health insurance to 47 million elderly and disabled Americans, is an enormously popular entitlement, but the part of it that pays hospital bills is forecast to run short of money within 13 years. The Ryan plan would transform Medicare from a public insurance system that guarantees specific benefits, no matter the cost, into a program that would give beneficiaries subsidies to buy private health plans. The idea is known as “premium support,” because it would help pay for insurance premiums, and it would begin for people who turn 65 in 2022. Ryan’s version would go further than earlier premium-support proposals, because it would drop the original fee-for-service version of Medicare, dating to the mid-1960s, rather than preserving it as an alternative. Democrats are open, for now, to a very different set of ideas, so it remains unclear whether there is space for a compromise involving Medicare changes as part of a broad plan to lessen the deficit. According to sources on Capitol Hill and among health policy experts, Democrats remain resistant to any changes that would reduce the services Medicare covers. And at this week’s negotiating session with Biden on the deficit, there was no talk of controversial ideas that have been considered in the past: raising the eligibility age for the program or further requiring affluent older Americans to pay higher prices for the benefits. Instead, Democrats are largely looking at ideas they have advocated in the past that could affect pharmaceutical companies, medical schools and payments to doctors and other care providers . Democrats are also quick to point out that the 2010 law designed to overhaul the nation’s health care system — legislation that House Republicans have voted to repeal — already set in motion changes that will slow Medicare spending. One current idea, which Democrats have favored since Congress added drug benefits to Medicare in 2003, is to give the government the ability to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies over the prices of medicines purchased within the program. Democrats are also proposing that older Americans who are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid as well as Medicare, be able to get medicine at the lower prices available through Medicaid — an idea that was considered, but ultimately not included, in last year’s health care law. In addition, Democrats are considering changes to Medicare’s subsidies for graduate medical education and exploring ways to clamp down further on fraud and abuse in the program. In an early sign of the likely resistance to even these more modest Democratic ideas, a coalition of hospital organizations announced Wednesday that it was beginning to run advertisements in Washington-area publications protesting cuts, beyond those in last year’s health care law, as part of a deficit-lowering plan. “Enough is enough,” the ad says. The budget plan passed the House with all GOP votes on April 15. The proposal was one of several budget measures the Senate voted on Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) pushed to hold them that day, less than 24 hours after the New York polls closed, and allowed several competing visions to be offered. Each was doomed to defeat. But that was part of the point: Both parties wanted to prove that the other’s opening proposal could not secure the bipartisan collection of 60 votes needed to win final passage in the Senate. Every Democrat opposed the Ryan proposal over the Medicare issue, as did four centrist Republicans — Sens. Scott Brown (Mass.), Susan Collins (Maine), Olympia J. Snowe (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska). Brown could be vulnerable in his re­election bid next year. Snowe, while facing a possible tea party challenge in the Republican primary, cast a vote that could help her in the general election. Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), the fifth Republican defector, said the Ryan plan was too timid in dealing with the 14.3 trillion national debt. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) then called up Obama’s initial 2012 budget proposal for consideration. Both parties had criticized the plan, saying it would offer only a minor reduction in the national debt. The president has since put forward a new blueprint that would shave 4 trillion from projected deficits over 12 years. With Obama himself abandoning his initial budget proposal, not a single senator voted for it. Even as some Republican strategists acknowledged that Medicare had played a role in the New York defeat, they said they intend to double down on their sales pitch. Grover Norquist, president of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, said his group plans to distribute to 150,000 activists nationwide five-minute videos of Ryan describing his proposal. Norquist said he is also exploring a campaign training seminar to teach grass-roots operatives how to better defend what he calls the doctrine of the modern-day GOP. “The best defense is clarity,” Norquist said. “The challenge will be to teach each of our activists to deliver the Ryan speech.” Policy experts say Democrats will remain eager to let the GOP pursue its course. “I just don’t see the Democrats willing to take Ryan and the Republicans off the limb they are dangling from,” said Robert Laszewski, a health policy specialist with clients across the health-care industry. “Democrats are just licking their chops on this one.” ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"This article talks about Republican lawmakers continuing to support a plan to change Medicare, a health program for older people in the United States.

The are closing in on a division title and a bye in the first round of the playoffs, and the Ben Roethlisberger (FSY) showed off Pittsburgh's deep passing game and the Steelers cruised past the Panthers 27-3 on Thursday night. \\"It's definitely playoff football right now,\\" safety Ryan Clark (FSY) said. \\"We want that bye, at least one game on our home field.\\" Pittsburgh (11-4), bouncing back from Sunday's 22-17 loss to the Jets, will wrap up the AFC North and the bye if it beats Cleveland on Jan. 2. The Browns (5-9) could end the division race even earlier than that if they upset the Ravens (10-4) at home on Sunday. \\"There's some hardware out there for us, the AFC North title, and that more than anything is what we're focused on,\\" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. Roethlisberger found Mike Wallace (FSY) on a 43-yard scoring play and Emmanuel Sanders (FSY) on a 35-yard completion to set up Rashard Mendenhall's (FSY) 1-yard touchdown run as the Steelers opened a 20-0 halftime lead. Roethlisberger ended 22-of-32 for 320 yards and no interceptions. It didn't seem that close and it wasn't, not with Pittsburgh outgaining the Panthers (2-13) by 408-119 while controlling the line of scrimmage, the clock and a Jimmy Clausen-led (FSY) Carolina offense. \\"It's good to be in the clubhouse before everyone else this weekend with a necessary win,\\" Tomlin said. It hasn't been much of a season for the Panthers, who have lost eight of nine, and this wasn't much of a game. Jonathan Stewart (FSY), who averaged 115 yards in his previous four games, was held to 71 yards by a defense that has allowed one 100-yard rusher in 49 games. \\"They're 2-13 for a reason, and you've got to keep them that way,\\" Clark said. \\"You don't want to give them any confidence they can play it down to the wire, so we put it away early.\\" Carolina, the NFL's only winless team on the road, took the opening kickoff, drove to the Steelers 32 and chose to punt on fourth-and-6 as a disappointed Clausen (10-of-23, 72 yards) threw his hands up in disgust. \\"I thought offensively we came out fast, running the ball well, got a few first downs quick,\\" Clausen said. \\"And just from there, I don't know what happened.\\" That was about it for the Panthers, who had zero net yards and no first downs from the end of the first quarter until the final 90 seconds in the third. \\"We've obviously had our struggles at that position,\\" said Carolina coach John Fox, who has used four quarterbacks in the NFL's worst-ranked offense. \\"That was pretty solid defense we played. Offensively, it wasn't very good.\\" Mendenhall ran for 35 yards on Pittsburgh's first play from scrimmage, and that quickly set the tone. Roethlisberger then hit Wallace for 15 yards and tight end Heath Miller (FSY) for 20, leading to Shaun Suisham's (FSY) 26-yard field goal. Carolina successfully challenged an apparent Roethlisberger-to-Sanders 8-yard scoring pass play, with replays showing Sanders didn't maintain control as he struck the ground. That kept the Steelers out of the end zone, but it didn't take them long to get there. \\"We had a bunch of breakdowns, a bunch of big plays (allowed),\\" Carolina defensive end Charles Johnson (FSY) said. Bryant McFadden (FSY), who left later with a hip injury, intercepted a Clausen pass to set up Roethlisberger's scoring pass to Wallace that made it 10-0 early in the second quarter. Wallace caught the ball in stride at the 33 and easily outraced two defenders to the end zone. He ended with four catches for 104 yards in his sixth 100-yard receiving game, one off John Stallworth's team record. \\"I like where he is right now, but he is capable of more,\\" Tomlin said. \\"There's more out there for him.\\" Roethlisberger's 35-yard completion to Sanders on second-and-18 led to Mendenhall's 1-yard touchdown run with 1:54 left before halftime. \\"They were stacking the line of scrimmage to stop the run so, when you see that, you've got to take what they give you,\\" Tomlin said of a passing game that outgained Carolina's 293-45. \\"Guys got open and Ben distributed the football to them.\\" About then, the fans were shifting their attention to the more competitive Penguins-Capitals game in Washington. Pascal Dupuis' decisive goal in Pittsburgh's 3-2 shootout win set off a definite buzz in Heinz Field, which NHL ice specialist Dan Craig was waiting to convert into an outdoor rink for the Jan. 1 Winter Classic. The conversion was to begin even before the Panthers left town following their seventh consecutive road loss this season. Right on cue, it began to snow as the NHL officials began their work. Roethlisberger, whose previously broken nose was bloodied on a hit in the first half, also scored on a 1-yard run in the third quarter as the Steelers spent much of the second half running the ball before a fast-emptying stadium. \\"We've got to find a way to finish games — we've got a lot of young guys (on offense),\\" Roethlisberger said. \\"That's why it was good to keep us in there.\\" NOTES: The Steelers scored three touchdowns after having only four on offense in their previous four games. ... Clausen, the rookie from Notre Dame, has two touchdown passes and eight interceptions. ... Roethlisberger is 12-1 at home against NFC teams. He has thrown one interception in six games. ... The Steelers have won after each of their four losses this season. ... Carolina avoided its first shutout since 2002 when John Kasay (FSY) kicked a 27-yard field goal with 8:29 remaining. ... Suisham connected twice but missed for the first time in his 13 attempts this season. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Blues striker netted penalty during 6-0 victory against Maribor. Ivory Coast star has now scored in 12 successive campaigns. Raul holds the record on 14 whilst Ryan Giggs managed 11. Article:","completion":"Title: Didier Drogba Marks His Return to Chelsea with a Goal, Continues His Scoring Streak Body: After spending two seasons away from the West London club, Didier Drogba made a blistering return to Chelsea, scoring his first goal since rejoining the Blues in their 6-0 victory over Maribor in the UEFA Champions League. The Ivorian striker cemented his legendary status at the club by slotting a penalty, taking his incredible scoring streak to 12 successive campaigns. The match against Maribor, held at the Stamford Bridge, witnessed Chelsea put up a ruthless performance, dismantling their Slovenian opponents to maintain their unbeaten run in the group stage. Drogba's moment of glory arrived in the 23rd minute when he stepped up to take a penalty and calmly put the ball past the hapless goalkeeper. The atmosphere in the stadium was electric as fans celebrated the return of their talismanic striker in style. Drogba's impressive streak of scoring in 12 consecutive campaigns sees him approaching the record set by Spanish footballing icon, Raul, who has a staggering 14 successive campaigns to his name. Former Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs, who managed 11 consecutive campaigns, has already been surpassed by the unstoppable Ivorian. After first signing with Chelsea in 2004, Didier Drogba quickly established himself as one of the best strikers in the club's history, playing a pivotal role in helping Chelsea win numerous trophies, including four Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League in 2012. The Ivorian's strong, powerful, and athletic style of play have made him a nightmare for defenders. Combining skill and strength, he has also become a great example for young players hoping to make an impact at the highest level. After short stints in China and Turkey, Drogba's return to Chelsea, initially, raised some eyebrows, especially considering his age and diminished playing time. However, his performance against Maribor showed that the 36-year-old striker still has plenty of fuel left in the tank and continues to be a valuable asset for the Blues. Chelsea's manager, José Mourinho, expressed his delight in Drogba's performance, saying, \\"I am really happy with Didier's goal. He is a very important player for us, and I am sure he will continue to contribute this season. His experience, character, and winning mentality have a significant impact on the younger players in the team.\\" As Didier Drogba continues to defy father time and break records, he solidifies his status as one of the greatest strikers in the history of football. His return to Chelsea has added an extra layer of excitement in the already thrilling Premier League season. With Drogba's goal-scoring prowess cemented in history, just two more seasons of successful goal-scoring will see him match the legendary Raul's record and further etch his name among the all-time greats. In conclusion, Didier Drogba's triumphant return to Chelsea and his scoring streak of 12 successive campaigns speaks volumes about the stamina, talent, and determination of this unstoppable Ivorian forward. With Drogba's current form, fans and teammates alike will be eagerly anticipating his next goal, hoping it brings them one step closer to catching Raul's impressive record and adding more silverware to Chelsea's illustrious trophy cabinet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which types of boards have four holes where the binding threads were laced through? ? The boards of the covers, previously assumed to be limewood, are now thought to be birch, an unusual wood in later bindings, but one easily available in northern England. Both have four holes where the binding threads were laced through; the two threads were run round the inner edges of the cover and knotted back at the holes. The front cover has an additional 12 holes where the ends of the cords for the raised framing lines went through, at the four corners of the two main frames, and the ends of the horizontal bars between the interlace panels and the central vine motif.The stitching of the binding uses \\"Coptic sewing\\", that is \\"flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round one another in a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)\\" Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords. Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface. This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique. The first appearance of the cords or supports that these \\"unsupported\\" bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques. The cords run horizontally across the spine, and are thicker than the threads...

Plot title: Never Cry Wolf Movie plot: A young, naive Canadian biologist named Tyler (Charles Martin Smith) (portraying the real-life biologist Farley Mowat) is assigned by the government to travel to the isolated Canadian arctic wilderness and study why the local caribou population is declining, believed due to indiscriminate wolf-pack attacks. Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by an odd, adventurous bush pilot named Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler and his gear in the middle of a frozen lake in a sub-zero Arctic nowhere. Unsure of where to start, Tyler's indecision quickly imperils him when he runs into a traveling wolf pack until he is rescued by a travelling elderly Inuit native named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who builds a shelter for him.Alone, Tyler's days are divided between research and mere personal survival, while nights are fraught with anxiety-born nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them, slowly dispelling their mutual fears. He and the wolves both begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them.As the spring season arrives and the winter snow slowly melts, Tyler (being a person of procedure) soon discovers the simple, blunt arctic is indifferent to his sense of order. First dealing with sub-freezing weather extremes, ranging from cold snow to warmer heavy spring rains, compromise his shelter, his paperwork duties, his research. Complicating matters further are an invasive horde of Arctic mice when they show up after the spring thaw: they are everywhere, frustrating him and the wolves. Yet the wolves seem to cope with the madness by eating the mice, which Tyler emulates in his own bizarre way to see if an animal can survive on mice alone.During the mild summer season, another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) encounters Tyler, who was sent by Ootek for...

Email Print On Saturday, June 21 one of the Republic of Namibia’s rare desert elephants was felled by a hunter’s rifle. Unlike most of the other elephants that die on any given day in Africa, this particular elephant was slain legally. Namibia has reportedly sold nine hunting permits to foreign hunters for undisclosed amounts. Two of the bulls, including the first to be killed last month, are “problem” animals who have come into conflict with local humans. The remaining seven will be killed for their trophies. Desert elephants, which can only be found in Namibia and Mali, are not a separate species or subspecies. They are, however, uniquely adapted to their arid environments. The animals have a few morphological differences from savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana), most notably their thinner bodies and wider feet. They also possess a number of unique behaviors shared by no other African elephants, such as digging wells to purify their drinking water. Tourists routinely travel to Namibia to volunteer in the elephants’ conservation and organizations such as Desert Lion and Elephant Conservation have been set up to protect and study them. Namibia’s desert elephants were nearly wiped out by poachers before the international ivory ban was first established in 1989. The country says it is now home to about 600 desert elephants, a number that conservationists dispute. According to the Conservation Action Trust, there are only about 100 desert elephants left in Namibia, including just 18 adult males. The cull would remove half of those males. According to the organization, the loss of adult role models would create more behavior problems in the future and also result in a loss of the population’s unique mannerisms. Namibia, however, does not see its desert elephants as animals that are any different from the other elephants within its borders. In a press release (pdf) sent at the beginning of June, Simeon N. Negumbo, permanent secretary of Namibia’s Ministry of Environment and Tourism, wrote that the country is home to more than 20,000 elephants and the region where the hunts will take place has a total of 391 elephants with a 55 percent sex ratio. He called desert elephants “tourist attractions” and said all elephants in the country are “no longer rare…but only potentially valuable.” He noted that human–wildlife conflict is increasing, and that some humans have been killed by elephant attacks. Especially ironic given that last point, a hunter named Johann Louw was attacked and trampled by a Namibian elephant on July 5. Louw and his hunting party had reportedly received one of the nine desert elephant hunting permits. Louw has been hospitalized. The fate of the elephant that attacked him is unknown as of this writing. This entire situation echoes so many of the problems facing elephants today. In many regions the animals are being poached into oblivion. In a few others they are mostly protected and breeding well but are also increasingly crowded into ever-shrinking habitats, putting them in conflict with both humans and their own kind as they compete for food and space. I have been writing about elephants now for 25 years and it’s impossible to say how this will all pan out. Tragically, the only certain outcome I can see these days is death.

Premise: - There's a stock ingenue named Susan Lynch. - There is a pig farmer named James Nesbitt. - Susan loves James but won't marry him due to his bad smell. Hypothesis: - Susan Lynch works with stocks (stock ingenue could be referring to a common female character type). - She fell in love with James Nesbitt. - James is a farmer and owns pigs. - They will not marry. Step 2: Compare the components in the premise and hypothesis. - Susan Lynch is mentioned in both premise and hypothesis. In the premise, she is the stock ingenue. In the hypothesis, it interprets this as Susan working with stocks. However, the phrase 'stock ingenue' suggests she is a stereotype character, likely in a theatrical setting, rather than someone working with stocks. Thus, the hypothesis may not accurately represent this aspect of the premise. - James Nesbitt is a pig farmer - this information is consistent between the premise and hypothesis. - Susan's love for James is mentioned in both and is consistent. - The premise explains that Susan won't marry James due to his smell. The hypothesis states they will not marry. While the hypothesis does not mention the reason, the information that they won't marry remains consistent. Step 3: Evaluate if the hypothesis entails the premise. Entailment means that if the premise is true, the hypothesis necessarily follows to be true. In this case: - The hypothesis accurately captures Susan's love for James, James being a pig farmer, and that they will not marry. - However, the hypothesis misinterprets \\"stock ingenue\\" as \\"Susan working with stocks\\" which is not consistent with the premise. Conclusion: The hypothesis partially entails the premise. It does capture the key aspects of Susan's love for James, his occupation, and their decision not to marry. However, it misinterprets the term \\"stock ingenue,\\" which causes some discrepancy between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In 1880, his son John Church Hamilton commissioned Carl Conrads to sculpt a granite statue, now located in Central Park, New York City. One statue honoring Alexander Hamilton in Chicago was mired in controversy, at least concerning the surrounding architecture. Kate Sturges Buckingham (1858-1937), of the Buckingham Fountain family, commissioned the monument. Its impetus was that Treasury Secretary Hamilton \\"secured the nation's financial future and made it possible for her own family to make its fortune in grain elevators and banking. Consequently, John Angel was hired to model a figurative sculpture and the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen was to create a \\"colossal architectural setting\\" for it. The proposed 80-foot tall columned shelter was poorly received. By Ms. Buckingham's death in 1937, the sculpture's setting. location and design were uncertain. Conspiracy allegations surfaced, and the matter became mired in litigation. After the courts ordered the construction to be completed by 1953, the trustees hired architect Samuel A. Marx. The structure was completed, had structural problems, and was eventually demolished in 1993. The statue was gilded, and is still on display.

Africa's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea, cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about 2.58 million years ago (the start of the Quaternary Period), the current ice age began.

Jens Ingemar Johansson (Swedish: ['ING:emar 2ju:hans,son]; 22 September 1932 - 30 January 2009) was a Swedish professional boxer who competed from 1952 to 1963. He held the world heavyweight title from 1959 to 1960, and was the fifth heavyweight champion born outside the United States. Johansson won the title by defeating Floyd Patterson via third-round stoppage, after flooring him seven times in that round. For this achievement, Johansson was awarded the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year--the only non-American to do so in the belt's entire 27-year existence--and was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year and Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year. Johansson earned his shot at the world heavyweight crown when he knocked out top ranked contender Eddie Machen in the first round of their elimination match on 14 September 1958. In front of 53,615 fans in Ullevi football stadium, Johansson downed Machen three times, finally finishing him with a barrage of punches at 2:16 of the first round. Johansson then signed to fight champion Floyd Patterson. Johansson was a colourful figure in New York City as he trained for the fight. Eschewing the monastic training regimen favored by Patterson and other fighters, Johansson trained at the Catskill resort of Grossingers. He did not seem to train particularly hard, and was often seen at night spots with his attractive girlfriend, Elaine Sloane, whom he asked out while she was working for Sports Illustrated. He entered the ring in Yankee Stadium on 26 June 1959, as a 5-1 underdog. Johansson spent the first two rounds of the encounter retreating and flicking a light left jab at the champion. In the third round, Johansson threw a wide left hook that Patterson blocked with his right hand. When he moved his right hand away from its protective peek-a-boo position before his chin, Johansson drilled him with a short powerful right hand. Patterson went down, arose on unsteady legs and was out on his feet. Johansson followed up his advantage and sent Patterson down six more times in the round before the bout was stopped by referee Ruby Goldstein. Johansson celebrated with his girlfriend and future wife Birgit Lundgren and the next day a headline in a New York newspaper expressed the city's amazement. It read: \\"Ingo - It's Bingo.\\" When Johansson returned to Sweden, he flew in on a helicopter, landing in the main football stadium in Gothenburg, his home town, and was cheered by 20,000 people. He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, as well as the cover of Life Magazine on 20 July 1959, alongside Birgit. Johansson was a flamboyant champion - a precursor to the \\"Swinging Sixties\\". One publication dubbed Johansson \\"boxing's Cary Grant\\" and in 1960 he appeared in the movie All the Young Men as a marine, alongside stars Alan Ladd and Sidney Poitier. Wherever he went, in the U.S. or in Sweden, he had a beautiful woman on his arm, with paparazzi snapping pictures. To train for the third fight with Patterson, Ingemar sparred with a young Muhammad Ali, (known then as Cassius Clay) in Miami Beach. After Cassius had \\"boxed his way around the ring, as if it was he, using 'Ingo' as a sparring partner\\", somebody offered 100,000 to Ingemar to fight in a televised event with Ali, but Ingemar declined saying that the fight would not draw three ticket holders and that Ali did not have the ability to step in the ring with him at that time.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: who did he fight?","completion":"Johansson fought Floyd Patterson for the world heavyweight title, and in the third fight, he sparred with a young Muhammad Ali (known then as Cassius Clay) during his training."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While they both inquire about the favorite food of the person being asked, they are framed differently and elicit slightly different responses. Let's break down the differences between the two questions. 1. \\"What’s your favorite food to eat?\\" This question asks directly about the person's favorite food or meal, without specifying any particular category or type of food. The person is expected to provide a single answer, focusing solely on their most preferred food item overall. 2. \\"What is your favorite food and dessert?\\" This question is asking for two distinct pieces of information - the person's favorite food and their favorite dessert. The question specifically requests for the favorite dessert in addition to the favorite food, which makes it different from the first question. In the first question, a person might answer, \\"My favorite food is pizza.\\" For the second question, the response could be, \\"My favorite food is pizza, and my favorite dessert is chocolate cake.\\" From these contrasting responses, it is evident that the two questions are not the same. Additionally, by mentioning desserts explicitly, the second question guides the person to think about their favorite food in a broader context, possibly considering their favorite main course as well as their preferred sweet treat. These nuanced differences between the questions make their intent and required answers distinct, leading to the conclusion that they are not the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the country where the river is located, as ownership laws vary between countries. 2. Research the specific laws, regulations, or government systems in that country related to navigable river ownership. 3. Determine if the river passes through multiple jurisdictions (states, provinces, etc.), as ownership laws may also vary between these jurisdictions. Without more information on the specific river and its location, I am unable to provide a definitive answer. However, I can provide a general answer based on the laws in the United States: In the United States, the land under navigable rivers is generally owned by the state in which the river is located. This is based on the \\"Public Trust Doctrine,\\" which holds that navigable waters and the lands beneath them are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public. The doctrine ensures public access to and use of these resources for activities such as navigation, fishing, and recreation. Ownership may vary in other countries, so if the river in question is located outside the United States, further research would be needed to determine the specific laws governing ownership in that jurisdiction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The flowers in the garden of Jason were prettier than Kyle's because","completion":"Jason had dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to cultivate and nurture his garden with such precision and care. He had meticulously researched the best practices in gardening, ensuring the vibrant colors and distinctive fragrances would become the most prominent feature of his flowerbeds. Kyle, on the other hand, had been less devoted to his hobby. While he still enjoyed gardening, he simply lacked the same level of passion and commitment that drove Jason to create a veritable paradise in his own backyard. The two friends lived in adjacent houses, separated by a short wooden fence which allowed them to peek into each other's gardens. They had always been competitive, but this rivalry extended far beyond mere sports or simple games. In fact, gardening had become a sort of battleground upon which the superiority of each man's skills and dedication was constantly being judged. And, while Kyle's garden was lovely in its own right, it simply could not compete with the horticultural pantheon that Jason had constructed. Jason was a stickler for detail. He would wake up before the crack of dawn every day to tend to his beloved garden. Every plant and flower was carefully chosen to enhance the natural beauty of the area, adhering to a strict color palette and layout that he had expertly designed. He ensured that each flower had access to an optimal balance of sunlight, shade, and moisture, and even spoke to his plants, believing that the sound of a loving human voice contributed to their growth and well-being. Furthermore, Jason had a secret weapon in his arsenal – the sacred art of companion planting. He was well-versed in the lore and wisdom of the ancients when it came to determining which species of mint would help to repel pests from his roses, or what type of marigold would provide the perfect complementary shade of color to accent his Asiatic lilies. Each plant was thoughtfully placed in order to attain a harmonious synergy, contributing to a garden that was not only pleasing to the eye but to the very soul as well. Kyle, though a decent gardener himself, simply could not match Jason’s dedication. His approach was more carefree and laid-back, planting the flowers he liked without much concern for their compatibility with other species. His garden was a hodgepodge of colors and fragrances, with little structure or order. While some might find this randomness endearing, it was clear to everyone – including Kyle – that Jason's garden was truly superior. Kyle often found himself standing at the fence, staring enviously at Jason's colorful displays and the exquisite scents that drifted through the air, wishing that his own garden could be even a fraction as magnificent. One day, as he stood there admiring the view, something changed in him. The competitive spirit that had fueled so many of their rivalries in the past transformed into a desire to learn and grow. He approached Jason and asked for his guidance, seeking to improve his own gardening skills. Jason, never one to be prideful, gladly offered his assistance and shared his knowledge with Kyle. Over time, they began working on their gardens together, and their neighborly competition transformed into camaraderie, with both gardens flourishing under their combined efforts. While Jason's garden would always remain the more breathtaking of the two, Kyle took solace in the friendship they had cultivated. The once fiery rivalry had bloomed into a shared passion for gardening, which brought them closer and enriched their lives in ways they had never before imagined. And, to those fortunate enough to visit their gardens, it was clear that the true beauty of Jason and Kyle's creations was not only found in the vivid hues and fragrances of their flowers, but in the bond they had forged through their shared labor of love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically. Question: \\"Why was Menorca's economy devastated for decades?\\" Answer: \\"Alfonso III of Aragón found a pretext for invasion\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Answer: \\"No, that answer is not correct.\\" The correct answer is: \\"Menorca's economy was devastated for decades because after Alfonso III of Aragón invaded the island in 1287, the Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. This led to a significant loss of people, skills, and resources that affected the island's economy for a long time.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After receiving thirty pieces of silver from the highly feared Jewish priests of the Temple in Jerusalem, one of Jesus' other apostles, Judas Iscariot, tells them the location where his teacher is and the priests send a contingent of guards to arrest Jesus for heresy.In the woods outside Gethsemane, Judas approaches with the temple guards and betrays Jesus with a kiss on his cheek. As the guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter intervenes and attacks them, cutting off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards, but Jesus tells Peter to stop with the violence and magically heals Malchus' ear. The temple guards arrest Jesus and the rest of the apostles flee.John runs and tells Jesus' mother, Mary, as well as Mary Magdalene of the arrest, and Peter follows Jesus at a distance who is severely beaten by the Temple guards on their way back to Jerusalem.

Background: The Strokes are an American rock band from New York City. Formed in 1998, the band is composed of singer Julian Casablancas, lead guitarist Nick Valensi, rhythm guitarist Albert Hammond Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. Following the conclusion of five-album deals with RCA and Rough Trade, the band has continued to release new music through Casablancas' Cult Records. Met with widespread critical acclaim, the Strokes' 2001 debut, Is This It, helped usher in the garage rock revival movement of the early-21st century--and ranks number eight on Rolling Stone's 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time, number two on Rolling Stone's 100 Best Albums of the '00s, 199 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and number four in the NME top 500 albums of all time. Context: The group began recording their follow-up in 2002 with producer Nigel Godrich (best known for his work with Radiohead), but later split with him in favor of Gordon Raphael, the producer of Is This It. Recordings with Godrich were never revealed. In August 2003, the band toured Japan, playing a couple of the upcoming songs: \\"Reptilia\\", \\"Meet Me In The Bathroom\\", \\"The Way It Is\\", \\"Between Love & Hate\\" (formerly known as \\"Ze Newie\\") and \\"12:51\\" (formerly known as \\"Supernova\\"). The band also played Paul Anka's \\"My Way\\" with Japanese lyrics. The Strokes released their second album Room on Fire in October 2003. It received praise from critics but was less commercially successful, although it still went gold. The album's sound maintained the Strokes' familiar reference points, while also evoking groups such as the Cars, Bob Marley, and Blondie. In the process, they made the cover of Spin Magazine for the second time, with each member receiving his own cover. They also made the cover of Rolling Stone for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress Drew Barrymore, which ended in January 2007. The first single taken from Room on Fire was the song \\"12:51\\", which used distinct keyboard-like sounds produced by Valensi's guitar.

Movie title: The Untouchables Movie plot: During Prohibition in 1930, Al Capone has nearly the whole city of Chicago under his control and supplies illegal liquor. Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness is assigned to stop Capone, but his first attempt at a liquor raid fails due to corrupt policemen tipping Capone off. He has a chance meeting with Irish-American veteran officer Jimmy Malone, who is fed up with the rampant corruption and offers to help Ness, suggesting that they find a man from the police academy who has not come under Capone's influence. They recruit Italian-American trainee George Stone (aka-Giuseppe Petri) for his superior marksmanship and intelligence. Joined by accountant Oscar Wallace, assigned to Ness from Washington, D.C., they conduct a successful raid on a Capone liquor cache and start to gain positive publicity, with the press dubbing them \\"The Untouchables.\\" Capone later kills the henchman in charge of the cache as a warning to his other men. Wallace discovers that Capone has not filed an income tax return for some years and suggests that the team try to build a tax evasion case against him, since he is well-insulated from his other crimes. An alderman offers Ness a bribe to drop his investigation, but Ness angrily refuses it and throws him out of the office. When Capone gunman Frank Nitti threatens Ness' family, Ness has his wife and daughter moved to a safe house. His team flies to the CanadaâUnited States border to intercept an incoming liquor shipment, aided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, killing several gangsters and capturing George, a Capone bookkeeper. Malone shoots a gangster through the mouth (not revealing the man is already dead) to scare George into agreeing to testify against Capone. Wallace prepares to escort George from the Chicago police station to a safe house, but they are shot and killed by Nitti, who has infiltrated the station. Ness confronts Capone and his men over the deaths, but Malone intervenes to save him from being killed and urges him to persuade the district attorney not to dismiss...

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Math Problem Solve 0 = -491*y + 413*y - 3276 for y.","completion":"To solve the equation for y, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The equation is 0 = -491*y + 413*y - 3276. Since -491*y and 413*y are like terms (both are multiples of y), we can combine them: 0 = (-491 + 413) * y - 3276 0 = (-78) * y - 3276 Step 2: Isolate the variable, y. To isolate y, we need to move the -3276 to the other side of the equation and then divide by -78: 0 + 3276 = -78 * y 3276 = -78 * y Step 3: Solve for y. Now, divide both sides of the equation by -78: 3276 / -78 = y Step 4: Calculate the value of y.

It is located between two peaks called the North and South Guardian Angels , deep within the Left Fork of North Creek . It is part of the larger Great West Canyon system , which includes both the Left and Right Forks of North Creek . The Subway is so named for its tube - like , undercut slot canyons . This segment of canyon is less than 0.25 miles ( 0.40 km ) in length , but long approach and exit hikes are necessary for access . - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\". - Utah (or ) is a state in the western United States. It became the 45th state admitted to the U.S. on January 4, 1896. Utah is the 13th-largest by area, 31st-most-populous, and 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States. Utah has a population of more than 3 million (Census estimate for July 1, 2016), approximately 80% of whom live along the Wasatch Front, centering on the state capital Salt Lake City. Utah is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast. - Mesa (Portuguese and Spanish for \\"table\\") is the American English term for tableland, an elevated area of land with a flat top and sides that are usually steep cliffs. It takes its name from its characteristic table-top shape. It may also be called a table hill, table-topped hill or table mountain. It is larger than a butte, which it otherwise resembles closely. - Zion Canyon (also called Little Zion, Mukuntuweap, Mu-Loon'-Tu-Weap, and Straight Cañon; \\"weap\\" is Paiute for canyon) is a deep and narrow gorge in southwestern Utah, United States, carved by the North Fork of the Virgin River. Nearly the entire canyon is located within the western half of Zion National Park. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - A slot canyon is a narrow canyon, formed by the wear of water rushing through rock. A slot canyon is significantly deeper than it is wide. Some slot canyons can measure less than across at the top but drop more than to the floor of the canyon. - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera (from the - \\"cheir\\", \\"hand\\" and - \\"pteron\\", \\"wing\\") whose forelimbs form webbed wings, making them the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. By contrast, other mammals said to fly, such as flying squirrels, gliding possums, and colugos, can only glide for short distances. Bats do not flap their entire forelimbs, as birds do, but instead flap their spread-out digits, which are very long and covered with a thin membrane or patagium. - The Southwestern United States (also known as the American Southwest) is a region of the United States which includes Arizona, the western portion of New Mexico, bordered on the east by the Llano Estacado, southern Colorado and Utah below the 39th parallel, the \\"horn\\" of Texas below New Mexico, the southernmost triangle of Nevada, and the most southeastern portion of California, which encompasses the Mojave and Colorado Deserts. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - The Mojave Desert is an arid rain-shadow desert and the driest desert in North America. It is located in the southwestern United States, primarily within southeastern California and southern Nevada, and it occupies a total of . Very small areas also extend into Utah and Arizona. Its boundaries are generally noted by the presence of Joshua trees, which are native only to the Mojave Desert and are considered an indicator species, and it is believed to support an additional 1,750 to 2,000 species of plants. The central part of the desert is sparsely populated, while its peripheries support large communities such as Las Vegas, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, and St. George. - A natural arch, natural bridge or, less commonly, a rock arch is a natural rock formation where an arch has formed with an opening underneath. Natural arches commonly form where inland cliffs, coastal cliffs, fins or stacks are subject to erosion from the sea, rivers or weathering (subaerial processes). - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A canyon (Spanish: cañón) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. - Horse Ranch Mountain is the highest summit in Zion National Park, in Utah. Located in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, it rises above Camp Creek to the north and Taylor Creek to the south. - The Life Zone concept was developed by C. Hart Merriam in 1889 as a means of describing areas with similar plant and animal communities. Merriam observed that the changes in these communities with an increase in latitude at a constant elevation are similar to the changes seen with an increase in elevation at a constant latitude. - Springdale is a town in Washington County, Utah, United States. The population was 529 at the 2010 census. It is located immediately outside the boundaries of Zion National Park, and is oriented around the resulting tourist industry. It was originally settled as a Mormon farming community in 1862 by evacuees from the flooding of nearby Northrop. Springdale was named one of the 20 'prettiest towns' in the United States by Forbes Traveler in 2008. - A butte is an isolated hill with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller than mesas, plateaus, and table landforms. The word butte comes from a French word meaning \\"small hill\\"; its use is prevalent in the Western United States, including the southwest where \\"mesa\\" is also used for the larger landform. Because of their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. In differentiating mesas and buttes, geographers use the rule of thumb that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height. - Navajo Sandstone is a geologic formation in the Glen Canyon Group that is spread across the U.S. states of southern Nevada, northern Arizona, northwest Colorado, and Utah as part of the Colorado Plateau province of the United States. - Zion National Park is located in the Southwestern United States, near Springdale, Utah. A prominent feature of the park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to half a mile (800 m) deep, cut through the reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest elevation is at Coalpits Wash and the highest elevation is at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park's unique geography and variety of life zones allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. - The Colorado Plateau, also known as the Colorado Plateau Province, is a physiographic region of the Intermontane Plateaus, roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. The province covers an area of 337,000 km (130,000 mi) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, and northern Arizona. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado. Most of the remainder of the plateau is drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries. - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location. - Woodland is a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade. Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession. Higher density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are referred to as forests. - The Great Basin is the largest area of contiguous endorheic watersheds in North America. It is noted for both its arid climate and the basin and range topography that varies from the North American low point at Badwater Basin to the highest point of the contiguous United States, less than away at the summit of Mount Whitney. The region spans several physiographic divisions, biomes/ecoregions, and deserts. - The Virgin River is a tributary of the Colorado River in the U.S. states of Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. The river is about long. It was designated Utah's first wild and scenic river in 2009, during the centennial celebration of Zion National Park.

Write a question about the following article: The Mataram conquest of Surabaya or Mataram-Surabaya War was a military campaign by the Sultanate of Mataram in the early 17th century that resulted in the capture of the Duchy of Surabaya and its allies in eastern Java, in modern-day Indonesia. Prior to this conquest, Mataram and Surabaya were rivals for power in central and eastern Java. The campaign began in 1614 when Mataram, under the leadership of Sultan Agung, attacked Surabaya's allies, including Wirasaba. Surabaya and its allies launched a counterattack but were defeated near Pajang in 1616. Over the next few years, Mataram gradually conquered members of the Surabayan alliance, and by 1620, the city of Surabaya itself was under siege, holding out until it surrendered in 1625. With this conquest, Mataram unified most of central and eastern Java under its control, and cemented its position as the dominant power in Java.

When the captain listens, he hears nothing, but Ahab insists in the presence of an emptiness. The target dives into a trench, but the captain abandons his search in favor of photographing the target. The target attacks the submarine as Ahab hears a roar. The sub is brought to the icy surface, and the target identifies itself as a gigantic, white, whale-like creature.

And I was wondering Why did Jesse do this? A:","completion":"Jesse, as an educator or instructor, understands the importance of providing clear guidelines and instructions to his students to ensure smooth functioning of the classroom and to facilitate the learning process. There are several reasons why Jesse wrote instructions on the board for the students on how to turn their assignments in. 1. Accessibility and Visibility: Writing the instructions on the board makes them easily accessible and visible to all students in the classroom. It ensures that everyone gets the same information and can refer to the instructions anytime during the class. This also helps in reducing any classroom distractions and ensuring that students stay focused on their tasks. 2. Reducing Miscommunication: Providing clear guidelines in a written format helps in reducing miscommunication, as students can always refer back to the instructions if they have any doubts or forget any details. This further helps in saving time and maintaining order in the classroom, as students will be less likely to seek clarification from the teacher repeatedly. 3. Encouraging Independence: By providing step-by-step instructions for submitting assignments, Jesse is encouraging his students to be independent and take responsibility for their learning. This fosters a sense of autonomy and self-reliance, which are essential skills for students to develop in preparation for higher education and the workforce. 4. Enhancing Time Management: Detailed instructions about assignment submission help students understand the time frame, method of submission, and any other requirements for completing their tasks. This helps them effectively manage their time and develop a sense of discipline, while also setting realistic expectations for themselves. 5. Catering to Different Learning Styles: Providing instructions in multiple formats caters to the diverse learning styles of students. Some students may prefer verbal instructions, while others might find written instructions on the board more helpful. By complementing verbal instructions with written ones, Jesse is catering to the varied needs of his students and ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. 6. Establishing Consistency and Routine: Displaying instructions for submitting assignments consistently, be it daily or weekly, helps in creating a routine that students can follow. This further aids in fostering a sense of discipline and order, promoting a conducive learning environment. 7. Encouraging Inclusivity: It is possible that some students in Jesse's class might have learning disabilities, language barriers, or other challenges that can make it difficult for them to understand instructions when they are only provided verbally. By writing the instructions on the board, Jesse is ensuring that he is reaching out to all students, thereby promoting an inclusive and supportive educational environment. In summary, Jesse's decision to write instructions on the board for turning in assignments was motivated by various factors, ranging from easing communication and enhancing time management to fostering independence and inclusivity among his students.

Passage: A l'antic Egipte s'empraren materials duradors com la pedra. A aquesta civilització la caracteritza la jerarquia social establerta i una forta creença religiosa en l'altra vida. Com a resultat, van organitzar d'una manera molt professional l'explotació de pedreres i van arribar a realitzar unes escultures altament perfeccionades que van romandre inalterades durant molts segles. L'escultura tallada depenia molt del bloc cúbic del qual podien disposar.[22] En les seves obres, en general, representaren les divinitats mitològiques, els faraons i d'altres personatges importants; també realitzaren, però, petites peces de figures en les quals quedaven reflectits els treballs domèstics.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. How do I construct a chart to a infinitely long cylinder embedded in R^3? How can I find the perimeter of a cylinder? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Hi there! I'll simplify the explanation for both questions and then answer if they are related or not. Question 1: Constructing a chart for an infinitely long cylinder in R^3 Imagine we have a piece of paper that goes on forever and ever (that's the infinitely long part) and it's curving around to make a tube shape (that's the cylinder part). Now, R^3 means we're considering this cylinder in a 3-dimensional space (like our world with up/down, left/right, and front/back). To make a chart for this cylinder, we can pretend we're drawing a flat map for this bendy tube. It's like peeling the tube open and laying it flat on a table. The chart helps us know where to find points and how they connect on this cylinder. Question 2: Finding the perimeter of a cylinder Now, let's think about the cylinder as a can (like a soda can). The perimeter we want to find is the distance around that can at its widest part, which is the circle at the top or the bottom. To find this distance, we need to measure how wide the circle is (also known as the diameter) and use a special number called pi (approximately 3.14). The perimeter, or the distance around the circle, can be calculated with the formula: perimeter = pi x diameter. Are these questions asking about the same information? No, these two questions are asking about different things. The first question is about mapping and understanding how a cylinder exists in a 3-dimensional space. The second question is about a physical property of the cylinder, specifically, the distance around the cylinder at its widest part. These questions involve working with a cylinder, but they focus on different aspects of it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\".

Jackson’s nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs late Tuesday as the president’s doctor was besieged by accusations that he improperly dispensed drugs, created a hostile workplace and became intoxicated on duty. The administration’s decision to fight on in defense of the nomination came hours after President Trump publicly suggested that Jackson should consider pulling out because of the “abuse” he was facing. But by late afternoon, Trump had huddled with Jackson, and White House aides vowed to fight the charges. “I don’t want to put a man through a process like this,” Trump had said earlier when asked about Jackson’s nomination during a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. “It’s too ugly, and it’s too disgusting.” Trump added: “I said to Dr. Jackson, what do you need it for? To be abused by a bunch of politicians? . . . If I was him . . . I wouldn’t do it.” Jackson’s worsening problems flared into public view Tuesday when lawmakers nixed his confirmation hearing scheduled for Wednesday. The hearing was officially postponed by Sen. Johnny Isakson (Ga.), the Republican chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.), the ranking Democrat. Later Tuesday, Tester said during an interview with NPR that the committee had heard complaints from more than 20 current and former military members that Jackson had improperly dispensed drugs, become intoxicated on professional trips and belittled staff members. “We were told stories where he was repeatedly drunk while on duty, where his main job was to take care of the most powerful man in the world,” Tester said. “That’s not acceptable.” Tester told CNN Tuesday that the committee received an allegation that during the Obama administration, Jackson was too inebriated on one trip to perform his duties so another doctor’s assistance was sought. He didn’t specify who was seeking treatment. “There were comments about him being in the hotel room and couldn’t respond because he had been drinking so much,” he said. Tester said concerns about the allegations were “bipartisan in nature,” including from Isakson. A spokeswoman for Isakson said the senator remained undecided about the nomination but continued to harbor serious concerns. White House physician Ronny L. Jackson speaks to reporters during a White House briefing in January. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP) Hours after the president’s news conference, more allegations emerged about Jackson, including a 2012 government report that said he exhibited “unprofessional behavior” and should be removed from his post. “There is a severe and pervasive lack of trust in the leadership that has deteriorated to the point that staff walk on ‘eggshells,’ ” the report found. It described morale under his leadership as in the doldrums and said the office was beset by fighting between Jackson and Jeffrey Kuhlman, President Barack Obama’s doctor at the time. It was another episode where a previously respected figure was lifted to prominence in Trump’s orbit — only to have their sheen and reputation tarnished. Jackson had been widely hailed by three presidents and their aides as competent, charming and fiercely protective before Trump stunned Washington last month by picking the doctor to run the country’s second-largest federal agency. Jackson declined to comment on the accusations, and senior aides said he showed no willingness to drop out Tuesday afternoon as he trudged through meetings with senators on Capitol Hill. Privately, he dismissed some of the charges to senior aides, according to administration officials, and said he was being unfairly attacked. “No, I’m looking forward to the hearing,” Jackson said. “I was looking forward to doing it tomorrow, so I’m looking forward to getting it rescheduled and answering all the questions.” White House officials said they were aware of accusations that Jackson dispensed medicine to aides or others, including reporters, without rigorous scrutiny. But several senior officials said the drugs were usually nonnarcotic ones, such as Ambien. They also said that Jackson was never intoxicated or drinking while working in the White House near Trump, but may have had too much to drink on occasion while taking overseas trips. The White House released several other reports that were laudatory regarding Jackson late Tuesday, including his performance reviews for the past four years. “Ronny does a great job — genuine enthusiasm, poised under pressure, incredible work ethic and follow through. Ronny continues to inspire confidence with the care he provides to me, my family and my team. Continue to promote ahead of peers,” a 2016 note from Obama read. In a private meeting with Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) on Capitol Hill, Jackson denied any wrongdoing, according to the senator. During that meeting, the White House doctor also specifically denied ever drinking on duty, according to a spokesman for the senator. “He does deny that he’s done anything wrong in his service to the country and particularly his time at the White House as a physician in the medical unit,” Moran said, adding that Jackson “indicated that he knows of nothing that would prohibit him from being qualified, capable and the right person to be secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.” Two senior officials said that Jackson’s nomination had been handled “disastrously,” in the words of one, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, and that it had been overshadowed by fights over secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo and CIA director nominee Gina Haspel. In the future, one of these people said, more attention will be put on Jackson. Senior White House officials said Trump was convinced by a coterie of aides, and Jackson, that the accusations were overblown. In the meeting Tuesday afternoon, Jackson offered to withdraw, a senior administration official said, but said he would prefer to push forward. Others present in the meeting included White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, an administration official said. Jackson said the accusations were unfair “and just not true,” a senior administration official said, describing the meeting. Trump later told aides he had already taken a lot of flak for an un­or­tho­dox pick — and didn’t want to give in. “The president gave us the full green light to push back hard,” the official said. Jackson’s nomination also marked the shattering of another norm in Trump’s Washington: VA secretaries have historically been approved unanimously, even sometimes by a voice vote. The president nominated David Shulkin, who had led VA’s health system under Obama, in the tradition of having a bipartisan Cabinet. But he soured on Shulkin and removed him after an inspector’s general report showed that Shulkin took exorbitantly costly trips and misled others about them. There was uncertain congressional support for Jackson, a longtime presidential physician with little management experience, even before questions were raised about his conduct. It was unclear why White House aides had not reviewed the allegations before Jackson was nominated last month. He was picked seemingly on a whim by Trump, who fondly calls him “the Doc” and did not formally interview him before nominating him — and ousting Shulkin — by tweet. Concerns about Jackson were bipartisan. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) remained uncommitted to supporting the nominee, and a number of senior GOP aides on Capitol Hill estimated that his chances of confirmation were slim. Isakson had called Kelly twice in recent days to express concerns about new information, spokeswoman Amanda Maddox said. Isakson and Tester wrote to Trump on Tuesday morning, asking the White House to provide all documents related to Jackson’s service in the White House medical unit as well as all communications between the Pentagon and the White House military office since 2006 that involve allegations or incidents connected to the physician. The senators also requested information the White House has about any allegations involving Jackson that were never relayed to the Pentagon. In addition to Jackson’s lack of management experience at a large organization, the physician had come under fire for his glowing appraisal of Trump’s health after the president had his annual physical in January. Jackson declared that the president might live to the age of 200 with a healthier diet. Isakson said the confirmation hearing is being delayed because the committee needs “some time to get more information.” “I’m concerned that the press is making up far too many stories that aren’t true before we even get a chance to have a meeting,” Isakson said after meeting privately with Tester on Tuesday morning. “So I think Mr. Jackson and myself and Senator Tester and everybody in Congress need to take a deep breath.” A leading veterans group said Tuesday that it was important for the Senate to fully vet a nominee to lead the department, which has had seven secretaries since the start of the war in Afghanistan. “On this critical leadership position at this turbulent time, [the United States] cannot afford a misfire by the White House,” said Paul Rieckhoff, the founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. “IAVA members nationwide are calling on the Senate to do its job at this defining time and ensure that any nominee for VA Secretary will live up to this awesome responsibility.” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), a member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said Trump didn’t take the time to send over a fully vetted nominee. “It is sloppy, it is disrespectful to our veterans, and it is wrong,” Murray said. Emily Wax-Thibodeaux and Mike DeBonis contributed to this report. ||||| (CNN) During an overseas trip in 2015, Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician, was intoxicated and banged on the hotel room door of a female employee, according to four sources familiar with the allegation. The incident became so noisy, one source familiar with the allegation told CNN, that the Secret Service stopped him out of concern that he would wake then-President Barack Obama. Two sources who previously worked in the White House Medical Unit described the same incident, with one former staffer telling CNN that it was \\"definitely inappropriate, in the middle of the night,\\" and that it made the woman uncomfortable. At the time, the incident was reported up the chain of command, and it is one of multiple drunken episodes involving Jackson on overseas trips, according to a source familiar. Members of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee have been working through all of the allegations, but have not substantiated the claims, with little documentation available to corroborate them. Read More ||||| The concern over Dr. Jackson’s nomination is bipartisan and emerged after Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee interviews with more than 20 people, including current and former military personnel who had worked with him. The committee began an investigation last week into Dr. Jackson’s White House work record, and its Republican and Democratic leaders jointly announced Tuesday that his confirmation hearing, planned for Wednesday, would be postponed indefinitely “in light of new information presented to the committee.” “We take very seriously our constitutional duty to thoroughly and carefully vet each nominee sent to the Senate for confirmation,” said Senators Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the committee chairman, and Jon Tester of Montana, its top Democrat, in a joint statement. “We will continue looking into these serious allegations.” Dr. Jackson, speaking with reporters on Capitol Hill before meeting with a Republican senator Tuesday afternoon, gave no indication that he would withdraw his nomination. He also did not answer questions about the accusations. But he added, “I’m looking forward to getting it rescheduled and answering everybody’s questions.” Members of Mr. Tester’s staff said that they had been given several credible accounts of Dr. Jackson being intoxicated during official White House travel. In several cases, they said, he had apparently grabbed his medical bag and was “attempting to assert himself,” to show he was in charge. On one trip during Barack Obama’s presidency, White House staff needed to reach Dr. Jackson for medical reasons and found him passed out in his hotel room after a night of drinking, Tester aides said. The staff members took the medical supplies they were looking for without waking Dr. Jackson. |||||Summary:","completion":"The White House is supporting Ronny L.

She repeatedly taunts and insults him over this, which finally results in him killing her by stomping her brutally in a bathtub, then throwing a radio in the water which was plugged into the wall socket. Sledge burns down the house, then tries to pin the murder on Clint. Clint claims being in the pub all night, but SuperHaji has her revenge on him (from insulting her breast size earlier) by refusing to confirm his alibi. Clint is then forced to flee.In his rush to escape, Clint hitchhikes a ride from a man (John LaZar) and his girlfriend SuperCherry (Colleen Brennan). During the drive, SuperCherry comes on to him and puts his hand over her breast, but then pulls it back. She then tries to give him a handjob over his pants, but he continues to resist her advances. The driver takes offense to Clint rejecting his girlfriend, but she says he probably just wants a closer contact. She again attempts and fails to seduce him and he asks the driver to let him get out. The driver follows him out and beats and robs him. Clint is found by an old farmer who takes him to his farm to heal from his injuries and Clint agrees to work for the farmer for a week to...

The regulation of blood sugar levels is controlled by the hormones insulin and glucagon, produced by the pancreas. When blood sugar levels drop, glucagon is released, causing the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the blood, thereby restoring blood sugar levels.

Ms Baffoni sacked in June 2012.","completion":"Title: Teacher Loses Her Job After Knife Comment at School Once upon a time, there was a 32-year-old teacher named Jacqueline Baffoni. She worked at a school in a big city called Manhattan. Ms. Baffoni had a special knife that she loved to use to cut and slice fruits. She liked to eat healthy snacks during her breaks and loved sharing fruits with her friends. She decided to keep that knife in her desk drawer at school, so she could cut the fruits more easily. One day, while she was teaching a class full of eighth-grade students, some kids in the class didn't want to listen to Ms. Baffoni. They kept talking and making noise, not paying attention to what the teacher was saying. It made her feel very upset and frustrated. Ms. Baffoni wanted the kids to listen and behave well, so she decided to use a strong example. She told the students, \\"I feel like stabbing some of these kids - I have a knife here.\\" She thought the kids would be scared and start listening to her, but she didn't really mean that she would hurt anyone. But, talking about stabbing kids was not a good or safe thing to say. When someone heard about her words, they got worried and told the school leaders. It is important for everyone to feel safe and happy at school, including kids and teachers. Saying such scary things can make people feel worried and not safe. Due to her comment, Ms. Baffoni was not allowed to be a teacher at that school anymore. In June 2012, the school decided to let her go, which means she was sacked, or she had to leave her job. The story of Ms. Baffoni reminds us that it is vital to use kind and gentle words, especially when talking to young kids.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that completed Hope relatively quickly? , can you please find it? Hope is traditionally considered by Christians as a theological virtue (a virtue associated with the grace of God, rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless. In late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that...","completion":"The article never mentions the name of the person who completed Hope relatively quickly.

Q: Question: what is the term used to describe a period o high anti- Communist feelings in the US? Would \\"Anti-communists question the validity of the Marxist claim that the socialist state will \\"wither away\\" when it becomes unnecessary in a true communist society.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"No, your statement \\"Anti-communists question the validity of the Marxist claim that the socialist state will 'wither away' when it becomes unnecessary in a true communist society\\" would not be considered as a reasonable answer to your primary question. The term used to describe a period of high anti-Communist feelings in the US is known as \\"The Red Scare\\". There were two Red Scare periods: the first occurred in the years following World War I (around 1919-1920) and the second, also known as \\"McCarthyism\\", in the years following World War II (around 1947-1957). The term \\"Red Scare\\" is used to denote the widespread fear and panic about potential rise and influence of communists (often associated with the color red) in the United States. This fear became quite intense that it influenced the social, political, and cultural sides of society. People feared that communists were infiltrating American institutions with the aim of overthrowing the US government. These tensions were further ignited by events such as the Russian 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and the later expansion of the Soviet Union post World War II. In the second Red Scare, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy became the public face of the anti-communist crusade in the United States. He alleged that communists were prevalent within the government and other institutions, though his attempts to expose them were often inconclusive. In contrast, your statement about anti-communists questioning the Marxist claim addresses anti-communist sentiment in a general sense. It refers to a criticism of communist theory rather than referring to a specific period marked by intensive anti-communist sentiment in the United States. While this would be part of the reasoning of people against communism, it doesn't necessarily describe the social, political and cultural hysteria during the two Red Scare periods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's break down the sentences and highlight the similarities and differences to understand the disparity in their meanings. Sentence 1: Magda Lorne learns from her supervisor, Cholayna Ares, that a Terran operative, Alexis Anders, has survived a plane crash in the Hellers a week earlier. Sentence 2: Alexis Anders learns from her supervisor, Cholayna Ares, that a Terran agent, Magda Lorne, has survived a plane crash in the Hellers a week earlier. Similarities: 1. Both sentences involve the exchange of information between a supervisor and their subordinates. 2. The supervisor in both sentences is Cholayna Ares. 3. The fact that someone has survived a plane crash in the Hellers a week earlier is the central shared information. 4. Both sentences involve Terran individuals, either termed as an operative or agent. Differences: 1. The subject of the first sentence is Magda Lorne, meaning that she is the one who learns the information from her supervisor. In contrast, the subject of the second sentence is Alexis Anders who learns the information. 2. In the first sentence, the Terran operative who survived the plane crash is Alexis Anders. Conversely, in the second sentence, the Terran agent who survived the crash is Magda Lorne. Taking these points into consideration, the first sentence focuses on Magda Lorne learning that Alexis Anders survived a plane crash. The second sentence, however, is about Alexis Anders receiving information that Magda Lorne survived the crash.

It is set in 91 BCE, when Lucius Licinius Crassus dies, just before the Social War and the civil war between Marius and Sulla, during which Marcus Antonius Orator, the other great orator of this dialogue, dies. During this year, the author faces a difficult political situation: after his return from exile in Dyrrachium (modern Albania), his house was destroyed by the gangs of Clodius in a time when violence was common. This was intertwined with the street politics of Rome. - Lucius Licinius Crassus ( 140 BC -- 91 BC ) was a Roman consul . He was considered the greatest Roman orator of his day , by his pupil Cicero . He became consul in 95 BC. During his consulship a law was passed ( the lex Licinia Mucia ) requiring all but citizens to leave Rome , an edict which provoked the Social War . In 92 BC he was elected censor with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus . Licinius Crassus was married to Mucia Tertia , younger daughter of the Consul Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur by his wife Laelia , daughter of Gaius Laelius Sapiens . They had two surviving children : Licinia Crassa Prima or Major married to the Praetor of 93 BC , Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica , the son of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio and descendant of Scipio Africanus and Scipio Nasica , and by whom she had issue Licinia Crassa Secunda or Minor , who married Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius , eventually Pontifex Maximus who adopted Licinia Crassa Major 's son , who then became known as Metellus Scipio . According to both Plutarch and Cicero , a Licinia , daughter of this man , was married to Gaius Marius the Younger . The marriage may have taken place around 95 BC , though the date is pure supposition by scholars , based on the known political alliance between the two fathers ( Crassus and Gaius Marius ) , the fact that men could not marry before they turned 14 , but that leading families tended to marry early to cement alliances . Nothing is known of Licinia after Marius the Younger 's death in 82 BC , although in the time of Caesar Amatius , a Pseudo-Marius , appeared in Rome claiming to be their son - Cicero seems to have accepted the possibility that he might indeed be a Marius , though he tried not to involve himself in a politically difficult situation . He is also noted by Cicero in De Oratore that Licinius Crassus was a friend of Marcus Vigellius . - Marcus Tullius Cicero ( \\"Kikern\\"; 3 January 106 BC 7 December 43 BC) was a Roman philosopher, politician, lawyer, orator, political theorist, consul, and constitutionalist. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists. - Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix (c. 138 BC 78 BC), known commonly as Sulla, was a Roman general and statesman. He had the distinction of holding the office of consul twice, as well as reviving the dictatorship. Sulla was awarded a grass crown, the most prestigious Roman military honor, during the Social War. Sulla was a skillful general, achieving numerous successes in wars against different opponents, both foreign and Roman. His life was habitually included in the ancient biographical collections of leading generals and politicians, originating in the biographical compendium of famous Romans published by Marcus Terentius Varro.

Answer:","completion":"The common denominator between both Disney films, Cars and Planes, in terms of writers, is John Lasseter. John Lasseter is an American animator, film director, screenwriter, and producer who is widely known for his work at Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios. John Lasseter was the chief creative officer at Pixar, where he directed and played a significant role in producing popular animated films like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Cars. As the director and a co-writer, Lasseter was influential in shaping the storylines and characters of these films. Released in 2006, Disney and Pixar's Cars was conceived by Lasseter and features the story of a race car named Lightning McQueen and his journey of self-discovery and friendship. The film was a massive success and led to two sequels, Cars 2 and Cars 3, as well as numerous spin-offs and merchandise. Although John Lasseter was not directly involved in the writing process for the 2013 DisneyToon Studios film Planes, he was credited as executive producer and contributed creatively to the project. Planes is a spin-off of the Cars franchise, and both films share the same universe – a world where vehicles are anthropomorphized and have their personalities and emotions. The vibrant world, memorable characters, and heartwarming stories of friendship, determination, and self-discovery in both Cars and Planes films owe much of their conception and development to John Lasseter's creative direction and influence. In conclusion, John Lasseter is the common denominator between the Disney films Cars and Planes, as he played a significant role in creating the storylines, characters, and world-building in both film franchises. As a director, writer, and creative mind at Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, Lasseter has had a lasting impact on the world of animation and storytelling."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Worst experience I've had at a restaurant in quite awhile. I understand that it was their first day open, but it was a disaster to say the least. I had high hopes of going to this restaurant because they had gluten free pizza & because I have celiac disease, I rarely get to indulge in such luxury items. I walked into The Rusty Onion with very high hopes. My mom finally had a day where she could meet me for lunch, so not only was I excited to try something new, I was excited to spend some quality time with her. Needless to say, our time was spent bickering and complaining about the lack of service we received at this restaurant. When we sat down our waitress came to greet us and she was 'less than pleasant'. She never brought us our drinks and we had to ask nearly 4 other servers if we could get a simple tea & water. After this 'fiasco', we had to ask a few other servers for straws. 30 minutes go by and we still had yet to receive our food. Like most average people of the area, we do not have 2-3 hour lunch breaks, so timing is everything. As time began to slip away, my mother and I had to ask to see a manager. The manager told us that they were very 'backed up' despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't even a forth of the way full. Everyone around us was either angry or getting up & leaving at this point. As you could probably guess, my mom and I had to leave when I had 15 minutes left of my lunch break. So not only did I leave angry, I left very hungry. The manger did however ask if we wanted 'to go' drinks. Apparently a 'to go' water was supposed to appease the situation. I assure you, it did not.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Determine the sentiment: Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) gets out of reform school and goes back to the slums. His sister (Ann Sheridan) does her best to keep him out of trouble, but it just seems to follow him. Aside from his associations with the Termite gang, Gabe is followed by real-life gangsters who have a scheme to set fire to random buildings to collect the insurance. They need someone to blame for the arson, and Gabe is it. It is up to the Termites to work the law in their favor and give the gangsters their just desserts. The the scene that introduces the Dead End Kids is really quite good. The boys wander on over to the new resident's furniture on the street, and proceed to make it their own. They talk to each other in phoney posh accents and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap in a chair. The boys then proceed to start a fight with the new boy, but after he proves himself a good fighter, they ask him to join their club. The initiation scene is rather good too, filled with mischief that seems dangerous at first, but is really rather clever and innocent. Later, when Billy Halop studies to become the boy mayor, he has a dream about schoolwork. This is wonderfully staged, with tiny holograms of the kids walking on his face and firing questions at him. Angels Wash Their Faces is a great title because it plays off of the success of Angels With Dirty Faces, and really tells what the kids are doing. Notorious for bad behavior on and off the set, these boys make nice in this film. But rather than seem disingenuous, it makes for some great laughs. This is a preview of what many of the boys would become in The Bowery Boys series.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Problem:Question: Klindworth took up the position of professor of pianoforte at a conservatory in what country? Passage 1:In 1854 Klindworth went to London, where he remained for fourteen years, studying, teaching and occasionally appearing in public. From London Klindworth went to Moscow in 1868, following Nikolai Rubinstein's invitation to take up the position of professor of pianoforte at the Moscow Conservatory, where he first met Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as professor of harmony. While in Russia he completed his pianoforte arrangements for Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, which he had commenced during Wagner's visit to England in 1855, Beethoven's sonatas and also his critical edition of Frédéric Chopin's works. He then became conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1882, in association with Joseph Joachim and Franz Wüllner, being also the conductor of the Berlin Wagner Society. At this time, he established the Klindworths Musikschule, which later became the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory. Passage 2:Kevin Francis (born June 5, 1993) is a professional Canadian football linebacker for the Ottawa Redblacks of the Canadian Football League (CFL). After going undrafted in the 2016 NFL draft, Francis declared eligible for the 2016 CFL Supplemental Draft after informing the league that he was born in Toronto, Ontario. He was drafted by the Roughriders on May 26, 2016, who forfeited a third round selection in the 2017 CFL Draft to acquire his rights. Upon entering 2016 training camp, Francis switched to the defensive side of the ball after playing as a tight end during his college football career with the North Carolina A&T Aggies. He made his CFL debut on June 30, 2016 against the Toronto Argonauts, registering his first defensive tackle. Francis finished his rookie season leading the team in special team tackles, also being ranked 7 on the CFL rising sophomore list Passage 3:Løvenkrands found himself out of the team for the away draw with Leicester City and remained on the bench. New signing Leon Best was then selected ahead of Løvenkrands for the fixture at St James' Park against Cardiff City. Løvenkrands replaced Best after 60 minutes, and he went on to score the fourth and fifth goals of the game in an emphatic 5–1 win for Newcastle. He scored the winning goal for Newcastle in their last game of their successful season against Queens Park Rangers finishing off a successful season for both Løvenkrands and Newcastle. He did not start Newcastle's opening Premier League games, starting on the bench. He played alongside Shola Ameobi in a 3–2 away win against Accrington Stanley in the League Cup. He got his first goal of the season there, scoring the winner with a close range acrobatic volley. After a brief substitute appearance against Blackpool, he started in Newcastle's 4–3 away win against Chelsea, also in the League Cup. He scored the only goal in the 3–1 defeat to West Brom. With Carroll injured throughout January, Løvenkrands had a successful month, scoring once in a 5–0 win over West Ham and playing well a week earlier against Wigan Athletic. After the sale of Carroll to Liverpool in January, Løvenkrands gained more opportunities up front along with the likes of Leon Best and Nile Ranger. He rekindled his partnership with Best upon the injury of Ameobi in February, and Løvenkrands scored in a 2–0 victory over Birmingham City on 15 February. He continued as a regular striker until the end of the season as Best picked up an ankle injury. He ended his season by scoring in a 3–3 draw with West Bromwich Albion.

They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction. Direct current is what is used in devices like flashlights. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions.

Continue writing the following text. At the beach, Angela was more prone to sunburn than Elena because Pick from: I. Angela had applied sunblock quite liberally.; II. Elena had applied sunblock quite liberally.;","completion":"At the beach, Angela was more prone to sunburn than Elena because Elena had applied sunblock quite liberally. Although both friends had been looking forward to this beach day for weeks, their individual approaches to sun protection ended up having quite different outcomes. Elena, always cautious and meticulous, had taken the time to research the best sunscreens available on the market for their skin types. Picking one that offered broad-spectrum protection with an SPF of 50, she made sure to apply it generously on all exposed areas of her body, including her face, neck, shoulders, and legs. On top of that, she decided to reapply the sunblock every two hours, adhering to the recommended guidelines from dermatologists. Angela, on the other hand, was more carefree about sun protection. Though she did apply some sunblock before leaving for the beach, it wasn't the same high-quality sunscreen Elena had chosen. With an SPF of only 30, Angela applied it sparingly, missing some crucial areas like the back of her neck and the tops of her feet. Additionally, as the day went on, Angela simply forgot to reapply the sunscreen, leaving her skin largely unprotected from the sun's relentless rays. The two friends enjoyed their beach day, but as the hours passed under the scorching sun, the consequences of their differing sun protection methods became clearer. Angela's skin began to redden from the sunburn, while Elena's remained relatively unscathed. Surprised by the stark contrast in their experiences, the two friends discussed their respective sunscreen habits and what they could learn from each other. Elena's broad-spectrum SPF 50 sunscreen proved to be far more effective in shielding her skin from sunburn, while her thorough application technique and diligent reapplication schedule further enhanced its effects. This contrasted with Angela's more laid-back approach, which resulted in less protection overall and a higher likelihood of sunburn. From this experience, Angela recognized the importance of choosing a high-quality, high-SPF sunscreen that offered broad-spectrum protection to safeguard against both UVA and UVB rays. Additionally, she learned the value of applying sunscreen generously and frequently throughout the day. Going forward, Angela resolved to be more attentive to her sun protection habits, and Elena appreciated the reminder of just how crucial this seemingly small aspect of a beach day could be in preserving their skin's long-term health. As they made their way back home, the friends pledged to make sun protection a priority, ensuring that their future beach days would be enjoyable without undue sunburn. With their newfound knowledge in hand, Angela and Elena looked forward to many relaxing beachside vacations, confident in their shared commitment to taking care of their skin as well as their relationship with the sun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

Yesterday, they conducted there tests, test A, test B, and test C. In test A, John kept a substance in solid state, but Keith changed the same substance from solid to liquid state. In test B, John conducted a chemical reaction in low temperature, but Keith conducted the same chemical reaction in high temperature. Finally, in test C, John kept an unstable material in room temperature, but Keith kept the same unstable material in a cool container. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In test A, whose substance would have higher temperature, John or Keith? Hint: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. Answer:","completion":"In test A, Keith's substance would have a higher temperature. The reason for this is that temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter, and when a substance changes from solid to liquid, it indicates an increase in the temperature of the material. This means that Keith had to increase the temperature of the substance to change its state from solid to liquid. Meanwhile, John kept the substance in its solid state, which suggests that he did not provide the necessary energy to increase its temperature. Therefore, between John and Keith's substances in test A, Keith's substance would have a higher temperature as he changed it from solid to liquid state."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Detroit got on the board early with a T.J. Duckett 11-yard TD run and a safety off a blocked Dustin Colquitt punt. In the second quarter, the Lions opened up a 19-0 lead with a Jason Hanson field goal and a Paris Lenon interception return for a touchdown. Kansas City fought back with a Jackie Battle 3-yard run and a 1-yard pass from Damon Huard to Jared Allen to make it 19-14, but the Lions' Jason Hanson added two more field goals in the second half and the Chiefs could not convert a two-point conversion to Tony Gonzalez in the 3rd after a Dwayne Bowe receiving TD. Detroit held Kansas City off 25-20, ending their long skid. With the win, the Lions improved to 7-8, 5-3 at home.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding.

They have evidence that an unknown flying craft crashed in their vicinity, so Reporter Ned Scott (Douglas Spencer) tags along for the story. Dr. Carrington later briefs Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) and his airmen, and Dr. Redding (George Fenneman) shows photos of a flying object moving erratically before crashing; not the movements of a meteorite. Following erratic magnetic pole anomalies, the crew and scientists fly to the crash site aboard the team's C-47. The mysterious craft lies buried beneath refrozen ice, with just the tip of a rounded airfoil protruding from the surface. As they outline the craft's general shape, they realize they are standing in a circle: they have discovered a crashed flying saucer. They try deicing the buried craft with thermite heat bombs, but only ignite its metal alloy, causing an explosion that destroys the saucer. Their Geiger counter then points to a slightly radioactive frozen shape buried nearby in the refrozen ice. They excavate a large block of ice around what appears to be a tall body and fly it to the research outpost, just as a major storm moves in, cutting off their communications with Anchorage. Some of the scientists want to thaw out the body, but Captain Hendry issues orders for everyone to wait until he receives further instructions from the Air Force. Later, Corporal Barnes (William Self) takes the second watch over the ice block and to avoid looking at the body within, covers it with an electric blanket that the previous guard left turned on. As the ice slowly melts, the Thing inside revives; Barnes panics and begins shooting at it with his .45 caliber sidearm, but the alien escapes into the sub-zero cold of the raging storm.

Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death.

During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for President. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic Incumbent President Kellogg and Republican U.S. Senator Mills.A parallel plot follows Eleanor (played by Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices an error in the voting system, but the head of the company purposefully ignores her warnings. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously - perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, where, fed up with the posturing of the other candidates, he shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains in a distant third to Kellogg and Mills.Election Day arrives and polls show Dobbs at 17% with Kellogg and Mills tied in the 40s. Dobbs performs better than expected, although not well enough to be close to either of the two major candidates. Early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere. Eleanor says that this is part of the error in the voting systems. Then all of a sudden Dobbs starts winning states. He first wins in Virginia, then North Carolina, and then big states such as...

Ned studied more about predators, while Kim studied more about herbivores. But I can use this background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. What is an answer for this question: Which student studied more about keystone species?

Here is an article: NEW DELHI — I was talking last week to a senior official from the Congress Party in one of the capital’s colonial bungalows that are a much-envied perk of power when news arrived that the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (D.M.K.), a party from the southern state of Tamil Nadu and an important partner in Congress’s ruling alliance, had withdrawn support from the government. The functionary was gleeful. That reaction surprised me, but less so than the explanation for it: “There goes Chidambaram’s chance of becoming prime minister.” The reference was to the finance minister, whose parliamentary seat from Tamil Nadu depends on continued support from D.M.K. Even assuming that, against current odds, Congress does well in the 2014 general election and then Rahul Gandhi chooses not to become prime minister, P. Chidambaram could hardly claim India’s top post without winning his own election. That this Congress politician would delight at an ally’s setback sums up the atmosphere of cynicism that permeates Indian politics today. Then again, D.M.K.’s withdrawal was cynical to being with. For years the party, which has its roots in a Tamil separatist movement, had done little to take up the cause of the Tamils in Sri Lanka. But faced with plummeting support in its home state over allegations of corruption, it has recently tried to rebrand itself. Sensing an opportunity after a recent U.N. resolution on Sri Lanka calling for “an independent and credible investigation into alleged war crimes” committed against Tamils during the civil war that ended in 2009, the chief of the D.M.K. reportedly said that “India’s failure to understand the gravity of the situation and its indifference” were “antidemocratic.” Hence the party’s withdrawal from the government. Now that the D.M.K. is out, India’s ruling alliance can be held hostage by any one of its remaining partners. With barely a majority in Parliament, Congress is desperate for the continued support of the Samajwadi Party (which rules India’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh), the Bahujan Samaj Party (which represents the dalits), and the Trinamool Congress (a breakaway faction of Congress that rules the state of West Bengal). And they know it. In 2011, for example, the Indian government had to give up on a water-sharing agreement with Bangladesh because the Trinamool Congress opposed it, alleging it would take too much fresh water away from West Bengal. And six months ago the party withdrew from the government over proposed cuts to India’s burgeoning subsidies. But then just this month, reacting to the Sri Lankan Tamil issue, the Trinamool Congress’s leader said that when it comes to India’s external affairs “our party never interferes” with the central government’s policies. She seemed to have been positioning the Trinamool Congress for some of the spoils left by D.M.K.’s departure. Congress’s response to feeling hamstrung has been no less cynical. Among other things, it has used the Central Bureau of Investigation, the agency responsible for monitoring major corruption cases, as a political tool. A few years ago, it appointed Ashwani Kumar — who once oversaw security for Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi (of Congress) and his wife Sonia Gandhi (now the head of Congress) — as chief of the investigation bureau. And after President Pranab Mukherjee (Congress again) appointed Kumar to be governor of the state of Nagaland, Congress replaced Kumar with another hand-picked candidate. No wonder, then, that within days of D.M.K.’s withdrawal from the government the Central Bureau of Investigation raided the house of M.K. Stalin, the son of the D.M.K.’s leader and its heir apparent. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s attempt to distance himself from the raid only heightened suspicions about its motivations: Congress appears to be warning not only the D.M.K., but all its other nominal allies, to stay put. In the cynical political atmosphere that dominates India today, perhaps these parties deserve one another. The question is whether the country deserves them.

Frog X was found in a pond in the forest and has a parasite in it. Frog Y was found just outside the laboratory and is missing one eye. The employees at the lab weren't planning on analyzing any frogs, but when they found the one outside their front door they changed their mind. Which frog will have more tissue broken down? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, we need to consider the factors affecting tissue breakdown in both frogs and make an informed comparison. Let's break this down step by step. Step 1: Evaluate the condition of Frog X Frog X was found in a pond in the forest and has a parasite. The presence of a parasite can potentially lead to tissue damage in the frog, depending on the type and severity of the parasitic infection. The parasite can cause inflammation, destroy tissue, and lead to overall poor health in the frog. Step 2: Evaluate the condition of Frog Y Frog Y was found just outside the laboratory and is missing one eye. The missing eye suggests that this frog has experienced physical trauma or injury that led to tissue damage. However, we have no information about any ongoing factors that could contribute to continued tissue breakdown in Frog Y. Step 3: Compare the tissue breakdown in both frogs Comparing the tissue breakdown in both frogs, we can observe the following: - Frog X has a parasite that could potentially cause ongoing tissue damage. - Frog Y has already experienced tissue damage due to the missing eye but currently doesn't have any other known factors contributing to continued tissue breakdown. Based on this comparison, it is more likely that Frog X will have more tissue broken down due to the parasite's ongoing effects on its body.

The sight of people wearing masks became common in Hong Kong after the SARS outbreak of 2003. \\"Seeing the people in masks today reminds me of Hong Kong during SARS,\\" said Lo, an epidemiology expert who was among those on the frontline during the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong in 2003, which within three months infected 8,000 and killed nearly 800 in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Toronto. Historically, Hong Kong has been center stage for recent infections that threatened to spiral across the world, such as SARS and Avian Influenza, which first struck and killed people here in 1997. For example, in the case of","completion":"SARS, Hong Kong implemented strict measures, such as quarantine, travel restrictions, and enhanced hygiene practices, which eventually helped bring the situation under control. As a result of these experiences, Hong Kong has become a prime example of how to effectively deal with and contain potentially global pandemics. In the story, as the news from Mexico unfolds, Dr. Lo is continually reminded of the lessons learned from past pandemics in Hong Kong and hopes to share his expertise with other countries facing similar challenges. He understands the importance of collaboration and coordination in combating these threats, recognizing that no nation can fight these battles alone. As the story nears its conclusion, the outbreak in Mexico intensifies, leading to a spike in global anxiety. Governments worldwide closely monitor the situation, taking preventive measures to reduce the potential spread of the disease and leaning on Dr. Lo's expertise to guide their efforts. His previous experiences with SARS and Avian Influenza have positioned him as a valuable global resource in the field of epidemiology. A turning point arrives when Dr. Lo, partnering with international health organizations and experts, successfully identifies the cause of the outbreak in Mexico. This crucial information then leads to the development and distribution of a treatment protocol that drastically reduces the death rate and curtails the spread of the disease. Simultaneously, authorities implement stricter travel restrictions, public health awareness campaigns, and mass vaccination initiatives to protect the global population. The story ultimately ends with the situation in Mexico improving significantly, as the number of infections and deaths continues to decrease. The global community has once again avoided a catastrophic pandemic. Dr. Lo's experience, knowledge, and guidance play a key role in this victory. His tireless efforts to share his expertise truly helped to save countless lives. As nations worldwide recover, they vow to learn from this experience, just as Hong Kong did with SARS and Avian Influenza. Governments collaborate on establishing international protocols for pandemic preparedness and response, ensuring that lessons from this outbreak are not forgotten and the world is better prepared for future threats. The theme of the story revolves around the importance of international cooperation, the value of experience, and the necessity of vigilance in the face of potential pandemics. Dr. Lo's journey serves as a reminder that we must be proactive in our efforts to identify and address public health challenges and work together across borders in order to create a healthier, safer world for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, we can subtract 77a from both sides: 82a - 77a = 77a - 77a + 35 This simplifies to: 5a = 35 Step 3: Solve for 'a' Now, we just need to solve for 'a'.

The business produced little enough for him, but Bill was a man who only wanted the simplicity and order and regularity of the job. He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock. Every day he opened his shop at six a.m. to catch the early trade; the papers arrived on his door-step before that. Many of Bill's customers were city workers, and the shop was convenient for the station. Business was _ by 10 o'clock, so at eleven sharp Bill closed for lunch.

First question: Why do you think Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump? Second question: What were the biggest reasons Hillary Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump, for the presidency? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, both questions are essentially asking the same thing. They seek to examine the reasons behind Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential elections to Donald Trump. Here's a detailed answer analyzing why Hillary Clinton lost the election. 1. Populist mood: The 2016 election took place against the backdrop of a resurgent populist mood in the US. This was characterized by frustration with the establishment and a desire for change. Trump, as a political outsider, was able to tap into this sentiment more effectively than Clinton, who was widely seen as part of the establishment. 2. Economic anxiety: Many voters, particularly in the Rust Belt states, felt left behind by globalization and the decline of manufacturing jobs in the US. Trump's protectionist messages on trade and immigration resonated with this demographic, while Clinton's support for international trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) made her appear out-of-touch with their concerns. 3. Uneven focus on swing states: Clinton's campaign was criticized for its overconfidence and lack of attention to swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Trump's campaign focused much of its efforts on these areas and was ultimately able to flip them, securing the electoral college victory. 4. The email scandal: Throughout her campaign, Clinton was dogged by the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State. The issue was compounded when then-FBI director James Comey announced the reopening of the investigation into her emails just days before the election. This raised concerns about her trustworthiness and contributed to a negative perception of her among some voters. 5. Perceived lack of authenticity: Clinton was often seen as inauthentic and overly scripted, which made it difficult for her to connect with voters on an emotional level. In contrast, Trump was seen as more genuine and unfiltered, even if his statements were sometimes controversial. 6. Russian interference: There is evidence that Russian entities interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump and hurt Clinton. This includes hacking the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server, releasing sensitive emails through WikiLeaks, and spreading disinformation through social media platforms. 7. The role of the media: The media's coverage of the election has been criticized for its emphasis on sensationalism and \\"horse-race\\" journalism, at the expense of substantive policy discussion. This may have contributed to Trump's ability to dominate headlines with his provocative statements and stunts. 8. Gender dynamics: As the first female major-party nominee in US history, Clinton faced a unique set of challenges related to sexism and gendered expectations. Some voters may have been uncomfortable with the idea of a female president, while others may have judged her more harshly because of her gender. In summary, there were numerous factors that contributed to Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 election. These included the overarching populist sentiment, economic concerns, campaigning missteps, the email scandal, perceived lack of authenticity, Russian interference, the media's role, and gender dynamics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With the help of a police woman named Sam, can Mordrid defeat his evil brother? \\"Dr. Mordrid\\" comes to me courtesy of Charles Band in the Full Moon Archive Collection. I had not heard of it, which is a bit odd given that I'm a big fan of Jeffrey Combs (Mordrid) and the film isn't that old. But now it's mine and I can enjoy it again and again. The film certainly is fun in the classic Full Moon style. Richard Band provides the music (which doesn't differ much from all his other scores) and Brian Thompson plays the evil Kabal. We even have animated dinosaur bones! What more do you want? Of course, the cheese factor is high. I felt much of the film was a rip-off of the Dr. Strange comics. And the blue pantsuit was silly. And plot holes are everywhere (I could list at least five, but why bother). And why does the ancient symbol of Mordrid and Kabal look suspiciously like a hammer and sickle? Combs has never been a strong actor, so he fits right in with the cheese. These aren't complaints. Full Moon fans have come to expect these things and devour them like crack-laced Grape Nuts.

Given the question: I can use this background: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. Now, I have a new situation: The city of Lampo is currently experiencing some soil piping in the ground. The government officials of Lampo are currently looking to start a casino to bring in extra revenue to the town. They are currently consulting with a company that is located in Himpton, a city that is not experiencing soil piping. The company is a well respected leader in the casino industry and is eager to work with Lampo. Answer this question please: Are sink holes more or less likely to form in Lampo? The answer is:","completion":"Sinkholes are more likely to form in Lampo due to the ongoing soil piping issue in the city. Soil piping is known to cause the formation of sinkholes as it involves the subsurface erosion of soil, weakening the stability of the ground above it. As water flows through the soil, it removes particles and creates underground channels or pipes that eventually lead to the collapse of the overlying soil layers, forming a sinkhole. The city of Lampo is already experiencing soil piping, which indicates that the conditions are conducive to sinkhole formation. The addition of a casino could further exacerbate this problem, particularly during the construction phase, as the heavy machinery and additional load placed on the ground could disturb the underground soil structure, leading to a higher possibility of sinkholes. In contrast, Himpton, the city where the casino company is located, is not experiencing soil piping. Consequently, the risk of sinkhole formation there would likely be lower compared to Lampo. However, it is essential to evaluate each city's geological and environmental factors independently, as sinkholes can occur due to various reasons such as natural geological processes, human activities, and other factors like soil composition, groundwater levels, and land use patterns. Considering the situation in Lampo, it would be highly advisable for the government officials and the casino company to conduct a thorough geotechnical investigation and risk assessment before initiating the project. This will help identify potential sinkhole hazards and implement necessary mitigation measures to minimize risks and ensure safety. Moreover, it would also be crucial to address and rectify any contributing factors such as soil salination and groundwater management in the area, as these can also play a role in sinkhole development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His sole head coaching position was for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1969 to 1991. When Noll retired after 23 years, only three other head coaches in NFL history had longer tenures with one team. After a six-year playing career that included two NFL Championships as a member of his hometown Cleveland Browns, and several years as an assistant coach with various teams, in 1969 Noll took the helm of the then moribund Steelers (which had played in only one post-season game in its previous 36 years, a 21-0 loss), and turned it into a perennial contender. Context: Noll's legacy includes providing opportunities for African Americans. Under Noll, Joe Gilliam became the league's first African American starting quarterback just a few seasons after the AFL started Marlin Briscoe, and James Harris (Gilliam started ahead of Terry Bradshaw briefly during the 1974 season). In 1975, Franco Harris became the first African American to win the Super Bowl MVP award. During the 1980s, Tony Dungy (who briefly played under Noll in the late 1970s) got his start as an NFL assistant coach, initially as the Steelers' Defensive Backs Coach, and later he became the first African-American Coordinator in the NFL. Noll strongly promoted Dungy as a well-qualified head coaching candidate, but it did not happen for Dungy with the Steelers when Noll retired after the 1991 season. However Dungy did become head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later became the first African American coach to win a Super Bowl (XLI) with the Indianapolis Colts. On August 2, 2007, the field at St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania was dedicated and renamed Chuck Noll Field in honor of the former coach. For more than 40 years the Steelers have held their summer camp at St. Vincent College, as it was Noll's idea to take the team away from the distractions in the city to prepare for the season each year. Chuck Noll was honored on October 7, 2007 at Heinz Field during the pre-game ceremonies. On September 30, 2011, Pittsburgh honored Noll by naming a new street after him. Chuck Noll Way connects North Shore Drive to West General Robinson St. The street runs along Stage AE, on the North Shore of Pittsburgh. Question: What was his legacy? Answer:","completion":"Chuck Noll's legacy is a multifaceted and significant one, encompassing various aspects of the National Football League (NFL) and the broader sports sphere. As a transformative figure in American football, Noll's impact can be felt through his success as a head coach, his commitment to racial equality and diversity, and his influence on other successful coaches who carried on his values. 1. Revitalizing the Pittsburgh Steelers: Noll aided in reshaping the Steelers from a struggling franchise into a championship-winning team. Under Noll's leadership, the Steelers won four Super Bowl championships (IX, X, XIII, and XIV) and became a dominant force in the NFL during the 1970s.

Another, 13-year-old Thor Wilink, said he rushed from his home to help when he heard screams and someone yelling, \\"Help, please God, save me.\\" \\"After that, I heard, 'Does anyone have rope and a lapel?' and I know because I go to Yosemite, so I grabbed that, went down to the cliffs, and started to untangle the rope,\\" he said. That's when fire crews arrived. \\"I only had one priority, to save the person,\\" Thor said. \\"I only had one priority.\\" Thor recalled seeing a woman helping two surfers perform CPR, yelling instructions down at them.

I've seen many, many films and have reviewed a great deal of them, in print. So when I tell you that this film has the single funniest scene I have ever seen in a movie, you might want to listen to me. There's a lot of diversity of opinion as to what makes this INCREDIBLY stupid movie as funny as it is. And to those who just didn't get, well, I can't blame them, too much. The scene I speak of, comes at about the 30 minute mark and involves a dead convict shackled to John Candy. Up until that point, I had found the film dumb, confusing and it was beginning to lose me. When this scene came up, I laughed so hard, I peed my pants. No movie has ever done that to me before. When the project began, \\"Going Berserk\\" was supposed to be the SCTV movie. I remember it being announced. As time went on, the cast was whittled down To John Candy, Joe Flaherty & Eugene Levy. There also must have been a regime change at Universal, while it was being shot, because upon being released, it was shown in nearly ZERO theaters. When watching this a second time, I listened to the theme song (which actually flaunts how incomprehensible the plot is, in the lyrics), relaxed my logic nerve and figured out what was going on. Aside from the aforementioned routine, \\"Going Berserk\\" has many other hilarious scenes to recommend it. This is almost a 3 Stooges flick, except it's much funnier. Director David Steinberg has razor sharp timing, and he must have been laughing all through this. As for Candy, who's basically in charge here, he has NEVER been funnier. With all the plot devices and explanatory scenes thrown out the window, he absolutely runs wild. Flaherty and Levy follow him effortlessly. There is a plot, but it's a plot like \\"Animal House\\" had a plot, and yeah, the script is uneven, and a little slow to start. Once you know this, however, you can well appreciate the full SCTV style craziness that transpires. It IS stupid, but it's stupid on purpose, and you need to remember that when you see it. DO see it, and discover for yourself, if it has the funniest scene of all time in it.","completion":"I choose 2). positive. Reasoning: Although the text mentions some negative aspects of the film, like it being \\"dumb\\" and \\"confusing,\\" the majority of the review praises its humor, calling it \\"INCREDIBLY stupid\\" (in a positive way), and describes its funniest scene as \\"the single funniest scene I have ever seen in a movie.\\" The reviewer also compliments the director, the cast, and ultimately recommends others to watch the film.

Preparing meals usually consists of cooking and packaging food in advance, so it's readily available for consumption during the work week. Let's briefly look at why the other options aren't suitable: - chew: Chewing is the physical act of breaking down food using teeth after it is consumed, it doesn't correlate with having food ready for the work week. - eating: Eating refers to the act of consuming food, but it doesn't relate to the planning or arrangement of meals ahead of time. - digest: Digest refers to the process occurring inside the body, where nutrients are absorbed from consumed food. It doesn't imply planning or preparing meals in advance. - eat food: This answer is similar to \\"eating,\\" as it refers to the act of consuming food but doesn't include any planning or preparation aspect.

I now only use it for activities where there is minimal walking involved. I would advise not to buy or purchase a half size bigger than your usual size. For wide feet do not purchase at all!!!!! A:","completion":"After analyzing the given product review, the chances of me buying the product would most likely decrease, and here's why: 1. Comfort Issue: The reviewer explicitly states that the shoe is painful to wear and not designed for walking. Comfort is a significant factor when it comes to purchasing footwear. It is essential for the shoe to be comfortable for walking and other daily activities. A product that prioritizes aesthetics over functionality is generally less appealing when compared to an alternative that provides a proper balance between the two. 2. Inflexible Material: The reviewer highlights that the material of the shoe is not flexible and even contains some metal material near the toes. This inflexibility could make the shoe uncomfortable and potentially hazardous for the wearer. Flexible materials are usually preferred in footwear as they can adapt to the natural movement and shape of the foot. 3. Limited Usage: Since the shoe is only suitable for activities with minimal walking involved, it severely limits its usability, making it a less appealing choice. A good product should cater to a wide range of activities and not restrict the user's options. 4. Sizing Issues: The reviewer advises purchasing a half size bigger than one's usual size and warns against buying for people with wide feet. This indicates an issue with sizing and fitting, further decreasing the chances of buying the product. Good footwear should provide a proper fit and accommodate different foot shapes. 5. Multiple Warnings: The reviewer provides a strong caution against purchasing the product and even uses an exclamation to emphasize their warning. This suggests a strong negative experience with the product, which would likely deter potential buyers. In conclusion, the given review would decrease the chances of me buying the product. The reasons mentioned by the reviewer suggest that the product lacks essential features such as comfort, flexibility, and accommodating sizing, making it unappealing and impractical. It is crucial to prioritize useful features alongside aesthetics when purchasing footwear or any product.

I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me. He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with.

Question: who pays for the renovations on holmes next generation?? Answer:","completion":"The renovations on \\"Holmes Next Generation,\\" a home renovation television show, are typically funded through a combination of sources. These sources may include production companies, sponsors, advertisers, homeowners, and various other contributors. Below is a detailed explanation of how the funding comes together to pay for the renovations on the show. 1. Production Company: The production company behind \\"Holmes Next Generation,\\" Make It Right Productions (founded by Mike Holmes, the host of the show), funds a large portion of the renovation costs. The production company receives its funds from various sources like distribution deals with television networks, licensing fees, and other media-related revenues. 2. Television Networks: The networks that air \\"Holmes Next Generation,\\" such as DIY Network in the United States and HGTV in Canada, contribute to the funding of the renovations. The networks earn revenue from advertising during the show's broadcast and license fees from distribution to other networks or streaming platforms around the world. A portion of this revenue is allocated to the production of the show, including the renovation costs. 3. Sponsors and Advertisers: Sponsors and advertisers play a significant role in funding the renovation projects showcased on \\"Holmes Next Generation.\\" The show features numerous sponsored products and services during episodes, ranging from building materials to appliances and furniture. These sponsors and advertisers provide financial support, discounted or donated products and services, or a combination of both in exchange for the exposure and promotion they receive during the show's broadcast. 4. Homeowners: While the show primarily covers renovation costs, homeowners may contribute to the funding in certain cases. For example, if the homeowners want specific upgrades or materials not covered by the show's budget, they might contribute financially to ensure these preferences are met. However, it is worth noting that the primary goal of the show is to provide deserving families with essential renovations, so the homeowners' contribution is usually minimal. 5. Grants and Community Contributions: The show may also receive grants or financial support from local, regional, or national organizations that share the goal of improving living conditions for the show's participants. Additionally, members of the local community may donate their time, materials, or money to help with renovations, especially when the show is working on projects that benefit the broader community, like schools or community centers. In summary, the renovations on \\"Holmes Next Generation\\" are paid for through a combination of sources that include the production company, networks, sponsors, advertisers, homeowners, and sometimes grants and community contributions.

How to give up smoking and not gain weight The 22-year-old X Factor star says she has tried to kick the habit but the fags keep getting the better of her. Weight gain is fairly common among ex-smokers and is a major reason why some women don't give up. Here, nutritionist AMANDA URSELL and fitness expert NICKI WATERMAN tell you how to avoid piling on the pounds after you've stubbed out that final ciggie. AMANDA SAYS: \\"Giving up smoking can lead to the pounds, if not stones, piling on. \\"This is partly because nicotine seems to bump up the metabolism by about seven per cent. It appears to have a pretty instant effect that lasts for about 30 minutes per cigarette. \\"The stronger the nicotine content, the greater this metabolism-boosting effect. \\"Smoking also seems to help to suppress the appetite. It does this in part by helping to block the action of chemicals in the brain that stimulate hunger. Health risk ... TV presenter Stacey Solomon was caught smoking while pregnant \\"But it is important to put things into perspective and to appreciate that, although some people do put on a lot of weight after quitting cigarettes, the average gain is between three and ten pounds. \\"The good news is that some experts report that using nicotine patches helps to lower appetite, and that those who use them while trying to quit gain less weight than those who do not. Having regular 'doses' of carbohydrate may also help to beat the hunger pangs which may be triggered by quitting. \\"And on the day you decide to give up, make sure you have breakfast and keep up this habit. \\"Not having anything to eat first thing can be a real problem because, by mid-morning, your body will not only be craving its usual nicotine fix but will also have low blood sugar. Cravings ... nicotine patches can help lower appetite \\"It is important when giving up smoking to remember that, even though cigarettes appear to help a bit in the battle of the bulge, there are plenty of slim people who do not smoke and plenty of overweight people who do smoke. \\"Continuing to smoke because you think giving up will make you fat is no excuse not to try quitting. \\"Doing so could well save your life.\\" 1. Don't give up when you are tired. Being tired always makes you more hungry. 2. Throw out fattening foods that might tempt you. If you can't do this, put them in a cupboard away from day-to-day foods so you are not constantly seeing them. 3. Stock up on healthy snacks such as satsumas, grapes, low-fat yogurts, small 30g servings of nuts like almonds, cashews and peanuts and some miniature dark-chocolate Green & Black's bars that you can nibble on when the nicotine withdrawal triggers hunger pangs. Fruit during the gloom ... have a healthy snack when nicotine withdrawal sets in 4. Drink at least six to eight cups or mugs of fluids each day to help keep hydrated. Being dehydrated can make you stressed and grumpy. It is not a good idea to try to quit caffeine-containing drinks at the same time as giving up cigarettes. 5. Eat breakfast, lunch and dinner and have a small snack in between to ensure that levels of sugar in your blood are steady and stable. Cracking breakfast ... eggs on toast are a nutritious option Eggs on toast, cereal or fruit salad and yogurt make good breakfasts. Tuna, chicken or hummus-stuffed pitta or wraps are examples of energy-extending lunches and spaghetti Bolognese, baked potato with baked-bean toppings, stir fries and omelettes make good dinners. NICKI SAYS: \\"A new study has discovered that vigorous exercise can have a positive impact on the success rate of women trying to give up smoking. \\"This is exciting news, especially when combined with previous research that shows exercising for one to two hours a week while quitting also significantly reduces the amount of weight gained. \\"By incorporating exercise into your quitting programme, the feelgood endorphins your body produces also help you to overcome the mood swings that come with quitting.\\" Commit to daily exercise sessions during the first month of quitting. Preferably in the morning to perk your mood up for the day ahead. Sign up to classes, if you can, to keep you on track and schedule in things like swimming and cycling. If you prefer, a fast 30-minute walk, skipping or working out to a DVD at home all count. Exercise can help to relieve stress, making it the ideal antidote to tense moments during the day, which can otherwise leave you reaching for the ciggies. Work out what your cigarette triggers are. If you reach for one when you pick up the phone, walk up and down the stairs instead while chatting. Or if you can, go outside and talk while you walk. Figure skating ... exercise is great for keeping trim If your trigger is when you relax in front of the telly, stop watching and try skipping indoors or, again, go for a walk to distract you. Work out your own problem moments and plan ahead to avoid them by replacing them with something active. Define your goals. If you don't have a specific goal, your training will lack direction. To help support your goals, look for programmes that match your needs. For example, if you're running a race to raise money for charity, most charities provide training programmes. Or, try one of the many fitness apps  Nike Training Club, for instance, is free to download. Keep a training diary. Once you've worked out your training programme, it's important to keep a record of your workouts in a diary. The easiest, quickest way to log details is to develop a code for the type and length of workout you do. It also means you can add up your total number of exercise minutes each week. Aim to increase what you do until you have reached four to six hours a week. Stop boredom creeping in. One of the biggest reasons we fall out of love with fitness is getting stuck in a rut. Why not try inline skating or join a sports team? Aim to do at least two different types of cardiovascular exercise a week, whether it's running, cycling or swimming. This keeps your body challenged and mind engaged. Any activity that focuses your mind will ensure you use your body more effectively so you'll get better results. Ideal activities include martial arts such as t'ai chi, karate, capoeira or yoga and Pilates. Get a big exercise high. There's nothing like a high-intensity workout to give you an exercise high and get you wanting more. Research shows intense bouts of exercise release more feelgood hormones and get you fitter quicker. Do at least one good stretch and relaxation session each week as well. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"To give up smoking without gaining weight, you can follow some advice from experts. Eat regular meals and healthy snacks to keep your hunger under control. Drinking enough water also helps. Try exercising, which can improve your mood and help with quitting smoking. Staying active can also help you avoid situations where you might want to smoke.

Question: Where can a television be stored and hidden? A. apartment B. living room C. bedroom D. kitchen E. cabinet The best answer is Answer:","completion":"While all of the given options (apartment, living room, bedroom, kitchen, and cabinet) can potentially accommodate a television, the best option for storing and hiding a television is E. cabinet. A cabinet provides the most suitable and concealed space for a television. Cabinets can be custom-designed or prefabricated to accommodate televisions of various sizes and styles. By hiding and storing a television within a cabinet, it allows for a clean and organized appearance in your living space, maintaining an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. Cabinets with doors or sliding panels will completely hide the television when it is not in use and can be built-in or freestanding, making them adaptable to any room. Moreover, many cabinets also offer additional storage for related electronic equipment such as media players and gaming consoles, keeping these items tidy and out of sight. In comparison, options A, B, C, and D may not necessarily provide the desired level of concealment or storage: A. Apartment: While it is true that a television can be placed within an apartment, the term \\"apartment\\" itself is too broad and does not specify an area or method to store and hide the television effectively. B. Living room: Although televisions are commonly found in living rooms, simply placing the television in this space does not ensure it will be hidden or stored appropriately. A cabinet within the living room could be the perfect solution for this purpose. C. Bedroom: Similarly to the living room, merely placing a television in the bedroom does not guarantee proper storage or concealment. Utilizing a cabinet or another form of hidden storage compartment in the bedroom would create a more suitable space for the television. D. Kitchen: While some people might install a television in their kitchen for entertainment purposes, it is not the most ideal place to store and hide a television as it is typically a high-traffic area with limited space and exposure to heat, humidity, and possible spills. In conclusion, the best answer for storing and hiding a television is to use a cabinet – either in a living room, bedroom, or any other appropriate area of your home. Cabinets provide the necessary concealment and additional storage for electronic devices, ensuring an organized and visually appealing living space."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Heavily debated for several years, this development showcases the strong emotions felt towards the building and underlines the importance of preserving heritage sites for future generations. As we dive into the history of Preston Bus Station, its architectural significance, and the implications of preserving it, one can only wonder about the outcome of the council's decision. A Brief History of Preston Bus Station Opened in 1969, the Preston Bus Station has been the transportation hub of the city for over half a century. Designed by Keith Ingham and Charles Wilson of the Building Design Partnership (BDP) at the peak of Brutalist architecture, it was revered as the epitome of innovative and modern design. Over the years, it has provided a vital link between local and regional transportation networks, making it a lifeline for travelers and Preston residents alike. The Architectural Significance Preston bus station stands as a testament to the Brutalist architectural movement of the mid-20th century, characterized by its solid, imposing facade, and heavy use of raw concrete. A marvel of its time, it features one of the largest unsupported spans in the UK, at 170m long, and boasts the capacity to host 80 double-decker buses under its majestic but functional sweeping arches. The station's large outdoor car park, carefully integrated into the overall structure, adds an element of convenience for users. With a simple yet aesthetically audacious exterior, the bus station symbolizes progress, confidence, and the bold, forward-thinking spirit of the era in which it was built. To many, the building is an essential part of Preston's history and a prime exemplar of BDP's visionary and inspired design. From Decline to Preservation Efforts As time went on, however, the station suffered due to poor maintenance, which inevitably led to its deterioration. The facility fell into disrepair, and the once-treasured architectural icon started to garner negative attention. Faced with exorbitant refurbishing costs, the council explored the possibility of bulldozing the bus station and constructing a new, more compact facility in its place. Additionally, with the decline of Preston's city center, there was a push to revitalize the area by developing modern structures that could ignite its resurgence. However, this decision was not without its detractors. In 2013, the station was granted Grade II listed status, emphasizing its cultural and architectural value and highlighting the need for preservation. Over the years, several proposals have been put forth to save the bus station from demolition, including redesigning it as a youth center, art gallery, or converting it into a regional transport hub. These proposals have garnered massive support from heritage organizations, architecture enthusiasts, and the local community. Implications of Preservation The council's decision to consider preservation bids for the Preston bus station carries significant implications for heritage conservation and the community. Saving the architectural gem ensures that its history, original vision, and innovation can continue to inspire future generations. It allows the citizens of Preston to retain a piece of their city's identity, while simultaneously benefiting from necessary upgrades and improvements the station desperately needs. Moreover, the preservation efforts have the potential to strike the right balance between safeguarding local history and embracing contemporary development. By repurposing the station for modern use, the council can create an adaptable public space that elevates the city's cultural and artistic status while maintaining a sustainable and environment-friendly approach. Conclusion As the council gears up to consider bids to save the Preston bus station from demolition, it is vital for decision-makers to weigh the pros and cons and take into account the significant historical, architectural, and cultural value that this iconic structure represents. With the right blend of restoration, development, and adaptation, the Preston bus station could once again become a flagbearer of Brutalist architecture, while contributing to the city's resurgence and shining as a beacon of North West England's vibrant heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin.

Here are the options: Available choices: -yes. -it is not possible to tell. -no. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To analyze the possibility of concluding that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, let's first delve into the premise and the hypothesis as separate entities. Premise: The premise suggests that Cassidy suspended his/her critical faculties for some reason. Critical faculties refer to one's ability to critically assess, analyze, and judge situations, arguments, or propositions. The premise doesn't provide any details about the specific cause or reason behind the suspension of critical faculties; rather, it portrays a vague scenario with several possible explanations. Hypothesis: The hypothesis posits that Cassidy suspended her husband's critical faculties. This introduces a new element to the discussion: Cassidy's husband. It seems to suggest that some action or intervention on Cassidy's part led to the suspension of her husband's critical faculties. It's important to note that the hypothesis is framed as a question, implying that the reason behind this action is up for debate. Now, let's move onto analyzing this scenario through the lens of the available choices. Yes: If we were to conclude \\"yes\\" as the answer, this would mean that the premise and hypothesis are directly connected, and we could assume that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. However, this assumption might be baseless, as the premise and hypothesis are referring to two different subjects: Cassidy and Cassidy's husband. The premise only involves Cassidy suspending his/her critical faculties, while the hypothesis distinctly refers to Cassidy suspending her husband's critical faculties. No: The choice of \\"no\\" would indicate that the premise being true doesn't necessarily guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. This appears to be a more plausible response, as the premise and hypothesis do not explicitly relate to one another, since they concern two different subjects. It is not possible to tell: This answer suggests that we cannot determine, based on the information given in the premise and choices, whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. In the context of this situation, this answer seems to be the most accurate as the information available is insufficient for drawing any definitive conclusions. To sum up, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis refer to different subjects, and there is not enough information available to establish a direct link between them or to determine if one can lead to the other.

Possible A: use glass, open mouth, eat first, buy alcohol, coffee mug Why is \\"use glass\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Use glass\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense primarily because it is a common and appropriate vessel for consuming a wide range of beverages in a polite and socially acceptable manner. People often choose glassware to serve and drink various types of beverages, such as water, juice, sodas, and even alcoholic drinks. The transparency and elegance of glass make it an appealing choice in many situations, especially when people want to present or consume beverages with a touch of formality or sophistication. It is important to note that different types of glassware are designed for specific beverages and occasions, so selecting the right type of glass can also impact the perception of politeness. For example, using a wine glass for wine or a beer glass for beer can show one's awareness and adherence to social norms and etiquette, thus appearing polite and respectful. The other options, such as \\"open mouth,\\" \\"eat first,\\" \\"buy alcohol,\\" and \\"coffee mug,\\" are less aligned with human common sense for various reasons. \\"Open mouth\\" and \\"eat first\\" are unrelated to choosing a vessel for drinking. \\"Buy alcohol\\" might not be relevant if the context is about consuming a non-alcoholic beverage, and it doesn't directly suggest a polite vessel for drinking in general. Finally, a \\"coffee mug\\" is specifically designed for drinking hot beverages like coffee or tea, and while it can be considered polite in certain contexts (e.g., a casual setting), it might not be the most suitable choice for serving or consuming other types of beverages in all situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The non-profit organisation received 24m (Â£19m) last weekend after a controversial immigration order was issued on Friday. ACLU is teaming up with Y Combinator - which usually works with start-ups - over how to best utilise the donations. Businesses and actors are among those who've contributed. The donations made online at the weekend were six times the yearly average the organisation receives, with ACLU executive director Anthony Romero saying there had been an \\"unprecedented\\" public reaction to the new administration. The California-based firm is described as an accelerator, or incubator. It helps its clients - usually start-ups - with funding as well as mentorship and networking. It typically deals with young companies looking to grow, but has dealt with mature organisations in the past. Executives from firms including Airbnb, Dropbox and Reddit have graduated through its three-month programme in Silicon Valley. As well as enrolling the ACLU in its winter programme, Y Combinator said it was contributing an undisclosed sum of money and would send some of its staff to the ACLU's New York offices. Y Combinator's founder Sam Altman, an outspoken critic of Mr Trump's, said: \\"We've been talking to them (ACLU) for some time. We were generally planning to get started more slowly, but things are so urgent now.\\" In a series of tweets responding to criticism about getting involved he added: \\"I'm hopeful we can help in limited places where we have relevant expertise and otherwise stay out of their way. \\"Even non-tech companies need some tech eg for accepting donations.\\" One of Y Combinator's partners is billionaire investor and Paypal founder Peter Thiel, who also serves as an adviser to Mr Trump. Mr Trump's executive order bans immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the country for 90 days. The US refugee program has also been suspended for 120 days. The ACLU, which has been around for about a century, was among the first to react to the order. It filed a lawsuit which led a federal judge to halt deportations of people detained in US airports. Along with the Urban Justice Center and the state of New York, it has also launched a lawsuit against the order. US ride-sharing company Lyft is among the big donors, and has pledged 1m over the next four years. Actress Kerry Washington asked fans to help celebrate her birthday by donating to the ACLU while popstar Sia tweeted that she would match donations of up to 100,000. The intense backlash against the new policies has led to increased donations to multiple organisations whose causes run counter to his administration.

Backs McDonald’s and Burger King as major employers providing a service.","completion":"Title: Brandon Lewis Defends Fast Food Giants McDonald's and Burger King, Citing Employment and Consumer Responsibility Introduction As the debate surrounding the role of fast-food chains in town centres continues to brew, Conservative MP Brandon Lewis has made headlines with his recent remarks in favor of the fast-food giants McDonald's and Burger King. Lewis, in an interview, has defended the presence and growth of these well-known brands in town centres, arguing that limiting their growth would be a \\"socialist\\" move. Furthermore, Lewis emphasized the significance of personal responsibility when it comes to eating habits and food choices while highlighting the employment opportunities these fast-food chains provide to communities. Opposing the Idea of Government Dictating the Presence of Fast Food Chains in Town Centres Lewis, a staunch believer in free-market capitalism, branded the idea of dictating which businesses can open in town centres as a \\"socialist\\" mentality. According to Lewis, economic freedom and the autonomy to make choices as a consumer are essential aspects of a thriving and healthy market. Implementing restrictive measures to limit the growth of fast-food chains would not only undermine the principles of a free market but also contribute to the erosion of personal and corporate liberties. Encouraging Personal Responsibility over Collective Measures While acknowledging the concerns related to unhealthy eating habits and their implications on public health, Lewis expressed his confidence in the individual's ability to make informed decisions about their dietary choices. He argued that fostering a culture of personal accountability is more effective in addressing issues related to diet and health than implementing constraints on businesses. Lewis's remarks suggest that communities should concentrate on promoting comprehensive nutritional education and raising awareness about the potential hazards of unhealthy eating habits. By fostering a system that encourages knowledge-driven decisions, people would have the power to drive change that benefits their well-being. Emphasizing the Employment Opportunities Offered by McDonald's and Burger King In the era of increasing unemployment rates, McDonald's and Burger King have persistently been significant employers, particularly for young and unskilled workers. Lewis underlined that these fast-food chains provide valuable job opportunities in the local communities where they operate. Additionally, these companies offer training and support systems that enable employees to learn valuable skills and develop their career paths. The presence of these global food chains in town centres, therefore, serves as a dual-purpose solution: meeting the local demand for employment and bringing a popular service to the community. Moreover, Lewis pointed out that the fast-food industry's growth is not limited to McDonald's and Burger King but also includes smaller businesses and franchises that contribute to local economies and generate more employment opportunities. Conclusion When considering the ongoing debate around fast-food chains in town centres, it is crucial to balance the concerns relating to public health with the economic benefits they provide. Brandon Lewis's recent comments call for a shift in focus from restrictive measures to fostering a culture of personal responsibility and awareness surrounding eating habits. His defence of McDonald's and Burger King as major employers emphasizes the importance of embracing their presence not only as popular foodservice providers but also as pivotal players in local job markets. Moving forward, promoting education and empowering individuals to make better dietary choices could be an ideal way to create a balance between enjoying the services offered by fast-food chains and maintaining a healthy lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Sir Arthur John Evans (8 July 1851 - 11 July 1941) was an English archaeologist and pioneer in the study of Aegean civilization in the Bronze Age. He is most famous for unearthing the palace of Knossos on the Greek island of Crete. Evans continued Heinrich Schliemann's concept of a Mycenaean civilization, but found that he needed to distinguish another civilization, the Minoan, from the structures and artifacts found there and throughout the eastern Mediterranean. Evans was also the first to define Cretan scripts Linear A and Linear B, as well as an earlier pictographic writing. Context: Arthur Evans was born in Nash Mills, England, the first child of John Evans (1823-1908) and Harriet Ann Dickinson (born 1824), his first cousin, the daughter of John's employer, the inventor and founder of Messrs John Dickinson, a paper mill. John Evans came from a family of men who were both educated and intellectually active; they were nevertheless undistinguished by either wealth or aristocratic connection. John's father, Arthur Benoni Evans, Arthur's grandfather, had been headmaster of Market Bosworth Grammar School. John knew Latin and could quote the classical authors. In 1840, instead of going to college, John started work in the mill owned by his maternal uncle, John Dickinson. He married his cousin, Harriet, in 1850, which entitled him, in 1851, to a junior partnership in the family business. Profits from the mill would eventually help fund Arthur's excavations, restorations at Knossos, and resulting publications. For the time being they were an unpretentious and affectionate family. They moved into a brick row house built for the purpose near the mill, which came to be called the \\"red house\\" because it lacked the sooty patina of the other houses. Harriet called her husband \\"Jack.\\" Grandmother Evans called Arthur \\"darling Trot,\\" asserting in a note that, compared to his father, he was \\"a bit of a dunce.\\" In 1856, with Harriet's declining health and Jack's growing reputation and prosperity, they moved into Harriet's childhood home, a mansion with a garden, where the children ran free. John maintained his status as an officer in the company, which eventually became John Dickinson Stationery, but also became distinguished for his pursuits in numismatics, geology and archaeology. His interest in geology came from an assignment by the company to study the diminishing water resources in the area with a view toward protecting the company from lawsuits. The mill consumed large amounts of water, which was also needed for the canals. He became an expert and a legal consultant. However, collecting was endemic to the family; his father and grandfather both had done it. He was more interested in the stone-age artifacts he was discovering while mapping stream beds. As Arthur grew older, he was allowed to assist John in looking for artifacts and later classifying the collection. Ultimately John became a distinguished antiquary, publishing numerous books and articles. In 1859 he conducted a geological survey of the Somme Valley with Joseph Prestwich. His connections and invaluable advice were indispensable to Arthur's career throughout the remainder of his long life. Arthur's mother, Harriet, died in 1858 when Arthur was seven. He had two brothers, Philip Norman (1854) and Lewis (1853), and two sisters, Alice (1858) and Harriet (1857). He would remain on excellent terms with all of them all of his life. He was raised by a stepmother, Fanny (Frances), nee Phelps, with whom he also got along very well. She had no children of her own and also predeceased her husband. John's third wife was a classical scholar, Maria Millington Lathbury. When he was 70 they had a daughter, Joan, who would become an art historian. John died in 1908 at 85, when Arthur was 57. His close support and assistance had been indispensable in excavating and conceptualizing Minoan civilization. Question: What happen to his mother?.

Students in at least 32 states are expected to join the grass-roots campaign. It has been bubbling up since demonstrations last fall in California, where students, faculty and unions protested plans for a 32% tuition increase amid the state's fiscal crisis. \\"Students saw that there was an opportunity to do something in their own states because the budget cuts didn't happen just in California,\\" says Monique Teal of the United States Student Association, which represents student governments. University of California regents increased fees as planned. But Gov.

Most of today's efforts focus on public education, where enrollments are growing most rapidly and tuition has risen fastest. But some private schools, including the University of Chicago and Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Fla., are protesting issues such as campus spending decisions and low pay for campus workers. \\"The biggest thread that ties these protests together is the current financial crisis in higher education,\\" says Angus Johnston, who teaches history at City University of New York and tracks protests on his blog, student activism.net. •The University of Illinois-Chicago and University of Minnesota are calling on high-level campus administrators to take pay cuts — \\"chop from the top,\\" they say — rather than lay off workers and junior faculty. •Michigan students statewide plan to rally at the Capitol in Lansing to demand that state scholarship funding be restored. •University of Connecticut students, who say recent protests helped limit next year's tuition increase to 5.6% despite proposals as high as 7.5%, plan to train students in lobbying the state Legislature. •Students at the University of Maryland-College Park and Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond plan to raise concerns about the effect of budget cuts on quality. \\"We're seeing more classes taught by adjuncts and grad students who aren't getting paid (fairly).

Justin felt anger and annoyance because he could not understand why someone would want to take their own life. His perspective on the matter differed greatly from Dennis, who seemed to empathize with the struggles and despair that might lead someone down such a dark path. Justin's anger and annoyance may have stemmed from a variety of factors. It is possible that Justin had personal experiences with friends or family members who committed suicide, leaving him hurt and angry, as he struggled with the painful aftermath that the act leaves on those left behind. Furthermore, Justin might have grown up in an environment that treated mental health issues with a lack of understanding or compassion, resulting in his difficulty to empathize with those who want to commit suicide. On the other hand, Dennis had a deeper understanding and willingness to sympathize with the emotional turmoil that individuals considering suicide go through. He recognized that, for many, it is not a decision made lightly. Instead, it may be the culmination of years of intense emotional pain, mental illness, or traumatic experiences that have pushed them to the brink of hopelessness. Dennis's empathy could be rooted in his own personal struggles or experiences with mental health issues. Perhaps he had friends or family members who had once grappled with suicidal thoughts, allowing him to learn firsthand about the complexities and challenges behind these feelings. This understanding, combined with his innate capacity for empathy, made it easier for Dennis to put himself in the shoes of those who want to commit suicide and recognize the need for compassion, support, and resources. In conclusion, while Dennis exhibited sympathy and understanding towards those who want to commit suicide, Justin felt anger and annoyance. Their contrasting sentiments highlight the complexity of emotions and perspectives surrounding the delicate issue of suicide. Addressing this difference in viewpoint is crucial in cultivating a compassionate, well-informed society that can help support those struggling with mental health and suicidal thoughts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Russia is working on new nuclear missile systems that other powers do not have in order to protect itself against future security threats, President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday. OPTIONS: --World; --Sports; --Business; --Science/Tech;","completion":"This topic is related to \\"World\\" affairs. The statement made by President Vladimir Putin about Russia working on new nuclear missile systems emphasizes the complex dynamics of global security and the continued importance of nuclear weapons in ensuring national protection. The development of such systems is a strategic move by Russia to stay ahead of other powers, as well as to assess potential security threats posed by other nations and adapt their defense mechanisms accordingly. In recent years, there have been significant advancements in missile technology, prompting countries all over the world to upgrade their systems to maintain an advantage. This is especially true for nuclear-armed nations whose policies revolve around deterrence, where the primary objective is to discourage potential adversaries from using nuclear weapons against them. Putin's announcement highlights Russia's ongoing efforts to strengthen and modernize its armed forces. This can be seen as a response to several factors, including changes in the geopolitical landscape, the rise of new powers, and technological advancements. Such developments have a direct impact on the balance of power, compelling states to reassess and modify their defense capabilities to maintain a strategic edge. Moreover, international arms control agreements, like the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) and the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START Treaty), have significantly shaped the field of nuclear missile systems. The INF Treaty, which banned medium-range missiles, was signed between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987, but the United States withdrew in August 2019, citing Russian violations of the treaty. The New START Treaty, signed between Russia and the US in 2010, is set to expire in 2021, and its future remains uncertain. The dissolution of these treaties and the potential end of nuclear arms control may have severe implications on global security, with the likelihood of renewed arms races and increased tensions between nuclear states. In this context, Putin's statements on new missile systems not only signal Russia's commitment to its national security but also bring to light broader concerns about the stability of the current international order. Additionally, the development of missile defense systems by the US and NATO constitutes another layer of complexity. These systems, designed to intercept and neutralize incoming missiles, have been met with suspicion by Russia, which perceives them as undermining its nuclear deterrent capability. Such perceptions have further fueled Russia's resolve to develop advanced missile systems that can evade and overcome these defense measures. In conclusion, President Vladimir Putin's announcement about Russia working on new nuclear missile systems pertains to the realm of \\"World\\" affairs. This development underscores the challenges of global security in an ever-evolving international landscape, marked by shifting alliances and technological advancements. It also emphasizes the ongoing importance of nuclear deterrence and arms control agreements in maintaining peace and stability worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A suspect has been arrested and charged in an alleged anti-gay bias attack on a couple in Chelsea last month. Alfonso Lanier, 23, was charged Tuesday with aggravated harassment and assault as a hate crime, police said. Police Tuesday were still looking for several more suspects. They released sketches of two of the suspects shortly after the attack. The attack happened early on the morning of Wednesday, Aug. 14, in the area of West 25th Street and Ninth Avenue, shortly after Peter Notman and Michael Felenchak left the Chelsea Bowtie Cinemas. The two were walking down the street when two other men approached them yelling anti-gay slurs and then punched and kicked the victims repeatedly, police said. That’s when three or four more men joined in on the attack, police said. “It was six of them against the two of us,” Notman said. “Typical of the cowards they are.” Felenchak, 27, and Notman, 53, were able to use their cell phones to call police. The suspects fled on 9 Avenue in the direction of West 25 Street after the attack, police said. The two were taken to Beth Israel Hospital and treated for their injuries. “I was hit with brass knuckles down the side of my face,” Notman said. “I had contusions, had to have an MRI and Michael received several stitches in his mouth where they punched us.” Felenchak ended up requiring a total of seven stitches. “I was shocked this happened on the street I call home,” Notman said. “Unbelievable.” The arrests Tuesday also came the same day a man was charged with murder as a hate crime in Queens. Steven Torres, 22, of the Bronx, was charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime and criminal possession of a weapon in connection with the death of 69-year-old Ever Orozco under the elevated 7 train tracks at Elmhurst and Roosevelt avenues. Police said Torres confessed after claiming the victim was blowing kisses and making sexual advances. But authorities said there is no evidence to support those claims, CBS 2 reported. Ever’s wife said her husband had dropped her off for a doctor’s appointment a few minutes before the fatal attack. A rash of anti-gay attacks was plaguing the city only a few months ago. In the severest incident, Mark Carson, 32, was shot and killed on May 18 by a man who first called him and his partner “f***ots” and asked if they were “gay wrestlers,” police said. Couples were attacked in at least two other incidents in May. On May 5, Nick Porto and his partner, Kevin Atkins, were beaten near Madison Square Garden after a group of men wearing Knicks shirts called them anti-gay slurs. Porto was among the speakers at a rally in Greenwich Village denouncing the attacks and calling for an end to the violence. And early on May 10, two men tried to get into an after-hours billiards hall on West 32nd Street but were not let in, police said. They were then approached by a group of approximately five others who proceeded to shout anti-gay slurs and beat the men, police said.

The assault took place August 14 in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. The attackers used derogatory words about the victims' sexual orientations, New York Police Detective Marc Nell said. \\"It makes me sick to my stomach,\\" Michael Felenchak, one of the victims, told CNN affiliate WABC at the time. \\"It scares me. It upsets me. It's really awful.\\" Felenchak, 27, had to have multiple stitches on his chin and suffered scrapes across his stomach from the attack. \\"First they punched me so hard, I feel brass knuckles,\\" the other victim, Peter Nortman, 53, told WABC. \\"Then I fell on the floor, and I jumped back up and I got hit again. And then I tried to pull them down.\\" The attack brought New York community leaders together to raise awareness. New York State Sen. Brad Hoylman and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn handed out flyers to spread the word about what police called a hate crime attack. \\"I am appalled by reports that two men were senselessly beaten in Chelsea simply because they were perceived to be gay,\\" Quinn said.

If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave.

Information: - A nation (from Latin: \\"natio\\", \\"people, tribe, kin, genus, class, flock\\") is a large group or collective of people with common characteristics attributed to them including language, traditions, \\"mores\\" (customs), \\"habitus\\" (habits), and ethnicity. By comparison, a nation is more impersonal, abstract, and overtly political than an ethnic group. It is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity, and particular interests. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - A role (also rôle or social role) is a set of connected behaviours, rights, obligations, beliefs, and norms as conceptualized by people in a social situation. It is an expected or free or continuously changing behaviour and may have a given individual social status or social position. It is vital to both functionalist and interactionist understandings of society. Social role posits the following about social behaviour: - A residential community is a community , usually a small town or city , that is composed mostly of residents , as opposed to commercial businesses and / or industrial facilities , all three of which are considered to be the three main types of occupants of the typical community . Residential communities are typically communities that help support more commercial or industrial communities with consumers and workers ; this phenomenon is probably because some people prefer not to live in an urban or industrial area , but rather a suburban or rural setting . For this reason , they are also called dormitory towns , bedroom communities , or commuter towns . An example of a residential community would include a small town or city located a number of miles outside a larger city , or a large town located near a smaller , yet more commercially or industrially centered , town or city . - In the context of human society, a family (from ) is a group of people affiliated either by consanguinity (by recognized birth), affinity (by marriage or any other relationship like siblings families etc..), or co-residence (as implied by the etymology of the English word \\"family\\") or some combination of these. Members of the immediate family include spouses, parents, brothers, sisters, sons, and/or daughters. Members of the extended family may include grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, and/or siblings-in-law. Sometimes these are also considered members of the immediate family, depending on an individual's specific relationship with them. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - A community is commonly considered a social unit (a group of people) who have something in common, such as norms, values, or identity. Often - but not always - communities share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood). Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), \\"community\\" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities. - The world is the planet Earth and all life upon it, including human civilization. In a philosophical context, the world is the whole of the physical Universe, or an ontological world. In a theological context, the \\"world\\" is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred. The \\"end of the world\\" refers to scenarios of the final end of human history, often in religious contexts. - In geography, statistics and archaeology, a settlement, locality or populated place is a community in which people live. A settlement can range in size from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Settlements may include hamlets, villages, towns and cities. A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by a particular people. What is the relationship between 'residential community' and 'locality'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between a 'residential community' and a 'locality' is that both terms describe a specific type of human settlement in which people live. A residential community is a community composed mostly of residents, with a focus on providing living spaces rather than commercial or industrial facilities. It generally supports other commercial or industrial communities by housing workers or consumers. These communities can be found in suburban or rural settings and can include small towns, cities, or commuter towns. On the other hand, a locality is a broader term that encompasses any type of human settlement, regardless of its size or focus. It can include hamlets, villages, towns, cities, and other populated places, without specifying the primary purpose or nature of the community. The main aspect of a locality is that it is a place where people live. In summary, a residential community is a specific type of locality that focuses on providing living spaces for people, while a locality is a more general term for any type of human settlement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: The restored tomb of which dramatist was unveiled in Paris in November 2011, after being ruined by lipstick smears left by thousands of kisses?","completion":"The restored tomb unveiled in Paris in November 2011 belonged to the renowned Irish playwright, poet, and novelist, Oscar Wilde. Wilde, born on October 16, 1854, was a prominent literary figure in the late Victorian era. He is well-known for his works such as \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" \\"The Importance of Being Earnest,\\" and many other plays, essays, and poems. Oscar Wilde's tomb is located in the famous Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, where many notable figures are also buried, such as Jim Morrison, Edith Piaf, and Frédéric Chopin. Fans of Wilde from all over the world visit his tomb to pay their respects. It had become a tradition for admirers to leave lipstick kisses on the monument, using the tomb as a canvas for love notes, poems, and quotes from his works. However, this seemingly harmless practice was causing damage to the tomb. The acidic properties of the lipstick were eroding the surface of the stone monument, prompting authorities and preservationists to take action. Thanks to a fundraising campaign led by the Irish government and the French Wilde fan base, as well as a generous donation approximately totaling to €40,000 by the Irish actor Rupert Everett (who also starred as Oscar Wilde in the movie \\"The Happy Prince\\" in 2018), the tomb underwent a significant restoration process. Sculpted by Jacob Epstein, the tomb features a unique modernist angel, which had also been vandalized and needed restoration work. The restoration process involved cleaning the stone to remove the lipstick stains and repairing the damaged areas. During the unveiling on November 30, 2011, a new glass barrier was presented to protect the monument from further damage. The barrier discourages visitors from kissing or touching the tomb directly, ensuring that the restored tomb remains preserved for future generations to appreciate and admire. The fact that Oscar Wilde's tomb was and continues to be a site of pilgrimage for literature enthusiasts and admirers worldwide attests to the lasting significance and influence of his work. The restoration of his tomb represents not only the preservation of an invaluable piece of history but also the ongoing celebration of his contributions to literature and the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: the cause of water scarcity in cape town? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let me research and analyze the cause of water scarcity in Cape Town. Step 1: Researching the background of Cape Town's water situation I will look for the geographical, historical, and environmental factors that have contributed to the water scarcity in Cape Town. Step 2: Analyzing the available information I will analyze the data gathered from my research to identify the major contributing factors to the water scarcity in Cape Town. Step 3: Organizing and summarizing the findings I will organize my findings and summarize them in a way that best explains the cause of water scarcity in Cape Town. Based on my research, I found that the main cause of water scarcity in Cape Town can be attributed to the following factors: 1. Prolonged drought: Cape Town experienced a severe drought from 2015 to 2018, which was one of the worst in more than a century. This significantly reduced the available water in reservoirs and strained the city's existing water infrastructure. 2. Climate change: Climate change is causing erratic weather patterns, which affects precipitation. In Cape Town's case, it has contributed to reduced rainfall, decreasing the replenishment of the city's water supply. 3. Population growth: Rapid population growth and urbanization have led to increased demand for water, which has put immense pressure on the city's limited water resources. 4. Aging infrastructure: The city's water infrastructure is aged and needs to be upgraded to address the needs of the growing population and ensure sustainable water management. 5. Inefficient water use: High levels of water consumption, combined with ineffective water management practices, contributed to the water crisis. Cape Town residents had to adapt by implementing significant water-saving measures. A: The cause of water scarcity in Cape Town is primarily due to a combination of factors, including prolonged drought, climate change, rapid population growth, aging infrastructure, and inefficient water use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Living in Hawaii offers a unique experience that typically includes natural beauty, a diverse culture, and a warm climate. Both of the questions you've asked essentially have the same meaning, which is asking about the general experience and lifestyle of living in Hawaii. Now, to provide a detailed answer about what it's like to live in Hawaii, let's dive into various aspects that contribute to the overall experience: 1. Natural Beauty: Hawaii is well-known for its breathtakingly beautiful landscapes, including picturesque beaches, lush rainforests, and magnificent volcanic mountains. People living in Hawaii often have countless opportunities to enjoy outdoor activities like surfing, snorkeling, hiking, paddleboarding, and whale-watching. This closeness to nature contributes to a laid-back and relaxed lifestyle. 2. Climate: Hawaii boasts warm weather and a tropical climate throughout the year, with temperatures averaging around 80°F (27°C). This allows residents to enjoy outdoor activities all year round, which contributes to an active lifestyle and overall sense of wellbeing. However, it is important to note that the islands experience rainy seasons and occasional hurricane threats, requiring residents to remain prepared for potential weather changes. 3. Cultural Diversity: Hawaii is known for its rich cultural blend, largely influenced by Native Hawaiian, Asian, and Pacific Island cultures. Residents of Hawaii often appreciate and respect the various cultural practices and traditions, which can be experienced through local food, language, music, and dance. This diversity fosters a sense of community and social cohesion throughout the islands. 4. Cost of Living: One of the most significant challenges of living in Hawaii is the high cost of living, which is among the highest in the United States. Housing, food, and utilities tend to be more expensive than in many other locations. However, those who are able to manage the financial aspects of living in Hawaii may find the unique experience and quality of life well worth the higher living costs. 5. Traffic and Transportation: Oahu, in particular, is known for its congested traffic, particularly in and around the capital city, Honolulu. Public transportation is available, but it's not as comprehensive as in many larger cities, prompting many residents to rely on personal vehicles. However, the smaller size of the islands enables residents to reach many destinations relatively quickly. 6. Island Life: Living in Hawaii means living on an island or archipelago, which can sometimes feel isolating for those who are used to more extensive land areas. While Hawaii has all the modern amenities, it is still quite a distance from the contiguous United States, which can lead to feelings of remoteness. 7. Work Opportunities: Job opportunities in Hawaii can be somewhat limited and often center around tourism, agriculture, and government services. However, the emergence of remote work options has broadened the availability of jobs for many Hawaii residents. It's important to have a stable job and financial plan when considering a move to Hawaii due to the high cost of living. In summary, living in Hawaii offers a unique, diverse, and outdoor-oriented experience, with a year-round warm climate and stunning natural beauty. However, the challenges include a high cost of living, limited job opportunities, and potential feelings of isolation due to the island's geographic location. Both questions you've asked ultimately seek to understand this general experience, although the second question does so with a more casual tone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The question asks about the types of buildings that typically have columns, and we are provided with five options: Whitehouse, Pantheon, Roman architecture, Spreadsheet, and Greece. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options. Option D, Spreadsheet, can be eliminated because it is not related to any type of building. It is a software tool used for data organization and manipulation. Step 3: Identify relevant building types, architectural styles, or location. Option A, the Whitehouse, is a specific building rather than a type of building or architectural style, and although it has columns, it's not the most accurate answer. Option E, Greece, is a location rather than a type of building or architectural style. However, Greece has historically significant examples of buildings with columns – specifically, the ancient architecture of Greece exhibits a heavy use of columns in numerous iconic landmarks. Step 4: Compare the remaining options. Option B, Pantheon, is also a specific building rather than a type of building or architectural style. The Pantheon is a famous Roman temple (now a church), and it does feature columns but doesn't represent a broad range of buildings with columns. Option C, Roman architecture, is the most fitting answer. It is a style of architecture that commonly used columns in many different types of buildings, including temples, basilicas, and monumental structures. Conclusion: The answer is \\"Roman architecture\\" because Roman architecture is a style that commonly incorporates columns in various types of buildings, while the other options are either irrelevant, too specific, or related more to a location rather than a style of architecture."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo, also known as Zaire, DR Congo, East Congo, DRC, DROC, Congo-Kinshasa or simply the Congo, is a country located in Central Africa. The DRC borders the Central African Republic and South Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania to the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; the Republic of the Congo to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest. It is the second-largest country in Africa (largest in Sub-Saharan Africa) by area and eleventh largest in the world. With a population of over 80 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most populated officially Francophone country, the fourth most-populated nation in Africa and the seventeenth most populated country in the world. The territory of the DR Congo was first settled by humans around 90,000 years ago. Bantu peoples began migrating into the region in the 5th century and again in the 10th century. In the West of the region, the Kingdom of Kongo ruled from the 14th to 19th centuries, while in the centre and East of the region, the kingdoms of Luba and Lunda ruled from the 16th and 17th centuries to the 19th century. In the 1870s, just before the onset of the Scramble for Africa, European exploration of the Congo was carried out, first led by Henry Morton Stanley under the sponsorship of King Leopold II of Belgium. Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the Conference of Berlin in 1885 and made the land his private property, naming it the Congo Free State. During the Free State, the colonial military unit, the \\"Force Publique,\\" forced the local population into producing rubber, and from 1885 to 1908, millions of Congolese died as a consequence of disease and exploitation.

Q:I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora.

Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... Question: What does Kane probably think of Mike Pompeo? Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha likely holds a professional and collaborative view of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Kang noted that she was in close communication with Pompeo regarding the military drills immediately following the Singapore summit. This communication suggests that Kang views Pompeo as a reliable partner in the dialogue process surrounding the military exercises and the North Korean denuclearization issue. While there is no specific information on how Kang feels about Pompeo on a personal level, their interaction and cooperation in addressing international matters suggest that Kang respects Pompeo's position and values their working relationship in addressing these critical issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A large rocky area is formed - The rocky area has a higher elevation than the surrounding areas - Water from precipitation falls in the area - The water forms a stream - The stream flows towards lower elevation - The stream becomes a river - The river continues to flow along the same path for a long time - The river erodes the rocky area that it touches - The eroded area cuts deeply into the rock. Question: suppose more rainy days happens, how will it affect bigger river forms. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The increase in rainy days will have a significant effect on the formation of bigger river forms. The additional precipitation will contribute to the overall volume of water in the river, which, in turn, will increase the erosional power of the river system. This heightened erosion capacity will lead to more rapid and extensive changes in the landscape, particularly in the areas surrounding the river. As the amount of precipitation increases, the water will continue to flow through the stream, which will eventually become a larger and more powerful river. As the river's erosional power and capacity for transporting sediment increase, so too will its ability to erode and reshape the rocky area that it touches. This intensified erosion process will lead to a deeper and wider cut into the rock, which would be considered the second effect mentioned. With the supposed perturbation of more rainy days, the second effect of the river eroding the rocky area that it touches will be considerably enhanced. The increased volume of water will provide more energy for erosion, allowing the river to carve through the rocky landscape more efficiently and rapidly. This means that the effect on the rocky area will be more pronounced, as it will be eroded more swiftly and to a greater extent than it would under average rainfall circumstances. In conclusion, more rainy days will have a substantial effect on the formation of bigger river forms and will result in increased erosion and a deeper cut into the rocky area that the river touches. This perturbation will accelerate the process of river formation and the reshaping of the landscape, leading to a more dramatic second effect in terms of how the river erodes the rocky area."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write highlights for this article: A burglar suffocated when his neck became trapped under a wooden fence panel as he attempted to flee from a house, an inquest has heard. Stephen Pope, 35, died from asphyxiation after he became trapped between the panel and a concrete gravel board at a property in Waltham Abbey in Essex, in March this year. Today, an inquest at Chelmsford Coroners’ Court, ruled that Mr Pope had died accidentally while trying to escape from the garden of the house with stolen items. Stephen Pope, 35, who suffocated when his neck became trapped under a wooden fence panel as he tried to escape from a house. Accomplice Albert Brinkley, 27, of no fixed address, was jailed for 12 months earlier this year after admitting the burglary. Coroner Eleanor McGann told the hearing: 'It did become obvious early on that this death was part of a burglary. 'We know that somebody has confessed to the burglary, has been convicted and has done his time and come out. 'There is evidence Mr Pope was also part of that burglary.' The inquest heard how Mr Pope, also from Waltham Abbey, was found holding a pillow case containing stolen items from the nearby property. A post-mortem revealed that he had been on a cocktail of drugs including cocaine, cannabis and methadone during the break-in. It went onto state Mr Pope had been ‘pinned in a face down and awkward position that could have caused asphyxiation’. An inquest heard that Mr Pope died from asphyxiation after he became trapped between the panel and a concrete gravel board at the property in Waltham Abbey, Essex. Floral tributes were also left at the scene with his family saying at the time that he suffered from 'inner demons' The inquest heard how Mr Pope had told one elderly passer-by, who believed he was a workman, that he was 'okay' when asked if he needed help whilst trapped under the fence panel. He was later discovered unresponsive by another lady who called 999. Two female nurses from a nearby nursing home helped lift the fence panel off Mr Pope before paramedics arrived. But attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and he was declared dead. Mrs McGann added: 'It is perfectly plausible Mr Pope said he was okay as he did not want to be caught with a pillowcase of stolen items.' The coroner ruled the cause of death was compression of the neck in association with postural asphyxia. A secondary factor in the death was noted as mixed drug intoxication. The coroner ruled Mr Pope's death an accident saying the cause of death was compression of the neck. Investigating officer, DS Darren Ward, told the court the death was treated as ‘not suspicious’ following a full investigation. He added: 'The investigation did not reveal a third party was involved in Mr Pope’s death. 'No criminal charges were brought in respect of the death.' Mr Pope had been on bail for theft of fuel when he was found dead outside the property. His parents Barry Pope, 67, a retired bus driver, and Jean Pope, 70, a retired packer, described their son as ‘a lovable rogue’ outside of the inquest whilst slamming the ‘accidental death’ verdict. Mother-of-five, Jean, said: 'We strongly believe that this wasn't an accident. 'Stephen had fractured his back in a car accident the year before. 'How would he be able to lift a fence panel with his injuries? 'We’re not excusing what he did but we just want some closure. 'My son was a lovable rogue who wouldn't hurt a soul. 'I knew he had previous for a bit of shoplifting but I’d never known him to break into a house.' At the time of his death, Mr Pope’s family released a tribute describing him as a ‘troubled and tormented soul’ who was ‘fighting many inner demons’. The statement said: 'He had the ability to make you laugh and lift your heart, but unfortunately also the ability to break it into a thousand pieces. 'He was a troubled and tormented soul, with some mental health issues and was fighting many inner demons for most of his life. 'This is a devastating tragedy for our family, one from which we will never recover. 'A hole has been ripped in our hearts and that void will never be filled.” A 51-year-old who also arrested in connection with the incident was released from bail with no further action.

Write an article based on this \\"The UK would still be able to trade freely within Europe even if it left the EU, Michael Gove has said.\\"","completion":"Title: \\"Post-Brexit Trade Freedom in Europe, Asserts Michael Gove\\" Introduction Amidst the uncertainty that surrounds Britain's decision to depart from the European Union, prominent figure, Michael Gove, confidently asserts that the UK will maintain its trade freedom within Europe even post-Brexit. Step 1: Lay the Context, Explaining the Brexit Decision In 2016, the UK took a decisive step that would dramatically change its political and economic landscape; voters opted to leave the EU. Although this decision sparked many concerns regarding its implications on the UK's ability to trade freely in Europe, Michael Gove, a pivotal player in the Leave campaign, expresses optimism. This first section is essential to provide readers with context about the UK's decision of Brexit and its potential impacts on trade in Europe. Mentioning Michael Gove's role helps establish his authority on the subject. Step 2: Discuss Michael Gove’s Stance Gove has unequivocally expressed that exiting the European Union will not hinder the UK’s capacity to trade freely with Europe. He postulates that Brexit could inspire new trade agreements that are even more beneficial than the current system in place within the EU's single market. This confident assertion offers hope amidst fear of potential economic repercussions post-Brexit. Discussing Gove's point of view is crucial to highlight his anticipations about post-Brexit trade relations. This also clarifies the main argument of this article. Step 3: Analyzing His Assertions Analyzing Gove's statement requires a look at the UK's trade relationship within the EU. Currently, being a part of the EU allows the UK access to the single market, eliminating tariffs, quotas, and paperwork, thus enabling free trade. Leaving the EU could potentially harm this set-up, but Gove believes in the establishment of trade pacts that could maintain, if not enhance, the free trade status. Introducing facts about current trade practices gives a reference point to evaluate Gove's assertions' validity. It also enables readers to understand the stakes involved in this situation. Step 4: Potential Challenges and Counterarguments While Gove's optimism provides a positive outlook, critics caution that leaving the EU might complicate trade relationships, and new agreements may take considerable time and negotiation effort. Naysayers argue that Brexit could result in a loss of the \\"passports\\" UK financial firms use to do business across EU, potentially harming one of the UK's biggest industries. Presenting counterarguments provides a balanced view of the situation, helping readers understand the broader context. It’s vital for credibility and thorough analysis of the circumstance at hand. Conclusion Despite conflicting views, the assurance from Michael Gove brings hope to the potential trade opportunities that can emerge for the UK, post-Brexit. As the UK braces for a new era outside the European Union, only time will tell whether Gove's confidence will translate into the success of free trade within Europe, as envisioned. The conclusion sums up the debate surrounding the UK's trade potential post-Brexit and Gove's stance on the issue. It signals the end of the article and leaves the readers with a crucial point to consider."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

John initiates and controls the various experimental sexual practices of this volatile relationship to push Elizabeth's boundaries. In doing so, Elizabeth experiences a gradual downward spiral toward emotional breakdown. Elizabeth first sees John in New York City where she grocery shops and again at a street market where she decides against buying an expensive scarf. John wins her heart when he eventually produces that scarf. They start dating, and Elizabeth is increasingly subjected to John's behavioral peculiarities; he blindfolds Elizabeth, who is at first reluctant to comply with his sexual fantasy demands. Yet she sees him as loving and playful. He gives her an expensive gold watch, and instructs her to use it to think about him at noon. She takes this imperative even further by masturbating at her workplace at the designated time. However, he ultimately confuses Elizabeth by his reluctance to meet her friends despite the intimacy of their sexual relations. Elizabeth's confusion about John increases when he leaves her alone at his apartment. She examines his closet until she discovers a photograph of him with another woman.

Scopwick can be considered a sparsely populated village based on the information provided in the paragraph. With a population of 815 recorded in the 2011 census, it is a relatively small community. The civil parish encompasses both Scopwick and Kirkby Green, a nearby hamlet, meaning that the population density in the area is relatively low. The fact that Scopwick and Kirkby Green are characterized as a village and hamlet, respectively, further supports the notion of sparsity. Villages are typically smaller and less densely populated than towns and cities. Likewise, hamlets are generally even smaller than villages, often consisting of just a few houses or buildings. The paragraph also provides some information about the geography, mentioning that there is a narrow stream running alongside the village's main road. This suggests that the village's layout may be stretched out along the water, which could add to the perception of sparseness when considering the population's distribution across the area.

Information: - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others. - In astronomy and physical cosmology, the metallicity or Z is the fraction of mass of a star or other kind of astronomical object that is not in hydrogen (X) or helium (Y). Most of the physical matter in the universe is in the form of hydrogen and helium, so astronomers use the word \\"metals\\" as a convenient short term for \\"all elements except hydrogen and helium\\". This usage is distinct from the usual physical definition of a solid metal. The rationale for the astronomical usage is that in the high-temperature and pressure environment of a star, atoms do not undergo chemical reactions and effectively have no chemical properties, including that of being a metal as usually understood. For example, stars and nebulae with relatively high abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon are called \\"metal-rich\\" in astrophysical terms, even though those elements are non-metals in chemistry. - AB Doradus Moving Group is a group of about 30 associated stars that are moving through space together with the star AB Doradus . A moving group is distinguished by its members having about the same age , composition ( or metallicity ) and motion through space . Hence they most likely formed in the same location . This group is located about 20 parsecs from the Earth and is the closest known co-moving group . The average space velocity of this group has components of U = 8 , V = 27 and W = 14 km / s. About 10 of these stars form a nuclear group within a volume roughly 10 parsecs across . The proximity of this moving group makes it useful for studies of shared stellar properties , as well as detection of companions through direct imaging . These can be used for refinement of young stellar models , for example . - AB Doradus is a pre-main-sequence quadruple star system in the constellation Dorado. The primary is a flare star that shows periodic increases in activity. - Dorado (English pronunciation: ) is a constellation in the southern sky.

It simply describes a person's appearance and posture (\\"A man in a black shirt and khaki pants holding his arms straight in the air.\\"). On the other hand, the second sentence provides a context to the man's actions and an underlying emotion (\\"A man throws up his arms in frustration after hearing some bad news\\"). Here, the man's action of throwing up his arms is specifically linked to the emotion of frustration, and the cause of that emotion is the bad news he has received. Since there is no emotional context or event described in the first sentence, it is not possible to conclusively determine that the second sentence is a true interpretation of the man's actions in the first sentence. Moreover, the first sentence mentions the man holding his arms straight in the air, while the second sentence says that he throws up his arms. The former could imply a controlled and sustained action, whereas the latter suggests a faster, more forceful movement. The difference in the description of the arm movement also prevents us from concluding that the second sentence is a true representation of the first.

The dismembered torso, feared to be that of Gemma McCluskie, 29, was discovered floating a short distance from her home. Sources said the body was naked and the arms, legs and head had been cut off with a sharp tool. Frantic: The brothers of the ex-Eastenders' actress have been searching for her since she disappeared from her home in Bethnal Green, East London Miss McCluskie’s brother Tony, 35, was arrested yesterday when officers raided the East London home they shared. Hours earlier he had joined family members in an increasingly frantic search for his sister, who had been missing since last Thursday. He told friends her disappearance was ‘completely’ out of character and she had never been missing before. ‘We are going out of our mind with worry,’ he said. ‘She is a bubbly, outgoing, strong and independent woman.’ TV past: Mcluskie with Dean Gaffney in Eastenders. She appeared in more than 30 episodes of the BBC soap Miss McCluskie appeared in more than 30 episodes of the BBC soap opera as teenage temptress Kerry Skinner in 2001. The part was her only high-profile acting role and it is thought more recently she may have been acting as a carer for her elderly mother, who lived with her and her brother. Their £280,000 maisonette in Bethnal Green was last night sealed off and was being searched by forensics officers.

Step 1: Identify the information in the given statement The given statement provides following information: 1. Two women are present. 2. They are having coffee. 3. They are outside. Step 2: Identify the information in the conclusion The conclusion statement consists of the following information: 1. Two women are present, and they are blond. 2. They are sitting outside. 3. People are walking by, wearing casual clothing and some wearing bookbags. Step 3: Compare the information We will now compare the information provided in the given statement with the conclusion statement to see if it is logically possible to conclude one from the other. 1. The given statement mentions two women are present, but it doesn't mention their hair color (blond) as in the conclusion statement. Hence, there is incomplete information. 2. The given statement mentions they are outside but does not specify they are sitting. However, having coffee outside suggests they are likely sitting. Thus, this part is reasonable to assume. 3.

Erin was injured during the event but not Laura because","completion":"Laura was right in the middle of the safe area. Erin was injured during the event but not Laura because Laura was right in the middle of the safe area. Prior to the event, the organizers had planned and designated a specific safe zone for the participants, ensuring that those who remained within this area would be protected from any potential hazards or accidents. This safe space functioned as a haven, as well as a strategic spot, providing the necessary shelter from harm for anyone who chose to reside in it. Laura was deeply aware of the importance of her personal safety during the event. Due to her cautious nature, she thoroughly researched the layout of the area beforehand and took all event precautions seriously, leading to her decision to stay within the secure zone. Consequently, her vigilant approach to personal safety aided in her remaining unharmed throughout the course of the event. On the contrary, Erin had omitted the proper precautions when attending the event. Failing to look into the event guidelines and recommendations, Erin was unfortunately unaware of the safe area's existence. While exploring and enjoying the event, Erin ventured outside of the safety boundaries. As a result, she was eventually caught in an unexpected accident, resulting in her injury. Had Erin taken the time to understand the event's safety measures and remained in the designated safe area like Laura, she could have likely avoided her injury. As this incident demonstrates, it is of great importance to prioritize one's safety and to be proactive in adhering to any guidelines or precautions set forth by event organizers. Furthermore, it serves as a lesson for everyone to pay attention to any potential risks during such events and take the necessary steps to ensure their well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Yes, both questions are essentially asking the same thing - how to reduce the size of the tummy or belly area. To reduce a chubby tummy, you can follow these steps: 1. Assess your current diet: Track your daily food intake and identify any unhealthy, high-calorie, or high-sugar foods that you can replace with healthier alternatives. 2. Create a balanced diet: Incorporate whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. Reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates and added sugars. 3. Control portion sizes: Eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day can help control your hunger and prevent overeating. 4. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water will aid digestion and keep you feeling full, making it easier to control your calorie intake. As a general guideline, aim for at least 8 cups of water per day. 5. Incorporate regular exercise: Engage in a combination of both cardiovascular exercise and strength training. Cardiovascular exercises like walking, jogging, swimming, or biking will help burn calories, while strength training exercises (focusing on your core muscles) will help tone your abdominal muscles. 6. Prioritize sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Poor sleep can cause hormonal imbalances and lead to weight gain. 7. Manage stress: High stress levels can contribute to weight gain, especially in the abdominal area. Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to help manage stress levels. 8. Be patient and consistent: Reducing belly fat takes time and commitment. Don't expect immediate results, and stay consistent in your diet and exercise habits. Remember that targeted fat loss (spot reduction) is a myth, and fat loss will happen throughout the body. By following these steps, you should see an overall reduction in body fat, including your tummy area."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is best remembered as their lead guitarist, as the youngest brother of bandmates Brian and Dennis Wilson, and as the group's de facto leader in the early 1970s. He was also the band's musical director on stage from 1965 until his death. Influenced by the guitar playing of Chuck Berry and the Ventures, Carl's initial role in the group was that of lead guitarist and backing vocals, but he performed lead vocals on several of their later hits, including \\"God Only Knows\\" (1966), \\"Good Vibrations\\" (1966), and \\"Kokomo\\" (1988). By the early 1980s the Beach Boys were in disarray; the band had split into several camps. Frustrated with the band's sluggishness to record new material and reluctance to rehearse, Wilson took a leave of absence in 1981. He quickly recorded and released a solo album, Carl Wilson, composed largely of rock n' roll songs co-written with Myrna Smith-Schilling, a former backing vocalist for Elvis Presley and Aretha Franklin, and wife of Wilson's then-manager Jerry Schilling. The album briefly charted, and its second single, \\"Heaven\\", reached the top 20 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. Wilson also undertook a solo tour to promote the album, becoming the first member of the Beach Boys to break ranks. Initially, Wilson and his band played clubs like The Bottom Line in New York City and the Roxy in Los Angeles. Thereafter, he joined the Doobie Brothers as opening act for their 1981 summer tour. Wilson recorded a second solo album, Youngblood, in a similar vein, but by the time of its release in 1983 he had rejoined the Beach Boys. Although Youngblood did not chart, a single, the John Hall-penned \\"What You Do To Me\\", peaked at number 72, making Wilson the second Beach Boy to land a solo single on the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, the song cracked the top 20 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. Wilson frequently performed that song and \\"Rockin' All Over the World\\" (from the same album), as well as \\"Heaven\\" from the 1981 album, at Beach Boys' concerts in the 1980s. \\"Heaven\\" was always announced as a tribute to brother Dennis, who drowned in December 1983. Did this get good reviews?","completion":"Carl Dean Wilson was a very talented musician who helped create a famous band called the Beach Boys with his brothers Brian and Dennis.

Come up with unit tests as you write code, if you need to. Write testable code. Article:","completion":"Title: Embracing Test-Driven Development: The Power of Writing Tests Before Writing Code Introduction Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach that prioritizes writing tests before writing the actual code. The technique emphasizes the importance of writing unit tests as you write code, allowing you to ensure that each piece of your code functions as expected. By writing tests first, you effectively set clear expectations for your code's behavior and design, resulting in more reliable and maintainable software. This article discusses the benefits of writing the test before the code, the key principles of test-driven development, and how to go about writing testable code. 1. Writing the Test Before the Code The TDD process begins with writing a test. Instead of writing code and then writing tests to verify that code, this approach embodies the concept of \\"test-first.\\" You start by defining what success should look like for a specific piece of functionality, making it clear where to focus when writing the code to follow. In other words, the test acts as the desired outcome, which the code will now have to meet. This approach results in better-designed software, as it ensures that the code serves a specific purpose. The benefits of writing the test first are numerous. It improves clarity, reduces the chances of overlooking potential errors or edge cases and promotes a higher level of discipline throughout the development process. It also aids in narrowing down the area to focus on when encountering issues, as you'll know which specific test and requirement your code is failing. 2. Writing Unit Tests as You Write Code Unit tests allow developers to verify the functionality of individual components of their software system by isolating them from the rest of the application. Writing unit tests as you write code empowers you to catch bugs early and maintain high levels of code quality, as you continuously validate the functionality of your codebase. TDD suggests that you should practice on-going test writing and code maintenance processes, allowing for constant refinement and improvement. Writing tests while building out your code ensures that your codebase is thoroughly assessed from beginning to end, mitigating the risk of unexpected bugs and inconsistencies down the line. 3. The Importance of Writing Testable Code Testable code is designed to be easily tested, allowing you to verify its functionality quickly and efficiently. By emphasizing testable code, developers are able to create software that is not only easier to understand and maintain but also more resilient and adaptive to change. To write testable code, consider the following tips: a. Break down your code into small, manageable components: Decomposing your code into independent units enables you to isolate each component during testing, making it easier to understand, maintain, and troubleshoot. b. Follow the \\"Single Responsibility Principle\\": Each function and class should have a single, well-defined purpose. This simplifies the testing process, as each component's responsibility is easily discernable and separate from others. c. Use interfaces and dependency injection: Interfaces allow you to define the way that different components interact with each other and enable you to replace dependencies during testing with alternative implementations (e.g., mock objects). d. Minimize global state: Limit the reliance on global variables, as they can lead to issues with testing isolation and increase the potential for conflicts and side effects. Conclusion The practice of writing tests before code, designing unit tests as you write code, and focusing on testable code are integral principles in the test-driven development approach. Embracing this strategy ensures higher code quality, increased maintainability, and fewer bugs - all of which lead to a more efficient and reliable software development process. By adopting the test-first mindset, developers can create robust applications and continuously deliver excellent results, setting the stage for long-term success across software projects."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kevin Maurice Garnett (born May 19, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 21 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played the power forward and center positions. In high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and won a national player of the year award. He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. On June 28, 2013, the day of the NBA draft, the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets reached a deal to trade Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry for future first-round picks in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 drafts, as well as Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Kris Joseph, MarShon Brooks and Keith Bogans. The deal was finally completed on July 12, with Brooklyn also receiving D. J. White. Garnett chose to wear number 2 to honor his former Minnesota Timberwolves teammate Malik Sealy. On December 13, 2013, Garnett surpassed 14,000 career rebounds, becoming only the tenth player in NBA history to do so. In reaching the milestone, Garnett also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone as the only players to reach 25,000 points, 14,000 rebounds and 5,000 assists. He reached the milestone in the third quarter of a 103-99 road loss to the Detroit Pistons. The Nets cherished Garnett's leadership and passion. Despite boasting a starting line-up of Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Paul Pierce, and Garnett, the Nets were unable to advance past the second round of the playoffs, while Garnett finished his 19th NBA season with career low averages of 6.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. On November 1, 2014, Garnett had arguably his best game for the Nets as he recorded 18 points and 14 rebounds in 35 minutes of action in the Nets' 102-90 win over the Detroit Pistons. Six days later, he recorded five rebounds in a 110-99 win over the New York Knicks and by doing so, passed Walt Bellamy for ninth place on the all-time rebounding list.

[b]. yes....I think the answer is","completion":"[a]. no. The answer provided does not accurately address the key questions that the Director of Intelligence had about the CIA's operation of the Predator. A more detailed and appropriate answer would be: The Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, had several key questions and concerns regarding the CIA's operation of the armed Predator drone. These questions were related to financial aspects, chain of command, authority, and technical capabilities of the system. 1. Financial aspects: There was a disagreement between the CIA and the Department of Defense about who would bear the cost of the Predators, as each drone cost around 3 million. The CIA wanted the Air Force to cover the expense of lost drones, but Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz argued that the CIA should pay for them. 2. Chain of command and authority: Tenet questioned whether he, as the Director of Central Intelligence, should operate an armed Predator, since it would involve going outside of normal military command and control. He raised concerns about deciding the chain of command and identifying the person responsible for initiating a strike. Moreover, he emphasized that neither he nor the CIA had the authority to carry out such operations. 3. Technical capabilities: The Hellfire missile carried by the Predator required modifications to be effective in different situations. Initially designed for hitting tanks, the warhead needed to be adapted to target individuals and moving vehicles with precision, which was a challenge still being addressed in mid-2001. In conclusion, the key questions and concerns Tenet had about the CIA's operation of the Predator revolved around funding responsibility, chain of command, decision-making authority, and the drone's technical capabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (October 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The disgraced former executioner, or Kogi Kaishakunin to the shogun, Ogami IttÅ is now living rough on the land with his three-year-old son Daigoro, travelling the countryside as a hired killer. Pushing his son in a baby cart, he stops at a bathhouse looking for a room and a bath, and is eagerly welcomed in by a young woman. However, the manager of the house sees IttÅ as a dirty vagabond and scolds the young woman for letting him in the house. Overhearing this, IttÅ goes to the baby cart and retrieves a bundle and hands it to the manager for safe keeping â it is 500 gold pieces, earned from a recent job. The manager's tone quickly changes, but when he tries to wash Daigoro's feet, the boy kicks water at the old man and tromps across the floor, leaving wet footprints. IttÅ's activities are being watched by the Kurokawa spy clan of shinobi-class ninja, which have fallen in with IttÅ's nemesis, the Shadow YagyÅ«. They report on his activities to Sayaka, head of Akari YagyÅ« clan of female assassins. But the Kurokawa are unsure that the women are up to the task of killing IttÅ. Sayaka laughs confidently and tells the Kurokawas' leader to send their best man into the room. She then orders the man to try to exit the room. He tries to do so by grappling onto the ceiling, but the female assassins set upon him and make short work of him, hacking off his ears, fingers, arms and legs, leaving the man a writhing heap of just a torso and head before he is finally finished off. IttÅ, meanwhile, is hired by a clan that specializes in making indigo dye and has a secret process. One of the clan plans to sell out the secret to the shogun. IttÅ must kill him.

Could PIE have developed initially in Anatolia, subsequently acquired by the Yamanaya, and spread by them with the wheel and the horse? Could a family member transfer real estate encumbered by debt to me, and subsequently purchase and forgive that debt from the lender? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"These two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question pertains to linguistics and the spread of ancient cultures, while the second question concerns property law and financial transactions. To explore each question in greater detail: 1. Could Proto-Indo-European (PIE) have initially developed in Anatolia, subsequently acquired by the Yamnaya, and spread by them with the wheel and the horse? Proto-Indo-European (PIE) is the prehistoric ancestor of the Indo-European languages, which include many modern languages such as English, German, Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. The question refers to the possibility of PIE forming in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and being later acquired by the Yamnaya culture, which inhabited the Pontic-Caspian steppe. The Yamnaya people are thought to have played a critical role in spreading the Indo-European languages and associated customs across Europe and Asia. One popular hypothesis, the \\"Anatolian hypothesis,\\" proposed by archaeologist Colin Renfrew, posits that PIE originated in Anatolia around 7,000-5,500 BCE. Renfrew suggests that PIE was spread by the advancement of agriculture, as people moved into new territories and brought their language and farming techniques with them. Another hypothesis, the \\"Kurgan hypothesis,\\" advanced by Marija Gimbutas and refined by other scholars, argues that the PIE homeland was in the Pontic-Caspian steppe and linked mostly with the Yamnaya culture, which existed from 3300 to 2600 BCE. This hypothesis emphasizes the role of the wheel and domesticated horses in facilitating the fast and widespread dispersal of PIE. The Kurgan hypothesis is currently more widely accepted among researchers for various reasons, such as the presence of loanwords in early Indo-European languages related to horse-riding and wheeled vehicles. While the theory of PIE initially developing in Anatolia, then being acquired by the Yamnaya, and later spread with the wheel and the horse is an interesting one, it does not necessarily correspond to the prevailing views in current linguistic and archaeological research. It is also essential to consider the complex processes and interactions between cultures and populations over thousands of years that led to linguistic evolution and the spread of languages. 2. Could a family member transfer real estate encumbered by debt to me, and subsequently purchase and forgive that debt from the lender? The process of transferring real estate encumbered by debt is complex and can involve several steps. The answer provided here is only a general overview, and actual practices can depend on specific property laws in your jurisdiction and the nature of the debt (e.g., mortgage, tax lien, etc.). First, let's clarify what it means for a property to be encumbered by debt. When real estate is used as collateral for a loan, such as in the case of mortgage loans, the property is deemed \\"encumbered.\\" To transfer encumbered property, the transferor must either: a) Pay off the debt, satisfying the lien and releasing the property from the encumbrance, or b) Obtain consent from the lender to transfer the debt along with the real estate. In the situation you describe, a family member could transfer the real estate encumbered by debt to you by adhering to the processes outlined above. However, bear in mind that transferring the property with the debt would require your acceptance of the responsibility of the debt. Furthermore, the terms of the loan may prohibit the lender from allowing a transfer of the debt, and it may require the debt to be paid off, or a new loan to be created for the transferee (i.e., you) instead. Regarding the part about your family member purchasing and then forgiving the debt from the lender, the family member could potentially do so if they acquired some or all of the lender's interest in the debt or the underlying mortgage note. It is essential to consult with legal and financial professionals in your region to determine if this is feasible based on your specific situation and local regulations. In summary, these two questions inquire about entirely different information. The first question focuses on linguistic origins and the spread of ancient cultures, while the second question pertains to law and financial transactions related to property transfers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mentioning that the streets continue to Sixth Avenue somewhat indicates their path after being resumed at Avenue A, but it does not answer the specific question of where the streets end. To obtain a comprehensive answer to the question, additional information could be helpful. For instance, mentioning the street that intersects 8th and 9th Streets after Sixth Avenue could provide a clearer understanding of where the streets end. Additionally, more details on any possible interruptions in their path after Sixth Avenue could help clarify the picture.

Write an article using the following points: 10 people, including grandpa, son and grandson, convicted on serious drug charges. 83-year-old former moonshiner gets 20 years; son who led operation gets 9 years. Attorney: \\"If the father got a longer sentence, it's because he's a lousy father\\" Authorities say case is a microcosm of what's happening across rural America. Article:","completion":"Title: Multigenerational Drug Ring Convictions Shed Light on Rural America's Growing Epidemic Introduction: In a case that is seen as a microcosm of the increasing drug epidemic plaguing rural America, 10 individuals, including three generations of a single family, were found guilty on serious drug charges. This conviction highlights the alarming trend of intergenerational involvement in illicit drug activities in the nation's less populated areas. Body: The patriarch of the drug ring, an 83-year-old former moonshiner, received a 20-year sentence for his role in the illegal operation. His son, who was found to be the leader of the criminal enterprise, was sentenced to nine years in prison. Meanwhile, the grandson also faces significant time behind bars for his involvement. The authorities argue that this case demonstrates the growing issue of drug-related criminal activities in rural areas. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in drug abuse and manufacturing across the country, particularly in rural regions where economic opportunities are scarce and drug use has become a way to cope with financial hardships. In response to the lengthy sentence handed down to the elderly patriarch, the defense attorney stated, \\"If the father got a longer sentence, it's because he's a lousy father.\\" This comment underscores the assertion that the lack of proper guidance and support for younger generations contributed to the criminal conduct observed in this case. The involvement of three generations from the same family in the drug ring is a clear indication of the cyclical nature of crime and addiction in many rural communities. While the crime in this case focused on serious drug charges, it is crucial to examine the larger implications for rural America. Increasing rates of drug-related crimes are indicative of the systemic issues present in these communities. Limited access to quality education, healthcare, and employment opportunities are all factors that contribute to an environment where drugs can thrive. Furthermore, the lack of adequate law enforcement resources in rural areas exacerbates the issue, as criminals are often able to evade capture and continue their illicit activities with little consequence. Conclusion: The conviction of ten individuals, spanning three generations, on serious drug charges serves as a sobering reminder of the drug epidemic affecting rural America. This case illustrates the urgent need for increased resources and targeted intervention strategies to break the cycle of crime and addiction present in these communities. It is essential that society addresses the root causes of this escalating problem to ensure the health, safety, and future of all citizens, regardless of their geographical location."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The water will melt: Water is already in liquid form, so it can't melt. This option is incorrect. B. The water will evaporate: Warming the water, even with low heat, will lead to increased molecular activity, and over time, this will cause some level of water evaporation. This option seems plausible. C. The water will form a solid: Heating water will not cause it to freeze; it would require cooling. This option is incorrect. D.

There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson (Anthony Mackie), and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy. Nine years later, Lincoln decides to get revenge against Barts. He attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam (Rufus Sewell), a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma (Erin Wasson). Sturgess also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, silver, and presents him with a silver pocket watch. In Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), and meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Though Sturgess warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary. Lincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam.

First Championship (1993-1994 season): The first Championship for the Houston Rockets occurred during the 1993-1994 NBA season. The team finished the regular season with a record of 58-24, clinching the second seed in the Western Conference. Coached by Rudy Tomjanovich, the team was led by Hakeem Olajuwon, who would eventually be named the regular season MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP during this season. The Rockets' playoff run began with a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, followed by a win in a hard-fought seven-game series against the Phoenix Suns. The Rockets then emerged victorious in the Western Conference Finals, defeating the Utah Jazz in another intense five-game series. The 1994 NBA Finals saw the Rockets face off against the New York Knicks, who were led by head coach Pat Riley and star center Patrick Ewing. After a gripping seven-game clash that showcased the prowess of both teams, the Houston Rockets emerged as the 1994 NBA Champions, winning their first-ever title after a critical Game 7 triumph on June 22, 1994. The final score in that decisive game was 90-84, with Hakeem Olajuwon playing a monumental role in orchestrating the victory. 2.

All but three of the world's 25 largest volcanic eruptions of the last 11,700 years occurred at volcanoes in the Ring of Fire. The Ring of Fire is a direct result of plate tectonics: the movement and collisions of lithospheric plates, especially subduction in the northern portion. The southern portion is more complex, with a number of smaller tectonic plates in collision with the Pacific plate from the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Bougainville, Tonga, and New Zealand. Question: is new zealand located on the pacific ring of fire? Options are: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"(2). Yes; New Zealand is indeed located on the Pacific Ring of Fire. The Pacific Ring of Fire is a belt of seismic and volcanic activity that surrounds the Pacific Ocean. It is characterized by the presence of multiple tectonic plate boundaries, which results in frequent volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. This ring stretches for around 40,000 kilometers (24,854 miles), covering numerous countries including the United States, Japan, Indonesia, Russia, Chile, and indeed, New Zealand. The Ring of Fire consists mainly of convergent boundaries, where one tectonic plate slides beneath another. This process is called subduction, and it often leads to the formation of volcanic arcs and deep ocean trenches. In the case of New Zealand, it is situated on the boundary between the Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate, which are moving toward each other. This results in both the North and South Islands experiencing regular seismic activities. New Zealand's location along the Pacific Ring of Fire also means that the country is home to numerous volcanoes, both active and dormant. Notably, one of New Zealand's most famous geothermal areas, Rotorua, is part of a larger volcanic zone known as the Taupo Volcanic Zone. This zone includes highly active volcanoes like Mount Ruapehu, Mount Tongariro, and Lake Taupo, which was formed by a volcanic caldera. Additionally, the South Island of New Zealand experiences the effects of the ongoing collision between the Pacific and Australian plates. This tectonic activity is the driving force behind the uplift of the Southern Alps, a mountain range that extends for over 450 kilometers (280 miles) along the western side of the island. Earthquakes caused by the plate interactions are also common in the region. New Zealand's inclusion in the Pacific Ring of Fire also has parallels in its cultural history. The indigenous Māori people of New Zealand have numerous legends and stories that revolve around the powerful natural forces present in their land and its connection to the fiery underground. In conclusion, New Zealand is definitely located on the Pacific Ring of Fire. Its position on the boundary between two tectonic plates contributes to the country's geothermal and volcanic activity, as well as ongoing seismic events such as earthquakes. This natural phenomenon has a significant impact on New Zealand's landscape, ecosystems, and even the cultural history of its people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Although the two questions are related, they are not the same. The first question concerns the suitability of the Golang programming language for embedded systems, while the second question pertains to choosing a suitable Freescale Kinetis MCU as a replacement for an LPC4330 microcontroller. I will address each question in detail below. 1. Is Golang a good language for embedded systems? Golang, also known as Go, is a programming language developed by Google that has gained popularity due to its simplicity, efficiency, and concurrent programming capabilities. Although Go is primarily designed for developing web servers, network programming, and other server-side applications, it may be considered for embedded systems in certain cases. Advantages of using Golang for embedded systems: - Strong concurrency: Go has built-in support for concurrent programming with goroutines and channels, which can benefit real-time embedded systems where tasks have to run concurrently and communicate efficiently. - Garbage collection: Memory management is crucial in embedded systems, and Go offers automatic garbage collection, which helps manage memory without adding significant overhead. - Clean syntax and ease of use: The Go language tries to maintain simplicity and readability, making it easier for developers to understand, maintain, and ensure the reliability of code in embedded systems. - Growing community and libraries: Go has an active community and a growing set of libraries, which can be helpful for building embedded systems, especially as new hardware platforms and peripherals come out. However, there are also certain limitations to using Golang in embedded systems: - Memory footprint: Golang applications can have a larger memory footprint compared to languages such as C or C++, which is not ideal for embedded systems with constrained memory resources. - Limited hardware support: While support for various hardware platforms and peripherals is growing, Go might not yet support the specific hardware used in an embedded system. C and C++, on the other hand, are more widely used in embedded systems, so hardware support is usually more robust. - No real-time capabilities: Golang does not currently offer real-time support, which is critical for certain embedded system applications that require strict timing guarantees. In summary, Golang can be a suitable language for embedded systems in specific situations but might not be the best choice for every application due to its limitations. Languages like C and C++, which are specifically designed for low-level system programming, tend to be more commonly used in embedded systems. However, with a growing community and increasing hardware support, Golang might become more viable for embedded systems in the future. 2. Embedded Systems: Which Freescale Kinetis MCU is a good drop-in replacement for an LPC4330? The LPC4330 microcontroller is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4-based device from NXP Semiconductors, featuring a Cortex-M0 coprocessor, 264 KB of data memory, and a variety of peripherals such as USB, UART, SPI, and I2C. To recommend a suitable Freescale Kinetis MCU as a drop-in replacement, we need to find a microcontroller with similar features, preferably from the ARM Cortex-M4 family, and similar amounts of data memory and peripherals. One candidate is the MK66FN2M0VMD18 from the Kinetis K66 family. This MCU is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4-based device that features: - 180 MHz max CPU frequency - Up to 2 MB of flash memory - Up to 256 KB of SRAM - USB HS/FS/LS controller - UART, SPI, and I2C interfaces - Ethernet capability - SDHC (Secure Digital Host Controller) This microcontroller is suitable as it has a similar ARM Cortex-M4 core, data memory, and peripherals to the LPC4330. However, it might not be an exact drop-in replacement since some differences in the specific peripherals, pinouts, and software libraries may still exist. When replacing an MCU in an embedded system, it's important to verify whether the proposed microcontroller meets the specific requirements of the project, such as power consumption, required peripherals, software support, and tools. Careful comparison of the MCU data sheets and existing development tools is essential in ensuring a smooth transition from one microcontroller to another. In conclusion, the two questions are related but not the same. The first question addresses the suitability of Golang for embedded systems, while the second question examines finding a suitable Freescale Kinetis MCU as a replacement for an LPC4330. Both questions revolve around the topic of embedded systems but focus on different aspects and considerations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process in coal-fired power generation is the mining and preparation of raw coal. This raw coal contains impurities and needs to undergo several stages of treatment before it can be used to generate electricity efficiently. The entire process consists of multiple steps, a few of which include extraction, transportation, and processing of coal. Let's discuss this initial stage in detail. 1. Coal extraction: Coal is primarily extracted through two methods - surface mining and underground mining. The method chosen depends on the depth, geology, and coal type at a specific site. Surface mining, also known as strip mining, is employed when coal seams are located near the surface. This involves removing the layers of soil and rock (called overburden) to expose the coal seam. Heavy machinery like excavators and bulldozers are used to remove the overburden and extract the coal. On the other hand, underground mining is used when coal seams are buried deep in the ground. This method involves digging tunnels or shafts into the earth to reach the coal seams. Miners use various extraction techniques such as room and pillar, longwall, or retreat mining to remove coal from the ground. 2. Transportation: Once the coal is extracted, it is transported to the power plant or processing facility. The mode of transportation depends on the distance between the coal mine and the power plant. For shorter distances, trucks or conveyor belts are used. When the distance is longer, trains or barges play an essential role in transporting the coal. 3. Processing and preparation: Upon arrival at the processing facility, the coal undergoes several treatment processes to remove impurities and improve its overall quality. This begins with breaking the large coal pieces into smaller chunks, usually through the use of crushers or pulverizers. This smaller particle size helps improve burning efficiency in the boilers. Further, the coal is washed in a mixture of water and various chemicals to remove any impurities, such as sulfur, clay, and rock. This process is called coal beneficiation or coal washing, and it results in a cleaner and more efficient fuel source for power generation. Some impurities, like sulfur, are removed to reduce environmentally harmful emissions like sulfur dioxide when the coal is burned. In summary, the first step of the process in coal-fired power generation is the mining and preparation of raw coal, which includes extraction, transportation, and processing to ensure that the coal is of optimal quality to be used in power generation. This is a crucial stage, as it directly impacts the efficiency and environmental performance of coal-fired power plants."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer. and a hint : Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth. Please answer this question : Which temperature will result in slower growth of micro-organisms on the cupcakes?","completion":"To determine which temperature will result in slower growth of micro-organisms on the cupcakes, we need to consider the hint provided. Step 1: Understand the hint The hint tells us that freezing slows down food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Lower temperatures affect reaction rates, and freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth. Step 2: Compare the two temperature options We need to compare 0° F and 10° F to see which temperature will result in slower growth of micro-organisms: Option 1: 0° F At this temperature, the water content in the cupcakes will likely freeze, making it hard for bacteria to access the water for growth. Option 2: 10° F At this temperature, there may still be some traces of unfrozen water content within the cupcakes. This could make it slightly more suitable for bacterial growth compared to 0° F. Step 3: Decide on the best temperature Based on the information from the hint and our comparison, it is likely that storing the cupcakes at 0° F will result in slower growth of micro-organisms.

Windows 10 tip: Use BitLocker to encrypt your system drive Make this lower case","completion":"Windows 10 tip: How to use BitLocker to encrypt your system drive BitLocker is a built-in encryption feature that comes with Windows 10, providing an extra layer of protection by encrypting all the data stored on your system drive. This means that if someone gains unauthorized access to your computer or steals your device, they will be unable to access your personal files or sensitive data without first decrypting the drive, which is almost impossible without the decryption key. In this guide, we will explain step-by-step how to enable and use BitLocker to encrypt your system drive. 1. Check if your PC supports BitLocker: Before you start, ensure your computer supports BitLocker encryption. To do this, type \\"system information\\" in the Windows search bar and press Enter. In the System Information window, look for \\"Device Encryption Support\\" under \\"System Summary.\\" Make sure it says \\"Meets prerequisites,\\" which means your PC supports BitLocker. 2. Open the BitLocker settings: To access BitLocker settings, type \\"BitLocker\\" in the Windows search bar and press Enter. This will open the \\"Manage BitLocker\\" window where you can control encryption settings for your drives. 3. Enable BitLocker for the system drive: In the \\"Manage BitLocker\\" window, locate your system drive (usually the \\"C:\\" drive), and click on \\"Turn on BitLocker\\" to start the encryption process. 4. Choose an unlock method: BitLocker will then ask you to choose an unlock method for your system drive. You have two options: \\"Insert a USB flash drive\\" or \\"Enter a password.\\" If you choose to use a USB flash drive, you'll need to insert one and follow the on-screen instructions to save your BitLocker key to it. If you choose to use a password, create a strong and unique password that you will use to unlock your system drive every time you start your computer. 5. Back up your recovery key: After choosing your unlock method, you will be prompted to save a recovery key. This is a crucial step, as the recovery key acts as a backup in case you ever lose access to your USB flash drive or forget your password. You can save the key as a file on a USB drive, print it, or save it to your Microsoft account. Make sure to keep your recovery key in a safe and secure location. 6. Choose encryption options: Next, you will have to choose between encrypting the entire drive or just the used disk space. We recommend encrypting the whole drive, which will provide more comprehensive protection. However, if you're running low on time, you can choose to encrypt only the used disk space on your drive, which will be faster but less secure. 7. Start the encryption process: After selecting your encryption option, BitLocker will prompt you to restart your computer to begin encrypting your system drive. Click \\"Restart now\\" and wait for your computer to reboot. 8. Encryption in progress: After your computer restarts, the encryption process will begin. This can take a while, depending on the size of your drive and your computer's performance. You can continue to use your computer during the encryption process, but be prepared for it to run slower until the process is complete. 9. Check the encryption status: You can monitor the encryption progress by going back to the \\"Manage BitLocker\\" window. Once the process is complete, your system drive will be encrypted, and you'll need to use your chosen unlock method to access your drive whenever you start your computer. In conclusion, by following these steps, you can successfully enable and use BitLocker to encrypt your system drive, providing an additional layer of security for your sensitive data and personal files. Make sure to keep your recovery key safe, as it's the only backup in case you lose access to your password or USB flash drive containing the decryption key."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Two divers are photographing the wreck of the Orca, Quint's boat from the first film, and are suddenly attacked and killed by a large great white shark, but not before one of the divers' camera gets a photo of the shark's eye. The shark later prowls the coastal waters of Amity Island, killing a female water skier. The female driver of the speedboat tries to defend herself by first throwing a gasoline tank at the shark (accidentally spilling some on herself) and then igniting the fuel with a flare gun. The fire ignites the gas tank and the speedboat explodes, killing the driver and leaving the shark heavily scarred on the right side of his head.In addition to these incidents, a dead killer whale is beached at a nearby lighthouse with large wounds all over its body, which Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) suggests were caused by a great white shark. Once again, Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) doesn't share Brody's belief that the town has another shark problem and warns him not to do something hasty. Later, Brody spots a section of a ruined speedboat bobbing in the surf just off the beach. When he goes to retrieve it, he encounters the burnt remains of the female speedboat driver.Brody angrily grounds his son Mike (Mark Gruner) because of his reluctance to find a summer job, preferring to go sailing every day, and gives him a job at the beach. The following day, while Brody is in an observation tower, he sees a large shadow produced by a school of bluefish, which he mistakes for a shark.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that maintained his position as court painter? Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.Several of Goya's friends, including the poets Juan Meléndez Valdés and Leandro Fernández de Moratín, were overt afrancesados: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as \\"el desmembramiento d'España\\"—the dismemberment of Spain.

The incident has sparked outrage as it highlights the ongoing issue of racial injustice and inequality. The video, which has quickly gained attention on social media platforms, captures the fans shouting offensive comments such as \\"get a job\\" and \\"pull up your pants.\\" In a particularly repugnant moment, the perpetrators are heard shouting \\"Africa!\\" in an attempt to belittle the protesters. The video also highlights the fans chanting \\"Let's go Darren!\\" in clear reference to Darren Wilson, the white police officer behind the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. The inexcusable actions of the Cardinals fans come in the wake of increasing racial tensions and the ongoing issue of police brutality in America. Michael Brown's tragic death on August 9, 2014, became the tipping point, igniting the nationwide \\"Black Lives Matter\\" movement that seeks to address and act against systematic racism and the unjust treatment of the black community by law enforcement. In a time where the fight for equality and justice has gained momentum, incidents like these serve as a stark reminder of the deep-seated prejudice that still permeates our society. The attendees of the baseball game, who should have been focused on enjoying the sport, felt the need to demean and taunt the protesters with racist comments – clearly illustrating that the path to achieving significant progress in the fight for equality is still a long one. As the video continues to circulate and elicit reactions, it is crucial to remember the importance of unity and solidarity in combating racism and injustice. The incident at Busch Stadium offers a valuable opportunity to remind the public that the fight against discrimination and racial prejudice must continue until every individual is treated equally and afforded the same opportunities in our society. Instances of racial prejudice like these cannot go unaddressed. It is essential to call out such actions and advocate for a change in attitude. It is only through meaningful conversation and education, as well as supporting each other in the fight against racism, that we can hope to bring about progress. At this crucial juncture, we must all strive to contribute our voices, individually and collectively, to challenge the deeply entrenched systems that perpetuate racism and inequality. This, in turn, requires each one of us to acknowledge and confront our prejudices to create a more inclusive and fair society for everyone. In conclusion, while the actions of the Cardinals fans at the Busch Stadium have caused offense and ignited outrage, the incident serves as a heartbreaking reminder that the struggle against racism in America continues. The fight for racial justice must be relentless, and we must all work together in pursuit of the common goal: to ensure that our society lifts everyone up, and that no one is left behind due to the color of their skin or their cultural background."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person in whose view the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music? , can you please find it? Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

Write an article that answers the following question: Which team kicked the most field goals in the third quarter?","completion":"Title: Which Team Kicked the Most Field Goals in the Third Quarter? Hello, little friends! Today, we're going to talk about something exciting that happens in football matches. It's called a 'field goal.' A field goal is when a player from one team kicks the ball through the two big, tall posts at the end of the field. When they do this successfully, their team gets points! Now, we're going to find out which team has kicked the most field goals in the third quarter. To make things easier, let's imagine the football game is like a big birthday party. The third quarter is like the party's third fun activity. The first team to kick the most field goals during that activity wins a special prize! Okay, here's the problem. I can't tell you exactly which team has kicked the most field goals in the third quarter right now because that changes every time a new football game is played! To find out the answer, we would have to look at all the football games that have been played and see which team has kicked the most field goals in the third quarters of those games. And guess what? There are lots and lots of football games played every year. But don't worry! You can always find out more about recent games and which teams kicked field goals in the third quarter. You could ask a grown-up to help you search on the internet for the most recent football game results. Once you have found that information, you can compare the teams and see which one had more success during the third quarter. In conclusion, it's important to remember that being good at kicking field goals isn't the only way to win a football game. There are so many other skills that football players need to have, like teamwork, effort, and practice. So, even if a team doesn't have the most field goals in the third quarter, they can still enjoy the game and work hard to become better players! Remember to cheer for your favorite team and enjoy watching those exciting football games every season!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of making hot chocolate without powder, using actual chocolate (either bar or chocolate chips) is the option that makes more sense. Here's a step-by-step process for making hot chocolate with real chocolate: Step 1: Choose the chocolate Select high-quality chocolate bars or chocolate chips that suit your taste preference, such as dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or a combination of both. Step 2: Break or chop the chocolate If using a chocolate bar, break it into small, uniform pieces so it will melt evenly. If using chocolate chips, no further action is needed at this step. Step 3: Heat the milk In a saucepan, gently heat up the desired amount of milk over medium-low heat, making sure not to scald or boil the milk. Use around 1 cup of milk for each serving of hot chocolate. Step 4: Melt the chocolate When the milk is heated, add the chocolate pieces to the saucepan. Stir continuously as the chocolate melts to combine it evenly with the milk. Step 5: Add sweetener (optional) If the chocolate is not sweet enough for your taste, add a sweetener like sugar or honey. Start with small amounts and taste as needed, adjusting the sweetness level to your preference. Step 6: Add flavoring (optional) For additional flavor, you may choose to add vanilla extract, cinnamon, or a touch of sea salt to enhance the taste of your hot chocolate. Step 7: Whisk Once all the ingredients are well-combined, whisk the mixture to create a smooth, frothy texture. Step 8: Serve Pour the hot chocolate into mugs or cups and, if desired, add your favorite toppings such as marshmallows, whipped cream, or a sprinkle of cocoa powder.

Read this: Phytochemistry is a branch of plant biochemistry primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and a wide range of opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Muddy Waters' birthplace and date are not conclusively known. He stated that he was born in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, in 1915, but it is believed to be more likely that he was born in Jug's Corner, in neighboring Issaquena County, in 1913. Recent research has uncovered documentation showing that in the 1930s and 1940s, before his rise to fame, the year of his birth was reported as 1913 on his marriage license, recording notes, and musicians' union card. A 1955 interview in the Chicago Defender is the earliest in which he stated 1915 as the year of his birth, and he continued to say this in interviews from that point onward. Context: Initially, the Chess brothers would not allow Muddy Waters to use his working band in the recording studio; instead, he was provided with a backing bass by Ernest \\"Big\\" Crawford or by musicians assembled specifically for the recording session, including \\"Baby Face\\" Leroy Foster and Johnny Jones. Gradually, Chess relented, and by September 1953 he was recording with one of the most acclaimed blues groups in history: Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums, and Otis Spann on piano. The band recorded a series of blues classics during the early 1950s, some with the help of the bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon, including \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", \\"I Just Want to Make Love to You\\", and \\"I'm Ready\\". Along with his former harmonica player Little Walter Jacobs and recent southern transplant Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters reigned over the early 1950s Chicago blues scene, his band becoming a proving ground for some of the city's best blues talent. Little Walter continued a collaborative relationship long after he left Muddy Waters's band in 1952, appearing on most of the band's classic recordings in the 1950s. Muddy Waters developed a long-running, generally good-natured rivalry with Wolf. The success of his ensemble paved the way for others in his group to make their own solo careers. In 1952, Little Walter left when his single \\"Juke\\" became a hit, and in 1955, Rogers quit to work exclusively with his own band, which had been a sideline until that time. During the mid-1950s, Muddy Waters' singles were frequently on Billboard magazine's various Rhythm & Blues charts including \\"Sugar Sweet\\" in 1955 and \\"Trouble No More\\", \\"Forty Days and Forty Nights\\", and \\"Don't Go No Farther\\" in 1956. 1956 also saw the release of one of his best-known numbers, \\"Got My Mojo Working\\", although it did not appear on the charts. However, by the late 1950s, his singles success had come to an end, with only \\"Close to You\\" reaching the chart in 1958. Also in 1958, Chess released Muddy Waters' first album, The Best of Muddy Waters, which collected twelve of his singles up to 1956. Question: What helped Muddy Waters gain commercial success ?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Muddy Waters gained commercial success because he started working with a very talented group of musicians, like Little Walter Jacobs, Jimmy Rogers, Elga Edmonds, and Otis Spann. They recorded many popular blues songs together, some with the help of bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon. Muddy Waters and his band became famous in the early 1950s Chicago blues scene, and their success helped other band members to start their own solo careers too, which made their music even more popular."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: During the period of North–South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household had about 5.1 people at that time, the city had more than 1.4 million residents. Now answer this question: During the time of the North–South division, how many households were in Nanjing?","completion":"During the period of North–South division, when Nanjing served as the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries, the city was a significant international hub for East Asia. Its prominence marked it as a center of culture, commerce, and administration. The extent of these contributions to world civilization is highlighted by the magnitude of its population during this period. Based on the historical records, it can be inferred that the city had a highly substantial number of households. Specifically, Nanjing was home to around 280,000 registered households during this period. These households comprised individuals who may have contributed to the city's vibrant life in various capacities. As merchants, artisans, bureaucrats, scholars – their interactions would have shaped the city's socioeconomic fabric and fueled its growth and development. The existence of such a large number of households is also reflective of a bustling urban environment with a high degree of organization and systemic complexity related to administrative functions such as registration and taxation. It is a testament not only to Nanjing's importance as a hub in East Asia but also to its capacity to host such a significant number of residents within its confines. Extrapolating from this, given an average Nanjing household had about 5.1 people at that time, it is plausible that the city had more than 1.4 million residents. The population composition of these households could have included a broad demographic spectrum, from children to elderly, with diverse professions and socioeconomic statuses. This demographic mix would have further contributed to the city's multilayered cultural milieu, manifest in its architecture, festivals, linguistic practices, art forms, and culinary traditions. In summary, during the period of the North–South division, the city of Nanjing had 280,000 registered households, highlighting its central role in East Asia's geopolitical landscape and its status as a thriving urban center with a substantial populace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The process you have described represents the sediment transportation cycle, which occurs due to natural forces like wind and water. Sediment transportation plays a significant role in shaping the Earth's landscape and creating new landforms. Now, let's examine the situation where there are more calm, unwindy days than usual and how it affects the sediment transportation process. When there are fewer windy days, it means that wind as a natural agent for sediment transportation is less active. This can have the following effects on the overall sediment transportation: 1. More sediment being transported: Less effect. With fewer windy days, there might be less wind to pick up and transport sediment particles. Consequently, sediment transportation by wind may decrease. However, the sediment can still be transported through other means, such as water. Water, especially in the form of rivers, streams, and ocean currents, can be a powerful force that significantly contributes to sediment transportation. Depending on the overall weather conditions and availability of water sources, the decrease in wind transportation may be compensated by the increased contribution of water in sediment transportation. So, the overall effect on the amount of sediment being transported may not be significantly impacted. 2. Influence on the second effect - sediment breaking down into small particles: No effect. Calm and unwindy days should have no impact on the breakdown of sediment into smaller particles. The breakdown of sediment usually occurs due to processes like weathering, erosion, and mechanical actions like freezing and thawing, or even plant roots breaking up rocks and soil particles. These processes are more related to temperature changes, water infiltration, and biological processes than wind conditions. In summary, more calm and unwindy days may have less effect on the process of sediment transportation, primarily by reducing the contribution of wind as a transportation agent. However, the overall transportation of sediment may still happen due to the action of water. Furthermore, there is no effect on the second stage of the process, where sediment breaks down into small particles, as this stage is determined by other factors unrelated to wind conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The Jubilee Line on the London Underground map is depicted by a distinct grey colour. This colour has been associated with the line since its inception and allows passengers to easily identify and follow its course throughout the map. The Jubilee Line, named in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee in 1977, was officially opened in 1979. It covers a significant section of the London Underground network, stretching approximately 22.5 miles (36.2 kilometers) and serving 27 stations in total, from Stanmore in the northwest to Stratford in the east. Although you can find the grey Jubilee Line present throughout the iconic London Underground map, it is crucial to note that the map itself is not geographically accurate. Created by Harry Beck in 1931, it was designed to be more of a schematic representation, prioritizing readability and simplicity. Consequently, this map successfully communicates information about station locations, line routes, and interchange options in a clear and concise manner, which has not only helped millions of commuters navigate the London Underground system with ease but has also influenced transportation map designs worldwide. Returning to the topic of line colours on the London Underground map, each line is marked by a unique colour to differentiate it from other lines. For instance, the Central Line is red, the District Line is green, and the Bakerloo Line is brown. Using these colours consistently helps riders associate a line with its hue and, in turn, map their desired route in a more effortless manner. Moreover, these coloured lines have become intrinsically linked to the identity of the London Underground. When you envision the Jubilee Line, grey is the colour that comes to mind, showcasing just how significant this colour-coded system is in terms of usability and as a design choice. In summary, the Jubilee Line's unmistakable grey tone on the London Underground map is vital in making the map easily understandable while also assisting its users in planning their journeys effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that Leonard Tresilian wanted to leave his estate to? is inside the article: The history of Gilwell Park can be traced to 1407, when John Crow owned Gyldiefords, the land that would eventually become Gilwell Park. Between 1407 and 1422, Crow sold the land to Richard Rolfe, and the area became known as Gillrolfes, \\"Gill\\" being Old English for glen. Following Rolfe's death in 1422, different sections of the property came to be called \\"Great Gilwell\\" and \\"Little Gilwell\\". The two areas were named after the Old English \\"wella\\", or spring. A farmhouse has stood at Gilwell Farm ever since. Around this time, an adjoining 5.6 hectares (14 acres) property was purchased by Richard Osborne. In 1442, he built a large dwelling called Osborne Hall, which stood for 300 years. Legend has it that in the early 16th century, King Henry VIII owned the land and built a hunting lodge for his son Edward. Around 1736 the highwayman Dick Turpin began using Gilwell's forests to conceal himself and for ambushing travellers and freight along roads leading into London.In 1754, William Skrimshire purchased Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell, and half of Osborne's estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall. That building is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time, but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?–1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings and size of the residence. Tresilian's first wife, Margaret Holland, died young after bearing three daughters. He then married Elizabeth Fawson. Desiring that Gilwell pass on to his eldest daughter, also named Margaret (1750 – c.1844), Tresilian drew up a detailed prenuptial agreement with Fawson's father. By the time of Tresilian's death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766–1834), the elder brother of the painter George Chinnery., can you guess it ?

To understand this, it is essential to analyze the meanings and relationships between the two sentences. Sentence 1: Experience This sentence implies that the subject has gained knowledge, skill, or practical understanding through involvement or exposure to situations, events, or activities. This could include professional experience, life experience, or skills in a specific field. It usually refers to a person who has acquired a certain level of expertise or competence in an area. Sentence 2: Inexperience This sentence signifies the opposite of the first sentence. It directly refers to a lack of knowledge, skill, or practical understanding in a field or subject. Inexperience implies that a person has not yet acquired much expertise or competence in a given area, suggesting that they may be unfamiliar with or new to the field, or they may have limited exposure or involvement in specific situations. Entailment occurs when the truth of one sentence guarantees or strongly indicates the truth of another. In this case, the first sentence (Experience) does not entail or guarantee the truth of the second sentence (Inexperience). In fact, these two sentences represent conflicting or contradictory ideas. The first sentence refers to a state of possessing knowledge, skill, or understanding, while the second sentence describes a state of lacking that same knowledge, skill, or understanding. Since the two sentences represent opposite concepts, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence.

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse.

What are the facts about the ability of a fish to see? Can they tell the difference between colors? The sharp hearing of a fish has been proved by two scientists, who trained a fish to expect its food when it heard the sound of a whistle. And a slight sound two hundred feet away could drive fishes away. That should make fishermen start thinking. One scientist had made experiments to prove fish can recognize different colors such as red, brown, yellow and green. Fish also have an eye for different shapes. One scientist proved this by teaching fish to connect certain patterns with food. He used a small circle and a square. If the fish swam towards the circle, they received food as a reward. If they swam towards the square, they received nothing. The fish learned in time to go to the circle but not to the square. Does this mean that in time fish might learn to leave alone all food on hooks that they have seen often before? Here is something for all fishermen to think about! These facts help to make more believable some of the \\"believe it or not\\" stories that have been told about fish. It is clear that fish have sometimes shown their ability to gain knowledge as man does. A good example of what we might call \\"thinking\\" by a fish is given by an experience of Dr. Andrew Gage. Fishing over a bridge, he hooked a fish. It struggled and dragged the line two hundred feet away before he stopped it. Then it swam back to the bridge. The clever fish then swam round a pile and, with a sudden push, broke the line. If the story ended there, one could say that the fish had freed itself by chance. However, Gage went on fishing. Below him he could see the fish that had broken loose. After another twenty minutes the fish again seized the food on the hook. This time it did not swim out but swam round one of the piles and again broke the line. Many stories are told of the fish that get away and the clever \\"old hand\\" ones that can't be caught.

Stereolab's music combines a droning rock sound with lounge instrumentals, overlaid with sing-song female vocals and pop melodies, and have also made use of unorthodox time signatures. It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock, experimental rock, and experimental pop.The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently features Moog synthesizers. Lætitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music. In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in Wire that Sadier \\"display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico\\", while some critics have commented that her vocals were unintelligible.

Q: how does increased friction affect the actual mechanical advantage of a machine? A:","completion":"Increased friction affects the actual mechanical advantage of a machine by reducing its efficiency. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this occurs: 1. Mechanical advantage (MA) is the ratio of output force produced by a machine to the input force applied on it. The ideal mechanical advantage (IMA) assumes there is no friction or other sources of energy loss. 2. In real-world scenarios, friction is always present, and it opposes the motion of various components in a machine. This results in energy loss in the form of heat or noise. 3. Due to friction, some of the input force is used to overcome the resistance offered by the frictional forces, leaving less force available to be converted into useful work (output force). 4. This leads to the actual mechanical advantage (AMA) being less than the ideal mechanical advantage (IMA). The AMA considers the effect of friction and other energy losses. 5. When friction increases, more input force is required to overcome it. As the input force to counteract friction increases, the force available for useful work (output force) decreases. 6. Consequently, the actual mechanical advantage (AMA) decreases as the friction increases, making the machine less efficient in transforming the input force into desired output force. The difference between IMA and AMA is more significant in systems with higher friction. In summary, increased friction negatively affects the actual mechanical advantage of a machine by reducing its efficiency to convert the input force into a useful output force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unfortunately, my visit to The Hungry Diner left me feeling disappointed and unimpressed. Step 2: Commenting on the atmosphere and staff Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed the place was dimly lit and the decor outdated. There was also a peculiar smell that made it difficult to enjoy our meal. The staff seemed disinterested in providing quality customer service, taking an excessive amount of time to seat us despite the restaurant being nearly empty.

So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who told his friend that he could certify that the offensive smell have been of the most head-and-stomach distending nature? from the following article ? By mid-1858 the problems with the Thames had been building for several years. In his novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was \\"a deadly sewer ... in the place of a fine, fresh river\\". In a letter to a friend, Dickens said: \\"I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature\\", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that \\"in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep\\" on the Thames foreshore, and that \\"the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter\\". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged 34–36 °C (93–97 °F)—rising to 48 °C (118 °F) in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained on the banks of the river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event \\"The Great Stink\\"; the leading article in the City Press observed that \\"Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it\\". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a \\"pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination\\", while a second wrote that \\"the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream\\". The leading article in The Illustrated London News commented that: We can colonise the remotest ends of the earth; we can conquer India; we can pay the interest of the most enormous debt ever contracted; we can spread our name, and our fame, and our fructifying wealth to every part of the world; but we cannot clean the River Thames.

While accepting a patron award at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation’s third annual Patron of the Artists Awards on Thursday night in Beverly Hills, the “Star Is Born” actress called on Hollywood to provide better mental health care for people in the entertainment business. In a nearly 25-minute speech, she detailed her own “mental health crisis” that prompted her to seek professional help after becoming overwhelmed by work commitments. “I began to notice that I would stare off into space and black out for seconds or minutes,” Gaga recalled. “I would see flashes of things I was tormented by, experiences that were filed away in my brain with ‘I’ll deal with you later’ for many years because my brain was protecting me, as science teaches us. These were also symptoms of disassociation and PTSD and I did not have a team that included mental health support.” She explained that her struggles “later morphed into physical chronic pain, fibromyalgia, panic attacks, acute trauma responses, and debilitating mental spirals that have included suicidal ideation and masochistic behavior.” Gaga, who has been open about being a survivor of sexual assault, suggested that SAG-AFTRA partner with her Born This Way Foundation to implement mental health programs for union members. She even said she would make an unspecified donation to launch the initiative. “I wish there had been a system in place to protect and guide me, a system in place to empower me to say no to things I felt I had to do, a system in place to empower me to stay away from toxic work environments or working with people who were of seriously questionable character,” Gaga said. “There were days that I struggled or couldn’t make it to work and I don’t want that for other artists or anyone.” She ended her remarks by declaring, “Let’s change the f—ing world!” Calling mental health issues a “crisis of epic proportions,” she said, “We need to bring mental health into the light. We need to share our stories so that global mental health no longer resides and festers in the darkness.” “It is dangerous and we know this because amongst other shootings and acts of violence — just last night there was a shooting in Thousand Oaks by a veteran who was believed to have suffered from untreated post-traumatic stress disorder, which is a mental health issue,” she added. Also honored during the night’s program were Harrison Ford, Spike Lee, and Jeffrey Katzenberg. The evening also included performance by Kristin Chenoweth, Dave Koz, Adam Lambert, Ledisi, and Arlissa. ||||| Lady Gaga is using her platform to push for something bigger than acting or singing — mental health care. The A Star Is Born actress, 32, was honored Thursday night at the SAG-AFTRA Patron of the Artists Award fundraiser, and used her acceptance speech to speak openly about her “debilitating mental spirals” that led her to seek help. Get push notifications with news, features and more. Gaga said her mental health problems became more severe as her star rose. “After years and years of saying yes to jobs, interviews, events — all opportunities, of course that I am so humbled and grateful to have had, because I know that there are so many who have not — and after working as hard as I possibly could to achieve my dreams, slowly but surely the word yes — ‘Yes, sure’ — became too automatic and my inner voice shutdown, which I have learned now is very unhealthy,” she said. “I was not empowered to say no.” The singer said that it felt like she would “blackout for seconds or minutes” as her brain pushed off things she had to do, and she would “see flashes of things I was tormented by.” She developed a “list” of worrying symptoms. “There were also symptoms, symptoms of dissociation and PTSD, and I did not have a team that included mental health support,” she said. “This later morphed into physical chronic pain, fibromyalgia, panic attacks, acute trauma responses, and debilitating mental spirals that have included the suicidal ideation and masochistic behavior. Okay. I’m done with my list, but that list changed my life. And it changed my life not in a good way.” Lady Gaga at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation's 3rd Annual Patron of the Artists Awards Steve Granitz/WireImage Gaga said that her mental health struggles were left for too long. “I’m telling you this because for me it was too late,” she said. “I needed help earlier. I needed mental health care. I needed someone to see not through me or see the star that I’d become but rather see the darkness inside that I was struggling with.” With her health now manageable, she wants to use her experience to make sure it doesn’t happen to anyone else. “I wish I had mental health resources then because although what I have is treatable and can hopefully and will get better over time, if there was preventative mental healthcare accessible to me earlier, I believe it might not have gotten as bad as it did,” she said. “I wish there had been a system in place to protect and guide me. A system in place to empower me to say no to things I felt I had to do. A system in place to empower me to stay away from toxic working environments or working with people that were of seriously questionable character.” RELATED VIDEO: Prince William and Lady Gaga Meet Up for FaceTime Chat About Mental Illness: ‘We’re Not Hiding Anymore’ “There were days I struggled or couldn’t make it to work, and I don’t want that for other artists, or for anyone, so what I’m really trying to say it is I wish that I had you when I was 19,” she continued. “Not only because I wished I had a SAG card, but that I also would have a mental health program within the industry that could have prevented some of the trauma that I experienced.” Gaga first opened up about her mental health in Dec. 2016, when she revealed her battle with PTSD during a visit with a group of homeless LGBTQ teens in New York. “I told the kids today, ‘I suffer from PTSD.’ I’ve never told anyone that before. So here we are,” she said at the time. “But the kindness that’s shown to me by doctors as well as my family, and my friends, it’s really saved my life.” And two years later, in September, she said the PTSD stems from a sexual assault she suffered at age 19. “No one else knew. It was almost like I tried to erase it from my brain. And when it finally came out, it was like a big, ugly monster. And you have to face the monster to heal,” she told Vogue. “For me, with my mental health issues, half of the battle in the beginning was, I felt like I was lying to the world because I was feeling so much pain but nobody knew,” she said. “So that’s why I came out and said that I have PTSD, because I don’t want to hide—any more than I already have to.” |||||","completion":"Lady Gaga addressed the importance of mental health care within the entertainment industry at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation's third annual Patron of the Artists Awards in Beverly Hills.

He is the youngest child of Viswanathan Nair, a former bureaucrat and law secretary with the Kerala Government, and Santhakumari. He grew up at Mudavanmugal, Poojappura, at his paternal house in Thiruvananthapuram. Mohanlal studied at Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Thiruvananthapuram and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Mahatma Gandhi College in Thiruvananthapuram. Mohanlal made his acting debut in 1978 with the film Thiranottam, which was produced and made by Mohanlal and his friends--Maniyan Pilla Raju, Suresh Kumar, Unni, Priyadarshan, Ravi Kumar and a few others. Mohanlal played Kuttappan, a mentally disabled servant. Due to some issues with censorship, the film was not released on time. It took 25 years to release the film. In 1980, Mohanlal was cast in the lead antagonist role in Manjil Virinja Pookkal - the directorial debut of Fazil. The film became a major success. Mohanlal's friends had sent his application in response to an advertisement released by Navodaya Studio. He auditioned for the role in front of a panel that included professional directors. Displeased with his appearance, two of them gave him poor marks, but Fazil and Jijo Appachan gave him 90 and 95 marks out of 100. In an interview with Reader's Digest in 2004, Mohanlal said that his looks as a young man might have fit the villain's image. By 1983, Mohanlal was credited in more than 25 feature films, most of them had him playing negative (villain) roles. Films such as Ente Mohangal Poovaninju, Iniyengilum, Visa, Attakkalasham, Kaliyil Alpam Karyam, Ente Mamattukkuttiyammakku, Engane Nee Marakkum, Unaru and Sreekrishna Parunthu changed his image. Through Sasikumar's Ivide Thudangunnu, he became a successful hero with a \\"good heart\\". Mohanlal played his first comic lead role in an ensemble cast in the 1984 comedy Poochakkoru Mookkuthi, directed by Priyadarshan, as a young man in love with a girl whom he mistakenly believes to be rich. It also marked the beginning of the Mohanlal-Priyadarshan duo, who as of 2016, have worked together in 44 films. In 1985, he recorded a song for the film Onnanam Kunnil Oradi Kunnil. Uyarangalil, Nokketha Doorathu Kannum Nattu, Boeing Boeing and Aram + Aram = Kinnaram were some of his films in this period. Did he have another acting role after Thiranottam?","completion":"Yes, Mohanlal had numerous acting roles after Thiranottam. Following his debut in 1978, Mohanlal went on to have an illustrious career in the film industry. In 1980, he starred as the lead antagonist in Manjil Virinja Pookkal, which became a major success and marked the beginning of his career as a professional actor. Over the years, Mohanlal has appeared in more than 340 films in various roles and genres. After the success of Manjil Virinja Pookkal, Mohanlal appeared in many noteworthy roles in films like Ente Mohangal Poovaninju, Iniyengilum, Visa, Attakkalasham, Kaliyil Alpam Karyam, Ente Mamattukkuttiyammakku, Engane Nee Marakkum, Unaru, and Sreekrishna Parunthu. These films helped him transition from negative roles (villain) to that of a heroic protagonist. His first comic lead role was in the 1984 comedy Poochakkoru Mookkuthi, directed by Priyadarshan. This film marked the beginning of the Mohanlal-Priyadarshan duo, a highly successful collaboration that, as of 2016, has produced 44 films together. Mohanlal has showcased his talent in various genres, including drama, action, and comedy. His ability to seamlessly transition between roles has played a significant role in making him one of India's most revered and respected actors. Some of his other notable films throughout his career include Uyarangalil, Nokketha Doorathu Kannum Nattu, Boeing Boeing, Aram + Aram = Kinnaram, Vanaprastham, and Drishyam.

President Donald Trump often likes to point out how different he is from his White House predecessors in terms of style and substance. But it is unlikely any past president would envy the legal challenges facing Trump, from the Russia investigation to Stormy Daniels to the scrutiny law enforcement is giving his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. On Tuesday it was a night of pomp and glamor at the White House as President Donald Trump and Mrs. Trump welcomed French President Macron and his wife for a state dinner. The two presidents got along famously during their White House meetings. The only damper on the day came when both men were in the Oval Office and a reporter asked Trump about the legal difficulties facing his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen. \\"Mr. President, what about Michael Cohen? Are you considering a pardon for Michael Cohen?\\" asked ABC correspondent Jonathan Karl. After a pause, the president responded. \\"Stupid question,\\" he said dismissively. Cohen is under scrutiny for a payment to an adult film star. Stormy Daniels says it was hush money to keep her quiet about a brief affair she had with Trump in 2006, a claim the president has denied. Trump has frequently complained about the recent FBI raids on Cohen's home and office and the ongoing Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier this month Trump spoke up during a meeting with military officials at the White House. \\"Here we are talking about Syria, we are talking about a lot of serious things with the greatest fighting force ever, and I have this witch hunt constantly going on for over 12 months now.\\" Several legal analysts have said the increased scrutiny of Trump's long relationship with Cohen could become a serious problem for the president. \\"There has been no suggestions that Cohen has nothing that he could say, which suggests that they know that Cohen actually does possess information that could be damaging to Trump or the Trump organization more generally as a legal matter,\\" said George Washington University Law...

According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence indicates that the C-Group and Kerma peoples spoke Afroasiatic languages of the Berber and Cushitic branches, respectively. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". When can the Berber be dated back to?","completion":"The article does not provide a specific date for the origin of the Berber people or their language. However, it does mention that the C-Group pastoral culture, to which the Berber-speaking people are linguistically related, inhabited the Nile Valley between 2500-1500 BC. Some sources date the C-Group culture back to 3500 BC. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Berber language and people can be dated back to at least 2500-1500 BC, and possibly as early as 3500 BC."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - The Sol Duc River (also spelled Soleduck) is a river in the U.S. state of Washington. About long, it flows west through the northwest part of the Olympic Peninsula, from the Olympic Mountains of Olympic National Park and Olympic National Forest, then through the broad Sol Duc Valley. Near the Pacific Ocean the Sol Duc River joins the Bogachiel River, forming the Quillayute River, which flows about to the Pacific Ocean at La Push. Although the Quillayute River is short, its large tributary riversthe Sol Duc, Bogachiel, Calawah, and Dickey Riversdrain the largest watershed of the northern Olympic Peninsula, . The Sol Duc's watershed is the largest of the Quillayute's tributaries, at . - The Olympic Mountains are a mountain range on the Olympic Peninsula of western Washington in the United States. The mountains, part of the Pacific Coast Ranges, are not especially high Mount Olympus is the highest at ; however, the eastern slopes rise out of Puget Sound and the western slopes are separated from the Pacific Ocean by the wide Pacific Ocean coastal plain. The western slopes are the wettest place in the 48 contiguous states. Most of the mountains are protected within the bounds of the Olympic National Park. - The Olympic Peninsula is the large arm of land in western Washington that lies across Puget Sound from Seattle. It is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, the north by the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the east by Hood Canal. Cape Alava, the westernmost point in the contiguous United States, and Cape Flattery, the northwesternmost point, are on the peninsula. Comprising about 3600 square miles, the Olympic Peninsula contained many of the last unexplored places in the contiguous United States. It remained largely unmapped until Arthur Dodwell and Theodore Rixon mapped most of its topography and timber resources between 1898 and 1900. - The Quillayute River (also spelled Quileute River) is a river situated on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington. It empties to the Pacific Ocean at La Push, Washington. The Quillayute River is formed by the confluence of the Bogachiel River, Calawah and the Sol Duc River. The Dickey River joins the Quillayute just above the river's mouth on the Pacific Ocean. - Olympic National Park is a United States national park located in the state of Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. The park has four basic regions: the Pacific coastline, alpine areas, the west side temperate rainforest and the forests of the drier east side. Within the park there are three distinct ecosystems which are sub-alpine forest and wildflower meadow, temperate forest, and the rugged Pacific Shore. These three different ecosystems are in pristine condition and have outstanding scenery. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The Bogachiel River is a river of the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. It originates near Bogachiel Peak, flows west through the mountains of Olympic National Park. After emerging from the park it joins the Sol Duc River, forming the Quillayute River, which empties into the Pacific Ocean near La Push, Washington. - A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas. - Olympic National Forest is a U.S. National Forest located in Washington, USA. With an area of , it nearly surrounds Olympic National Park and the Olympic Mountain range. Olympic National Forest contains parts of Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, and Mason counties. The landscape of the national forest varies, from the temperate Olympic rain forest to the salt water fjord of Hood Canal to the peaks of Mt. Washington. - The Dickey River is a stream on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. It has three main forks, the East Fork, West Fork, and Middle Fork Dickey Rivers. The main stem is formed by the confluence of the East and West Forks. The river and its forks rise in the northwestern part of the Olympic Peninsula and flow generally south and west to join the Quillayute River near its mouth on the Pacific Ocean. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Sol Duc Hot Springs is a resort located in Olympic National Park that is best known for its soaking pools , hot tubs , and a swimming pool that are heated with the nearby hot springs .

News article: Paul Ryan has been seeking the group's endorsement. | AP Photo Ryan to proceed with speaker bid He says he's prepared to move ahead despite not securing the formal endorsement of the Freedom Caucus. Rep. Paul Ryan will proceed with plans to run for House speaker despite not securing the formal endorsement of the House Freedom Caucus. Ryan's decision, which came after a high-stakes meeting with the group of hard-line conservatives earlier in the day, all but ensures that the Ways and Means Committee chairman will succeed John Boehner as Republican leader at the end of the month. Story Continued Below “I’m grateful for the support of a supermajority of the House Freedom Caucus. I look forward to hearing from the other two caucuses by the end of the week, but I believe this is a positive step toward a unified Republican team,” Ryan said in a statement. Roughly two-thirds of Freedom Caucus members vowed to back Ryan for the top leadership job during a meeting of the group Wednesday night. Its internal rules, however, dictate that 80 percent of members are needed to issue a formal endorsement. Ryan had said Tuesday night that he would not run for speaker without the backing of all the major caucuses in the Republican Conference. But the difference within the House Freedom Caucus between an actual endorsement and overwhelming support was not enough to deter Ryan from seeking the job. \\"We tried to reach a consensus but we were not able to reach the 80 percent threshold,\\" said Freedom Caucus board member Rep. Raúl Labrador of Idaho, referring to the threshold needed to endorse a candidate. \\"There is some consensus that it's time for us to move forward. We're trying to move forward in a positive way. It's an offer of support.\\" The prospect of a Speaker Ryan clearly splintered the group that caused Boehner constant headaches in the job and ultimately push him to resign. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a Republican from Kansas, said he has no intention of voting for Ryan. He said Florida Rep. Daniel Webster, the group's earlier pick for the job, has a longer record than Ryan of reforming legislators and provided a clear plan to “empower our members.” Webster was the speaker of the House in Florida. Ryan declared that he wants the endorsements of the Freedom Caucus, the moderate Tuesday Group and the Republican Study Committee before mounting his bid. The RSC will endorse Ryan, sources in the group said, and the Tuesday Group is sure to as well. House Freedom Caucus leaders have been leaning in Ryan’s favor since he announced Tuesday that he’d run for speaker under several conditions. Lawmakers like Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Marlin Stutzman of Indiana wanted the caucus to endorse Ryan, sources said, but were unsure the entire conservative group would get behind him. “He has the votes. If the man wants to be speaker, I think he now has the votes to do it,\\" Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) said before Ryan announced he would proceed. Stutzman said he began whipping his fellow Freedom Caucus members throughout the day Wednesday to support Ryan, who is widely considered at the only Republican able to secure 218 votes in an election of the full House. “Paul Ryan is completely capable and is willing to make some of the changes we need. I trust Paul Ryan,” Stutzman said. There are still some issues the Freedom Caucus wants to hammer out. Ryan initially proposed broad changes to a procedural move called a \\"motion to vacate,” which essentially allows a rank-and-file member to attempt to oust the speaker. Conservatives balked when they thought Ryan wanted to do away with that rule, but Ryan later clarified he meant changing the vote threshold — a compromise Freedom Caucus sources said they’re willing make. There will also be discussion about other changes to House rules, but the Freedom Caucus members who agreed to back Ryan did so without any formal pledges from him on reforms. Even Labrador — who said he will vote for Ryan on the floor — cautioned that the process would be an ongoing conversation for the Freedom Caucus. “This is not about crowning a king, this is about working together,” he said. The Republican Conference and then the full House are scheduled to vote for speaker next week. ||||| The House Freedom Caucus (HFC) stopped short of formally endorsing Rep. Paul Ryan for Speaker on Wednesday but said a “super-majority” of the group backs him, handing the Wisconsin Republican enough votes to win the top leadership post. About two-thirds of the conservative group backs Ryan for the Speakership — just shy of the 80 percent threshold needed for the caucus to issue a formal endorsement, said Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho), a co-founder and spokesman for the roughly 40-member bloc of conservatives. “A super-majority of the Freedom Caucus has agreed to support Paul Ryan,” Labrador told reporters after an hour-long, closed-door caucus meeting. \\"The ball is now in Paul Ryan's court.” ADVERTISEMENT Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee who has served for the past year in his dream job as Ways and Means Committee chairman, said he was grateful for the overwhelming support from the Freedom Caucus and signaled he was moving forward with his bid. “I look forward to hearing from the other two caucuses by the end of the week, but I believe this is a positive step toward a unified Republican team,” Ryan said in a statement. Earlier this week, Ryan said he wouldn't launch a bid for Speaker unless he won endorsements from three major GOP caucuses: the HFC, Republican Study Committee (RSC) and the centrist Tuesday Group. Both the RSC and Tuesday Group are expected to back Ryan. He meets with the Tuesday Group at 10 a.m. on Thursday. “My guess is he could still get 230-plus votes, and in this environment that is remarkable,” Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.), a Ryan backer and a member of the GOP leadership team, told The Hill on Wednesday night. “He’s the best person to lead us forward, and despite some of the media portrayal, he has repeatedly expressed a willingness to change the way we do business,” Messer added. Outgoing Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) set an internal election to nominate his successor for Oct. 29, with a formal floor vote a day later. Boehner said he plans to resign from Congress in the middle of his third term as Speaker on Oct. 30 after the HFC threatened to force a vote to remove him from power. Numerous HFC members predicted Wednesday's vote would be the last the group will take on the question of Ryan's speakership. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said Ryan now has sufficient support to win the Speakership — he needs just 218 votes to win a simple majority of the entire House. HFC members said they did not accede to one of Ryan's key demands: watering down a procedural tactic that allows members to call for a vote to oust a sitting Speaker. But lawmakers exiting Wednesday night’s meeting said they had no problem with Ryan’s request to cut back on weekend fundraising trips to spend time with his young family. There is some disagreement within the HFC about what Wednesday's vote means for the group's earlier endorsement of Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.). Amash, another HFC co-founder, said the caucus has not strayed from its initial position. \\"We haven't rescinded our endorsements, but we've made a statement of support” for Ryan, Amash said. Rep. John Fleming (R-La.), however, interpreted Wednesday's actions differently, saying the Webster endorsement \\"is negated by this\\" vote on Ryan. Ryan received roughly 70 percent of the HFC votes, according to several lawmakers. That falls short of the 80 percent threshold to formally endorse a candidate, Amash said, but he called it “a high number.” \\"Paul appears to have sufficient support to become the next Speaker of the House, even if there is a minority of House Freedom Caucus members who don't support his bid,\\" Amash added. \\"He'll have to make the decision on how he proceeds.\\" Fleming agreed. \\"We have a supermajority that's supporting him, will vote for him,\\" he said. \\"Whether he moves forward is up to him.\\" Fleming clarified that the figures represent the percentages of the total number of HFC members, not just those in attendance Wednesday night. He put the total membership of the group at 39 lawmakers, with Wednesday's attendance in \\"the 30s.\\" Amash said, \\"Roughly all of our members voted. … It's possible there was a member or two that was absent today.\\" He said he doesn't know the exact number of votes Ryan fell short, but \\"it's a small number.” The HFC released a statement Wednesday night calling Ryan “a policy entrepreneur who has developed conservative reforms dealing with a wide variety of subjects.” “While no consensus exists among members of the House Freedom Caucus regarding Chairman Ryan's preconditions for serving,” the group said, “we believe that these issues can be resolved within our Conference in due time.” Updated at 9:38 p.m. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Paul Ryan is a man who wants to be the leader of a group called the House of Representatives, which helps make decisions for the United States.

(Associated Press) The two campaigns were ready to leave matters in the hands of voters and their schedules left little doubt where the election would be won or lost. Obama was holding rallies in Wisconsin and Iowa on Monday. Romney was cutting a broader swath, with events in Florida, Virginia and New Hampshire. But the richest prize is Ohio, and both Obama and Romney were rallying their supporters in its capital, Columbus. Whoever wins Ohio has a simpler path to amass the 270 electoral votes needed to claim the presidency. With national polls showing the two candidates locked in a virtual tie, the outcome in a handful of key states will determine who occupies the White House for the next four years. For Obama, Iowa, Wisconsin and Ohio are his firewall. \\"I think it's going to hold firm,\\" Vice President Joe Biden told a rally in Ohio Sunday. Victories in those three states, barring a huge upset in a state like Pennsylvania, would virtually assure him re-election. \\"I think we're going to win clearly,\\" Biden said. Romney voiced more guarded optimism. In Cleveland, discussing the chances of Obama's re-election, Romney said, \\"It's possible, but not likely.\\" A final national NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll showed Obama getting the support of 48 percent of likely voters, with Romney receiving 47 percent. A Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll had Obama at 49 and Romney at 48. A Pew Research Center poll released Sunday showed Obama with a three-point edge over Romney, 48 percent to 45 percent among likely voters. Defying the odds, Romney drew one of his largest crowds Sunday in Pennsylvania, a state where Obama was holding onto a lead but where Romney aides said they detected soft support for the president. Despite a delayed arrival, Romney rallied thousands on a farm in a Philadelphia suburb on a cold night, taking the podium as loudspeakers blared the theme from \\"Rocky.\\" The sign of energy in a key swing area of the state was only tempered by some early exits by supporters seeking to escape the cold. Meanwhile, about 30 million people have already voted in 34 states and the District of Columbia, either by mail or in person, although none will be counted until Election Day on Tuesday. More than 4 million of the ballots were cast in Florida, where Democrats filed a lawsuit demanding an extension of available time. A judge granted their request in one county where an early voting site was shut down for several hours Saturday because of a bomb scare. Both men were spending the final days of the campaign presenting themselves as can-do leaders willing to break partisan logjams in Washington. The former Massachusetts governor warned that a second Obama term would threaten the American economy because of the president's inability to work with Congress. \\"He's ignored them, he's attacked them, he's blamed them,\\" Romney said. Obama cited bipartisan work on middle-class tax cuts and on ending the Pentagon's don't-ask-don't-tell policy, but warned that he would not compromise away his priorities, such as health care. \\"I'm not willing to pay that price,\\" he said. At stops, Obama has been telling crowds, \\"If you want to break the gridlock in Congress, you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way, whether they are Democrats or Republicans or independents.\\" But the local candidates he often cites are inevitably Democrats. As the race approached its conclusion, the two candidates engaged in their own personal moments with friends and close aides, an acknowledgement that no matter who won, this was the end of the campaign. Longtime Obama chums Mike Ramos, a childhood friend from Hawaii, and Marty Nesbitt, a friend from Chicago, joined the president on Air Force One. On Monday, longtime adviser and former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs and former personal aide Reggie Love were to join the entourage. Aboard Air Force One, the president also was making calls to Democratic candidates to wish them well, including Senate contender Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts. Obama will also benefit from some star power Monday. Rock legend Bruce Springsteen is joining him at all three campaign rallies, and rapper Jay-Z will join them in Columbus. Romney, for his part, has appeared more relaxed on the campaign trail, where he's been joined by most of his longtime senior aides. Much of the planning and strategy is finished, they say, and they wanted to spend the final days of the campaign at Romney's side. Adviser Kevin Madden said Romney was spending much of his time working on his laptop, reading and writing in his journal. The Republican candidate also recently joined his aides in an hour-and-a-half discussion about their favorite movies. Romney's? \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou,\\" which stars Obama pal George Clooney. As aides for both candidates looked for early marks of success, there were signs for the superstitious. Since 1936, with only one exception, whenever the Washington Redskins won on the Sunday before the election, the incumbent party would retain the White House. On Sunday, the Redskins lost to the Carolina Panthers, giving hope to Republicans. But the Obama camp often compares this election to 2004, when President George W. Bush held the White House in his race against Democrat John Kerry. That year was the exception to the rule; the Redskins lost, and so did Kerry. ___ Associated Press writers Julie Pace in Madison, Kasie Hunt and Steve Peoples in Pennsylvania and Stephen Ohlemacher in Washington contributed to this report ___ Follow Jim Kuhnhenn on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/jkiuhnhenn ||||| On Sunday, it appeared that Romney’s task was getting a little harder. A pair of national polls seemed to show that it was Obama who had a bit of momentum in the race’s last weekend. A Washington Post-ABC News poll showed the president at 49 percent to Romney’s 48 percent. The tracking poll has had both candidates locked within a narrow band for weeks, although Romney held a brief three-point edge in late October. Another poll, released Sunday by the Pew Research Center, found Obama with a three-point lead nationwide among likely voters, 48 percent to 45 percent. A week ago, the same poll had the two candidates tied. The Pew poll found that Hur­ricane Sandy may have given Obama a boost: Sixty-nine percent of likely voters approved of the president’s handling of the storm. Meanwhile, a poll late Sunday by CNN showed the race deadlocked at 49 percent. Beyond the polls, data on early voting seemed to show Democrats with an edge in several key states, although not as wide as the advantages Obama held four years ago. Nonetheless, Romney and his aides said they were confident of victory. The Republican made a striking gesture of that confidence by visiting Pennsylvania, a state long assumed to be in Obama’s column and one that has not voted for a GOP presidential candidate in more than two decades. A top aide, Ed Gillespie, said Romney has “expanded” the map of this election and expects to compete in the Keystone State. Taking the stage to the “Rocky” theme before a crowd of about 30,000 in Morrisville, Romney declared that “this audience and your voices are being heard all across the nation. . . . We’re taking back the White House, because we’re going to win Pennsylvania!” The night was so cold that, after Romney was an hour late because of air-traffic delays, people became too chilly and demanded to be let out. Authorities lifted the security fences, and scores filed out while the candidate spoke. On Sunday, the two campaigns held 14 events in eight states, including six in the battleground of all battlegrounds, Ohio. At one point, the two sides got close enough to see each other: As Air Force Two prepared to take off from the Cleveland airport on Sunday afternoon, Vice President Biden spotted Romney’s campaign plane across the tarmac. For both candidates, it was a day of big crowds — and final goodbyes. In the morning, Obama visited New Hampshire for the seventh time during the general-election season after campaigning here extensively four years ago. This, presumably, was his last visit as a candidate. He spoke to a crowd of 14,000 in Concord, the state capital, with former president Bill Clinton. ||||| All around him, aides who as recently as a month ago had been steeling themselves for defeat, murmuring that they had never really envisioned a job in the White House anyway, are now allowing themselves to privately muse about what life in Washington would be like.

At a rally on Friday night, Mr. Romney stood before more than 20,000 cheering Ohioans, with his five sons sitting off to the side in red or navy “Romney-Ryan” fleeces. “Tonight we entered the final weekend of the campaign,” Mr. Romney told supporters in West Chester. “At Obama rallies, they’re saying, ‘Four more years.’ We have a different cry, of course. What is it?” The crowd began chanting: “Four more days! Four more days!” “Exactly right,” Mr. Romney said. He knows, of course, that it could all end for him on Tuesday inside a ballroom at the Boston Convention Center, a prospect that would snuff a decade’s climb through the ranks of American politics. He is 65, and it is hard to imagine a third presidential campaign. But for now, he seems to be willing himself into the presidency, as much for the confidence of his staff as for motivating the undecided voters who may glimpse him on television. On Friday, he started to read the line of a speech loaded into his teleprompter for a rally at a warehouse in West Allis, Ohio. “I want to help the hundreds of thousands of dreamers,” the prepared text had him saying. “I will.” He decided to tweak the wording. “When I am president,” he added, his voice rising, “I will.” He has pushed for a closing campaign message that outlines his plans for “Day One” in the White House — a phrase that now appears on his signs and podiums and in his stump speech. In private conversations with staff members, he has begun dropping references to “January,” as he envisions how he might govern. “This is a person who realizes that the presidency is within his grasp,” said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser who has worked with Mr. Romney for the past decade. The changes in Mr. Romney’s mood and demeanor over the past few weeks are subtle, those close him to say. Mr. Romney has never been known for Clintonian eruptions of emotion. But he now exudes a new and unmistakable confidence. At the end of a giant rally, held a few days ago at a high school football field in Land O’ Lakes, Fla., Mr. Romney did something unusual for him. He raced through an open corridor on the field, both arms extended as he high-fived the eager voters, celebrity style. “You don’t see Mitt walk into a donor meeting slapping high fives,” Mr. Fehrnstrom said. “It’s just a very different mood and feel.” Photo Mr. Romney started the fall with an unhurried public schedule of just a few events a week, bogged down with fund-raising commitments and reluctant to plunge too quickly into the sleepless, barnstorming phase of the race. Now, he is cramming three or four events into each day, a wearying regimen that has occasionally become apparent in his hoarse voice and verbal slips. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At a rally in Des Moines on Sunday, Mr. Romney flubbed one of his signature stump speech lines: “Employment is higher today than when Barack Obama took office,” he said, accidentally substituting “employment” for “unemployment.” Recalling his visit late last week with the owner of a struggling barbecue restaurant in Richmond, Va., he blanked on the company’s age. “She said, ‘We’re closing down for good after 82 years’ — was it 62 or 82?” he said. “Well, it’s one of the two. After 62 or 82 years, she’s closing down.” To limit exhaustion-induced errors, Mr. Romney is increasing his use of teleprompters in the last days of the race, aides said.

In Ohio last week, he broke from his usual script to reflect on the exhausting work of running for president. “This job,” he said, “is quite an undertaking.” Later, he talked about the difficulty of relaxing after hectic hours of campaigning. “I get so much energy from you, by the way, that at the end of the day, it takes me a long time to slow down and fall asleep,” he told thousands of people on a field in Davenport, Iowa. Two years into the race, Mr. Romney’s interior life remains something of a mystery — not just to voters but even to some of his aides. He seems capable of truly unwinding only in the company of his family. He eschews the raucous staff dinners and late-night strategy huddles that are a staple of campaign life. At night, he sometimes eats alone in his hotel room, savoring his solitude over takeout that aides order from nearby restaurants. Aboard his plane, he devotes little time to chitchat. “He just goes right to his seat, takes out his iPad and gets to work,” said Kevin Madden, a senior adviser. He makes a point of talking to his wife, Ann — who is keeping her own slightly less demanding schedule of rallies and talks — every day in conversations squeezed in on the plane just before takeoff, in his sport-utility vehicle between events or at night back in his hotel room. On Sundays, he calls each of his five sons — all of whom have been campaigning with him recently — to check in, sometimes patching them into a conference call. He is a careful student of the race that has enveloped his life. When he boards the front cabin of his campaign plane each morning, aides have already arranged the local and national newspapers on the table before him. He is a scanner of headlines and photos, not a cover-to-cover reader, they said. (“Four Days to Seal the Deal,” was the first headline he saw Friday, on the cover of USA Today.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story On the plane that now doubles as his home on the road, he stocks peanut butter, honey and whole wheat bread, the components of his go-to sandwich. Hidden away, in an overhead bin or a nearby fridge, are his guilty pleasures: granola bars, pita chips, Kit Kats, Snickers and Greek yogurt with honey. (“The Greek yogurt industry has got to have a boost, just from the front of the plane,” Mr. Madden said.) In the waning days of the race, Mr. Romney’s world has become smaller and ever more tightly controlled. He no longer ventures to the press cabin of his plane, as he used to, apparently fearing an encounter that could change the contours of the race. After the third presidential debate, reporters asked Mr. Madden if Mr. Romney might hold a news conference to talk about the last days of the campaign. Mr. Madden scoffed: if you want to know what the candidate thinks, he said, listen to his speeches. “The door to a brighter future is there, it’s open, it’s waiting for us,” Mr. Romney likes to say at the end of his speeches now. “I need your vote, I need your help. Walk with me, walk together.” On Saturday, he surrounded himself with his entire team of top advisers, who made a rare joint appearance on his plane for the closing 72 hours of the race. Many of them have worked with him since his days in the Massachusetts Statehouse, and he wanted them by his side. Over the weekend, he took out his iPhone and began to surreptitiously record video of his aides asleep in their seats. As he prowled the cabin, laughing quietly to himself, he seemed to understand that come Tuesday, win or lose, this chapter of his life would be over. ||||| It appears that President Obama is likely to go into Election Day with a very modest lead in the average of national polls. As of this writing, on Sunday evening, Mr. Obama led by an average of 1.3 percentage points across 12 national polls that had been published over the course of the prior 24 hours. The range was quite tight, running from a tied race in the polls issued by Rasmussen Reports, CNN and Politico, to a three-point lead in three other surveys. Photo This happens to be a reasonably friendly group of polls for Mr. Obama, and it’s more likely than not that at least some national polls published late Sunday or on Monday will still show Mitt Romney ahead. Nevertheless, there is enough data to conclude that Mr. Obama probably has a slight edge from national surveys, which until recently had pointed toward a tie — or perhaps a modest advantage for Mr. Romney in the immediate aftermath of the Denver debate. A number of these polls had very large sample sizes, meaning that the results are less likely than usual to have resulted from statistical variance. But the modest gains that Mr. Obama has made in the high-profile national surveys should not be that much of a surprise. We’ve observed the race shifting toward him over the past two to three weeks in polls of swing states, where overwhelming majorities of polls have had Mr. Obama ahead over the past few days. Where has Mr. Obama shown a bit of weakness in his numbers? His polls in noncompetitive states have been mediocre lately. In polls published by the online firm YouGov on Sunday, for example, there were declines in Mr. Obama’s numbers in California and Texas. Since these states have large populations, they could lower Mr. Obama’s popular vote even though they will play no role in his Electoral College tally. The forecast model still does perceive some differences between the state polls and national polls, but it is within a reasonable range. Perhaps more important, the fact that the national polls now suggest a slight lead for Mr. Obama removes one of the better reasons to think that our forecast might have been underrating Mr. Romney’s chances. Based on the simulations that we ran on early Sunday evening, for example, Mr. Obama would have an 85 percent chance of winning the Electoral College if the popular vote were exactly tied nationally. This is where Mr. Obama’s Electoral College advantages, particularly in Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin, would be of their maximum benefit. Given a tied national popular vote, we would expect Mr. Obama to underperform his polls slightly in these states — but since he leads by a minimum of about three points in the polling average in each one, he could underperform those numbers and still win them. Mr. Obama would be almost certain to win the Electoral College if he won the popular vote by a percentage point or so. Photo Instead, the model estimates that Mr. Romney would need to win the national popular vote by about one percentage point to avert a tossup, or a loss, in the Electoral College. A tied popular vote, as Mr. Romney’s better national surveys now indicate, would likely yield an unhappy outcome for him. Mr. Romney would not be in much danger of losing the Electoral College if he won the popular vote by more than about 1.5 percentage points. For example, he would be about a 95 percent favorite in the Electoral College if he won the popular vote by two percentage points, according to the forecast model. But with national polls now showing a slight edge for Mr. Obama, these outcomes have become less likely. If Mr. Romney wins the popular vote, it may be only barely, and that might not be enough for him to win the Electoral College. The consolidation between the national polls and state polls is also important outside the context of the FiveThirtyEight forecast model itself, since it removes a source of structural uncertainty — the chance that the model was not a good representation of the real world. While I think the model handles the relationship between state polls and national polls in a careful way, there are a lot of alternative assumptions that one might make, and so it had been a source of some inherent ambiguity. On Saturday, we wrote that state polls would have to be statistically biased against Mr. Romney for him to win the Electoral College. Now, it may be the case that the national polls would have to be biased against him as well. ||||| “This is my last debate,” he said after squaring off a third time with Mitt Romney. The “lasts” piled up on a bone-weary final weekend as he raced from Ohio to Wisconsin, Iowa to Virginia, New Hampshire to Florida and back to Ohio, then Colorado and Wisconsin again. What he hopes most is that these are not the last days of his presidency. “You can see the nostalgia, the wistfulness, setting in,” observed Dan Pfeiffer, one of his longest-serving advisers and now the White House communications director. “The focus here is winning and making the case, but the last campaign of a man’s life — you every once in a while pause and think about that.” Other than a brief interlude for Hurricane Sandy, the White House has been relocated to Air Force One for months. Mr. Obama half-jogs off the plane and half-jogs onto the stage, his coat off, his sleeves rolled up, his tie usually gone. He has grown hoarse arguing his case. Between stops, he huddles in the plane’s conference room, nursing his throat with tea and scratching out his speech in longhand. His daily routine has been upended, but he tries to keep up his workout regimen in hotel fitness centers. He eats whenever he can, usually whatever the Air Force stewards are serving aboard the plane or something brought in before a speech. Occasionally, when he stops to glad-hand at a pizza place or a doughnut shop, he may snack in the motorcade to the next campaign rally; at a Cleveland meat shop, he bought barbecue jerky. He is happier whenever he gets time with Michelle Obama, but she has largely kept a separate schedule. Like any father on the road, he makes sure to call his wife and children every evening. To keep him company in recent weeks, friends like Marty Nesbitt and Mike Ramos have accompanied him aboard Air Force One. Between conference calls on storm recovery on Sunday, he checked out the Chicago Bears football game on the Air Force One television. The other day, Mr. Obama landed in Chicago to vote and spotted his former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, now the city’s mayor, waiting on the tarmac. A huge grin appeared on the president’s face, and he pointed at Mr. Emanuel. The mayor grinned and pointed back. The two embraced like long-lost brothers and chatted happily before walking, arm in arm, to shake hands with bystanders. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “He’s got his goal in eyesight, and he’s driving to the basket,” Mr. Emanuel said later. “He’s a happy warrior, I’d say.” Photo Happier with the debates over. He considered preparations for the first one “a drag,” as he put it, and got walloped. It was an eye-opener for a president who has never lacked confidence, a moment when he “faced his own political mortality,” Mr. Pfeiffer said. “The first debate turned a switch for him. He came out of that very focused on ensuring that would never happen again.” By his own reckoning, Mr. Obama had failed to “communicate why he wants a second term,” said another adviser. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who played Mr. Romney during debate rehearsals, said Mr. Obama recognized the peril. “He just decided in his mind that he needed to bear down and win, period,” Mr. Kerry said in an interview. “He’s a competitive guy. He’s very analytical. He knows exactly what he had not done and exactly what he wanted to do.” After coming out stronger in the later debates, Mr. Obama could finally return to the trail, where the affirmation of the crowd beats the pounding of the pundits. The crowds are smaller — he drew 24,000 here in Bristow, compared with 60,000 and 80,000 in his final days in 2008 — but they are enthusiastic, and he draws energy from them. “The president seemed relaxed,” said former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, who campaigned with him in that state. “You don’t see a lot of anxiety or frenetic behavior.” Mr. Obama seems to enjoy his unannounced stops even more, allowing a tiny peek into his interior life. At the Common Man restaurant in Merrimack, N.H., he met a woman with two daughters. “You can’t beat daughters,” he said, reflecting on his own, who were, he added, still at a good age: “They still love you. They’re still cute. They don’t talk back too much.” One of his favorite stops was the employee cafeteria at the Bellagio hotel and casino in Las Vegas, where he greeted kitchen workers and room cleaners. “For him, that was the people he’s fighting for,” Mr. Plouffe said later. “He loves stuff like that. That was a unique one.” It made such an impression that Mr. Obama was still talking about it a day later. “That thing at the Bellagio yesterday was great,” he told reporters on Air Force One. Then, recalling that his press secretary’s van broke down, he joked, “I think every trip we’re going to find at least one occasion to ditch Jay Carney.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Very rarely does Mr. Obama confront the nearly half of America that polls say do not support him, those who blame him for the economic troubles still afflicting the country. He seemed taken aback at Cleveland’s West Side Market when he asked a chicken vendor how business was going. “Terrible since you got here,” the man said. The vendor later told his local newspaper he had meant only that the president’s party had blocked his business that day. But he inadvertently voiced the frustrations of many Americans. Nor has Mr. Obama faced many tough questions lately, like those about the response to the attack in Benghazi, Libya, since he generally does not take questions from the reporters who trail him everywhere. Instead, he sticks to generally friendlier broadcast interviews, sometimes giving seven minutes to a local television station or calling in to drive-time radio disc jockeys with nicknames like Roadkill. With Michael Yo, a Miami radio host, he revealed his first job — Baskin-Robbins, “paid minimum wage” — and addressed a feud between Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj: “I’m all about bringing people together,” he said. He relishes rare moments away from politics. He had dinner one night at a Washington restaurant with several swing-state Democrats who had won a contest to meet the president. He had done his homework; he knew their names and their children’s names. But as he tucked into a dinner of salmon, asparagus and potatoes — he left most of the potatoes — he was eager not to dwell on the campaign. “We didn’t really talk about politics very much,” said Kimberley Cathey, 41, a speech language pathologist from North Carolina. “I don’t recall really in the hour and a half we talked anything major about the election,” said her husband, Ron, also 41. “It was pretty much a night away from that.” The president did contemplate the possibility of defeat, but said he and his family “would be fine no matter what the outcome,” Ms. Cathey said. Mario Orosa, 44, a technical specialist at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio, said he had asked Mr. Obama, “What was the last thing that made you really nervous?” The president replied, “I don’t remember.” He is not a nervous man. But even his famous cool may be challenged on Tuesday night. For the “prop,” it is all over but the waiting, while Mr. Plouffe makes some calls and bothers some more folks. ||||| Summary:","completion":"In the final day of the 2012 presidential contest, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney focused intensely on Ohio, which held significant importance for both candidates on their path to the 270 electoral votes needed to claim the presidency. National polls showed a virtual tie, with the outcome hinging on a handful of key states. Both candidates spent the final days presenting themselves as can-do leaders willing to break partisan gridlock in Washington. The campaign saw strong support for both candidates from their respective parties, as well as notable endorsements from influential celebrities, demonstrating the passionate and divisive nature of the race.

Something strange is going on in Britain. Some of the biggest TV stars of the 20th century are donning luscious wigs and scaring the wits out of children. And Queen Elizabeth isn't in a position to stop them either -- she's guilty of joining in herself. Overweight men are squeezing themselves into dresses, young women are prancing about on stage incessantly slapping their own thighs, and everywhere families are wildly screaming \\"He's behind you!\\" It doesn't make any sense. But then, that's pantomime -- or \\"panto\\" as the British fondly refer to it -- a musical comedy unleashed across theaters every Christmas season and like nothing you've ever seen before. Imagine your favorite childhood fairy tale -- \\"Peter Pan,\\" \\"Cinderella,\\" or \\"Robin Hood.\\" Now subvert it with cross-dressing, topical references, audience participation, big song and dance routines, and you've pretty much got the idea. Small stage, big names. But wait. What's this? Recently panto has been getting a celebrity makeover. Once the realm of local actors, now international stars are getting involved. Henry Winkler, better known as \\"The Fonz,\\" from TV show \\"Happy Days,\\" and David Hasselhoff, better known as, er, \\"The Hoff,\\" are wearing Renaissance wigs, badly drawn mustaches, and 45 kilograms of embroidered velvet as they bring to life one of the most infamous panto characters of all -- Hook. \\"For me, there's no other part,\\" said 68-year-old Winkler, who has been playing the Peter Pan villain since 2006, resurrecting him again at London's Richmond Theater this year. \\"All of a sudden you just hear the tiniest voice on the planet either yelling 'Booooo' or 'Peter! He's behind yoooouuu.' Then when Peter is banishing me from Neverland you hear this voice go 'Yay!' and I turn to where it's coming from and say 'Well, I didn't like you much either.' It's just great.\\" Read this: Step inside master clown's fairy tale home. And it's true, one of the great joys of panto is seeing the audience erupt with lines that have been passed down through generations; youngsters standing on their seats to yell \\"Oh yes he is!\\" while parents laugh at the sexual innuendo flying just above their heads. \\"It's not the kind of theater-going experience where you have to sit still and shut up and feel that you have to be very educated to understand,\\" said professor Katherine Newey, chair in theater history at the University of Exeter. \\"I think one of the joys of seeing it with children is that you've got an excuse to be a child again.\\" English eccentricity.

If you don't make that animated, you will get swallowed up and then I would just be lost. So the movement is very calculated. It's a very important part of bringing the character to life.\\" Rich tradition. Today, panto is seen as a uniquely Christmas tradition, but it wasn't always the case. \\"Pantomime as we know it now really emerges in the second half of the 19th century,\\" said Newey. \\"The original pantomimes had an opening scene, generally a fairy tale, with characters which wore these big masks and were often quite satirical of contemporary politics or events.\\" When Victorian writer Charles Dickens began writing about Christmas and pantomime, the two became cemented in the national psyche, with panto even spreading to other Commonwealth nations. And with many Britons having Boxing Day -- December 26 -- off work, it became an ideal time of year to enjoy the show. With The Fonz and The Hoff now tackling panto, does that finally make it cool? \\"I never knew it wasn't,\\" says Winkler. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Pantomime, or \\"panto\\" as it is affectionately called by the British, is a unique theatrical form that appears during every Christmas season. It involves taking popular fairy tales and subverting them with cross-dressing, topical jokes, audience participation, and song and dance routines. Traditionally performed by local theater troupes, pantomime has seen a celebrity makeover in recent years, with TV stars such as Henry Winkler (The Fonz) and David Hasselhoff taking part in famous productions. Pantomime's origins can be traced back to the 19th century, but its association with Christmas began when the famous Victorian writer, Charles Dickens, wrote about the festive season and pantomime. This form of entertainment became closely tied to the British holiday season, especially with the tradition of having Boxing Day off work, giving families an opportunity to see a panto performance. This unique form of theater, with its humor and eccentricity, has become ingrained in British culture. Panto allows the audience to participate and enjoy the show without having to sit still and be quiet, bringing out the inner child in many viewers. Even Queen Elizabeth has participated in pantomime, revealed by old photographs showing her in costume as Prince Florizel in a palace production of \\"Cinderella\\" in 1941. With the recent influx of celebrities taking part in pantomimes, this traditional British pastime continues to grow in popularity, showcasing an eccentric, enjoyable, and uniquely British form of entertainment enjoyed by millions during the festive season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - In fashion, midriff is a term for the human abdomen. The midriff is exposed when wearing a crop top or some forms of swimwear. The cholis worn by Indian women exposes a thin section of midriff, usually 3 to 4 inches. - Satin is a weave that typically has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave is characterized by four or more fill or weft yarns floating over a warp yarn or vice versa, four warp yarns floating over a single weft yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies on top of the weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are \\"floated\\" over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a \\"satin\\", although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen. - Fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body, or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers. Because the more technical term \\"costume\\" is regularly linked to the term \\"fashion\\", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while \\"fashion\\" generally means clothing, including the study of it. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous. - Lingerie are women's undergarments, and may imply their being fashionable and alluring. - A crop top (also cropped top, belly shirt, half shirt, midriff shirt, midriff top, tummy top, short shirt, and cutoff shirt) is a top, the lower part of which is high enough to expose the waist, navel, or some of the midriff. The cropping of a top in this manner is generally limited to female garments. Bikinis and sports bras are generally not regarded as crop tops. - A camisole is a sleeveless undergarment for women, normally extending to the waist. The camisole is usually made of satin, nylon, or cotton. - Undergarments are items of clothing worn beneath outer clothes, usually in direct contact with the skin, although they may comprise more than a single layer. They serve to keep outer garments from being soiled or damaged by bodily excretions, to lessen the friction of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, long underwear is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of undergarments have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, such as T-shirts and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as undergarments and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or textile, some undergarments can serve as nightwear or swimsuits, and some are intended for sexual attraction or visual appeal. - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - Nylon is a generic designation for a family of synthetic polymers, more specifically aliphatic or semi-aromatic polyamides. They can be melt-processed into fibers, films or shapes. The first example of nylon (nylon 6,6) was produced on February 28, 1935, by Wallace Carothers at DuPont's research facility at the DuPont Experimental Station. Nylon polymers have found significant commercial applications in fibers (apparel, flooring and rubber reinforcement), in shapes (molded parts for cars, electrical equipment, etc.), and in films (mostly for food packaging).<ref name=\\"Materials/Polyamide\\"></ref> - A bustier ( alternately bustiere ) is a form - fitting garment for women , which is traditionally worn as lingerie . Its primary purpose is to push up the bust by tightening against the upper midriff and forcing the breasts up , while gently shaping the waist . Nowadays , it might also be worn as a push - up bra under a low - backed dress , or as a camisole for outerwear . The bustier can also be worn as a half - slip under sheer upper garments if a bold display of the midriff is not desired . A bustier resembles a basque , but it is shorter . It reaches down only to the ribs or waist . Modern bustiers are often made with mesh panels rather than the traditional boning . - A choli (Hindi Nepali: , , , \\"ravike\\" Tamil: , Telugu: (ravike), although choli is the preferred word Telugu Kannada: ) is a midriff-baring blouse or upper garment in the Indian sari costume worn in India, southern Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and other countries where the sari is worn. It is also part of the ghagra choli costume of India. - Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus \\"Gossypium\\" in the family of \\"Malvaceae\\". The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will tend to increase the dispersal of the seeds. What is the relationship between 'bustier' and 'undergarment'?","completion":"The relationship between 'bustier' and 'undergarment' lies in the fact that a bustier is a type of undergarment designed specifically for women. Both terms pertain to the category of clothing items that are worn beneath outer clothes and in direct contact with the skin. A bustier is a form-fitting garment that is traditionally worn as lingerie. Its main purpose is to push up the bust by tightening against the upper midriff and forcing the breasts upwards while gently shaping the waist. It can also be worn as a push-up bra under low-backed dresses or as a camisole for outerwear. It is similar to a basque in appearance but is shorter, reaching only down to the ribs or waist. Modern bustiers are often made with mesh panels instead of traditional boning, which makes them more comfortable and adaptable to various body shapes. Undergarments, on the other hand, encompass a wide range of clothing items that are worn beneath outer clothes and serve various purposes, such as keeping outer garments from being soiled or damaged by bodily excretions, reducing friction between outerwear and the skin, shaping the body, providing concealment or support, and even offering a sense of appeal or attraction in some cases. In summary, a bustier is considered an undergarment and is a specific type of undergarment designed for women to provide support and shaping to the bust and waist areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Johann Georg Leopold Mozart (November 14, 1719 May 28, 1787) was a German composer, conductor, teacher, and violinist. Mozart is best known today as the father and teacher of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and for his violin textbook \\"Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule\\". - Naples (Neapolitan: \\"Napule\\" or ; meaning \\"new city\\") is the capital of the Italian region Campania and the third-largest municipality in Italy, after Rome and Milan. In 2015, around 975,260 people lived within the city's administrative limits. The Metropolitan City of Naples had a population of 3,115,320. Naples is the 9th-most populous urban area in the European Union with a population of between 3 million and 3.7 million. About 4.4 million people live in the Naples metropolitan area, one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea. - Leonardo Vinci (1690 27 May 1730) was an Italian composer, best known for his operas. - Josef Mysliveek (9 March 1737 4 February 1781) was a Czech composer who contributed to the formation of late eighteenth-century classicism in music. Mysliveek provided his younger friend Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with significant compositional models in the genres of symphony, Italian serious opera, and violin concerto; both Wolfgang and his father Leopold Mozart considered him an intimate friend from the time of their first meetings in Bologna in 1770 until he betrayed their trust over the promise of an operatic commission for Wolfgang to be arranged with the management of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. He was close to the Mozart family, and there are frequent references to him in the Mozart correspondence. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. - Bologna (; ) is the largest city (and the capital) of the Emilia-Romagna Region in Northern Italy. It is the seventh most populous city in Italy, located in the heart of a metropolitan area (officially recognized by the Italian government as a \\"città metropolitana\\") of about one million. - Johann Adolph Hasse (baptised 25 March 1699 16 December 1783) was an 18th-century German composer, singer and teacher of music. Immensely popular in his time, Hasse was best known for his prolific operatic output, though he also composed a considerable quantity of sacred music. Married to soprano Faustina Bordoni and a great friend of librettist Pietro Metastasio, whose libretti he frequently set, Hasse was a pivotal figure in the development of \\"opera seria\\" and 18th-century music. - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (; 27 January 1756 5 December 1791), baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. - A concerto (from the , plural \\"concerti\\" or, often, the anglicised form \\"concertos\\") is a musical composition, whose characteristics have changed over time. In the 17th century, \\"sacred works for voices and orchestra were typically called concertos.\\" J. S. Bach \\"was thus reflecting a long-standing tradition when he used the title 'concerto' for many of the works that we know as cantatas.\\". But in recent centuries, up to the present, a concerto is a piece usually composed in three parts or movements, in which (usually) one solo instrument (for instance, a piano, violin, cello or flute) is accompanied by an orchestra or concert band. - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully. - A violin concerto is a concerto for solo violin (occasionally, two or more violins) and instrumental ensemble, customarily orchestra. Such works have been written since the Baroque period, when the solo concerto form was first developed, up through the present day. Many major composers have contributed to the violin concerto repertoire, with the best known works including those by Bach, Bartók, Beethoven, Brahms, Bruch, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Paganini, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, and Vivaldi. Traditionally a three-movement work, the violin concerto has been structured in four movements by a number of modern composers, including Dmitri Shostakovich, Igor Stravinsky, and Alban Berg (in the latter, the first two and last two movements are connected, with the only break coming between the second and third). In some violin concertos, especially from the Baroque and modern eras, the violin (or group of violins) is accompanied by a chamber ensemble rather than an orchestrafor instance, Vivaldi's \\"L'estro armonico\\", originally scored for four violins, two violas, cello, and continuo, and Allan Pettersson's first concerto, for violin and string quartet. - Artaserse is the name of a number of Italian operas , all based on a text by Metastasio . Artaserse is the Italian form of the name of the king Artaxerxes I of Persia . There are over 90 known settings of Metastasio 's text . The libretto was originally written for , and first set to music by Leonardo Vinci in 1730 for Rome ( Artaserse ) . It was subsequently set by Johann Adolph Hasse in 1730 for Venice and in 1760 for Naples , by Gluck in 1741 for Milan , by Chiarini in 1741 for Verona , by Graun in 1743 for Stuttgart , by Terradellas in 1744 for Venice , by Galuppi in 1749 for Vienna , by Johann Christian Bach in 1760 for London , by Josef Mysliveek in 1774 for Naples ( Artaserse ) , by Marcos Portugal in 1806 for Lisbon and many other times . The text was often altered . Thomas Arne 's 1762 Artaxerxes is set to an English libretto that is based on Metastasio 's . Mozart 's aria for soprano and orchestra \`\` Conservati fedele '' ( K. 23 , 1765 ) is set to the parting verses of Mandane ( Artaserse 's sister ) at the end of the first scene . The opera was famously performed in 1734 as a pastiche , featuring songs by various composers such as Johann Adolf Hasse , Attilio Ariosti , Nicola Porpora and Riccardo Broschi . It was in this that Broschi 's brother , Farinelli , sang one of his best - known arias , \`\` Son qual nave ch'agitata '' . - A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral. - Pietro Antonio Domenico Trapassi, better known by his pseudonym of Pietro Metastasio (3 January 1698 12 April 1782), was an Italian poet and librettist, considered the most important writer of \\"opera seria\\" libretti.

There are a few factors to consider before arriving at a conclusion. First, the premise itself is not entirely clear and lacks specific context or details. It generally points toward internal tensions or conflicts within the Arab world but does not specify the nature or extent of these disagreements. Additionally, it does not provide any information regarding the news stories about an Arab coalition, their sources, or their overall reliability. This makes it difficult to deduce whether the news coverage on this topic is accurate or misleading. Second, the term \\"Arab coalition\\" can refer to various contexts, collaborations or even historical alliances between Arab countries or groups. Without knowing the specific context or subject matter, it is not possible to determine whether the statement is accurate or not. For instance, there have been instances in the past where Arab countries have formed coalitions or alliances for specific purposes or mutual interests, such as military efforts, economic cooperation, or political support. In these cases, a coalition might be considered \\"real,\\" depending on the level of cooperation and the goals achieved. Nevertheless, it is also true that the Arab world is marked by a broad spectrum of political, religious, cultural, and socio-economic differences. These differences can lead to competing interests and internal conflicts that would weaken the idea of a unified Arab coalition. In some cases, these conflicts could even supersede regional alliances and result in fragmentation or disintegration of such coalitions. Considering the available information and precluding the limitations of the provided premise, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the hypothesis is true or false.

Samuel being short. Robert was able to reach the bottle that was on the top shelf unlike Samuel, due to Samuel being short. Determined not to let his height hold him back, Samuel quickly came up with a plan. Step 1: Assess the situation - Samuel considered why Robert could reach the bottle on the top shelf while he couldn't. The issue was clearly because of their height difference. Samuel noticed that there was a sturdy stool in the corner of the room.

Step 5: Monitor and adjust the plan as necessary - As Samuel stood on the stool and reached for the bottle, he noticed that it was still just a bit too high for him to grip. He considered the other items in the room and decided to add a book under his feet for extra elevation. After carefully placing the book onto the stool, he stepped up again. This time, Samuel was able to reach the bottle comfortably and achieve his goal. Samuel, feeling triumphant in overcoming his short stature, gently grasped the bottle and brought it down, showing Robert that he wasn't so limited after all.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. run around left thrice after turn right twice","completion":"To break down the command, let's first identify the main components based on the definitions. 1. \\"turn right twice\\" refers to the base command: I_TURN_RIGHT twice, which means to execute the action I_TURN_RIGHT two times. 2. \\"run around left thrice after\\" is the next chunk of the command. \\"Run\\" is the base action here: I_RUN. 3. \\"around left thrice\\" modifies the I_RUN action: to run around left thrice, you need to execute I_TURN_LEFT, then I_RUN three times. Now, let's assemble the sequence of actions: 1. First, follow the \\"after\\" and execute \\"turn right twice\\": I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT 2.

Out of fear, Oskar never fights back. In the evenings, however, he sits in the courtyard rehearsing knife attacks on his tormentors. One evening, Oskar notices a new girl about his age and her father moving into into #15, the apartment next door to his. Oddly, the first thing they do is to cover the windows with cardboard. What Oskar doesn't know is that Håkan(Per Ragnar) is not Eli (Lina Leandersson)'s father... he is her renfield... and Eli is a vampire. It is Håkan's job to bring Eli fresh blood, which he gets by killing other humans. First he anesthetizes them with halothane, then he strings them up by the feet, slits their necks, and catches the blood in a jug, leaving the bodies to be discovered the next day. Unfortunately for Eli, Håkan is having problems securing blood for her. On his first kill after moving into the new apartment, he either lost or forgot the jug filled with blood. Consequently, Eli is beginning to get hungry.One evening, as Oskar is in the courtyard stabbing a tree in lieu of his tormentors, he notices Eli watching him. She's not very friendly, as she tells him right off that she can't be friends with him. The next evening, they run into each other again in the courtyard.

Movie title: Courage Under Fire Movie plot: While serving in the Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend Captain Boylar. The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, the crew of the Black Hawk claims that they heard firing from an M16, which Ilario and Monfriez deny. Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) to prevent another cover up. When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train.

The movie revolves around the investigation led by Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden should be the first woman to receive the posthumous Medal of Honor for her actions in the Gulf War. Serling is dealing with his own internal struggle after accidentally destroying a tank and killing his friend, Captain Boylar, during a confusing night battle. Throughout the investigation, Serling interviews members of Walden's crew who have different accounts of the events leading to Walden's death. These inconsistencies make it difficult for Serling to determine if Walden deserves the prestigious Medal of Honor. Specialist Andrew Ilario (Matt Damon) praises Walden for her courage and leadership, while Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that she was a coward and that he led the crew in combat. Monfriez eventually commits suicide after Serling confronts him about inconsistencies in his story. When Serling finds and interviews Ilario again, he learns the true story of what happened on that fateful day. Monfriez had wanted to leave Warrant Officer One Rady behind and flee the battle scene, but Walden refused to abandon her crew member. Their disagreement led to an altercation, and Monfriez accidentally shot and killed Walden. The fire Altameyer mentioned was caused when the fuel bladder was dropped onto the T-54 tank and ignited with a flare gun, as described by Monfriez. In the end, Serling's investigation reveals that Captain Karen Emma Walden demonstrated exceptional courage and leadership under difficult circumstances. She put her life on the line to save her crew and exemplified the qualities deserving of the Medal of Honor.

The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and guitar), the Edge (guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's sound grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music, yet has maintained an anthemic sound. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns. - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. - Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - Paul David Hewson (born 10 May 1960), known by his stage name Bono, is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, venture capitalist, businessman, and philanthropist. He is best known as the lead vocalist of rock band U2. Bono was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, and attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School where he met his future wife, Alison Stewart, and the future members of U2. Bono writes almost all U2 lyrics, frequently using religious, social, and political themes. During U2's early years, his lyrics contributed to their rebellious and spiritual tone. As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members. - Jubilee 2000 was an international coalition movement in over 40 countries that called for cancellation of third world debt by the year 2000. This movement coincided with the Great Jubilee, the celebration of the year 2000 in the Catholic Church. From early 2001, Jubilee 2000 split into an array of organisations around the world. - In computer science and information theory, data differencing or differential compression is producing a technical description of the difference between two sets of data a source and a target. Formally, a data differencing algorithm takes as input source data and target data, and produces difference data such that given the source data and the difference data, one can reconstruct the target data (\\"patching\\" the source with the difference to produce the target). - Delta encoding is a way of storing or transmitting data in the form of differences ( deltas ) between sequential data rather than complete files ; more generally this is known as data differencing . Delta encoding is sometimes called delta compression , particularly where archival histories of changes are required ( e.g. , in revision control software ) . The differences are recorded in discrete files called \`\` deltas '' or \`\` diffs '' . In situations where differences are small -- for example , the change of a few words in a large document or the change of a few records in a large table -- delta encoding greatly reduces data redundancy . Collections of unique deltas are substantially more space - efficient than their non-encoded equivalents . From a logical point of view the difference between two data values is the information required to obtain one value from the other -- see relative entropy . The difference between identical values ( under some equivalence ) is often called 0 or the neutral element . What object entity has the relation of 'use' with the subject 'delta encoding'?

Possible A: work in life, speak to people, everywhere, sitting ideal, care for people Why is \\"work in life\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Work in life\\" aligns with human common sense because it communicates the notion that in order to earn money or a living, people generally need to engage in some form of productive activity, commonly referred to as work. This doesn't necessarily mean only traditional employment but can also include entrepreneurship, freelance work, or other creative or innovative ways to add value to society in exchange for monetary return. From a religious perspective, many belief systems uphold the value of work and the concept of earthly responsibilities. Many religions emphasize the significance of labor and its role in maintaining societal balance and personal dignity. The Bible, for instance, includes passages that encourage followers to work diligently and honestly. However, it's important to note the interpretation of what 'God wants people to do for money' would greatly vary based on individual's religious beliefs, spiritual understandings, personal values, and socio-cultural perspectives.

For nearly 2000 years, Sanskrit was the language of a cultural order that exerted influence across South Asia, Inner Asia, Southeast Asia, and to a certain extent East Asia. A significant form of post-Vedic Sanskrit is found in the Sanskrit of Indian epic poetry—the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The deviations from Pāṇini in the epics are generally considered to be on account of interference from Prakrits, or innovations, and not because they are pre-Paninian. Traditional Sanskrit scholars call such deviations ārṣa (आर्ष), meaning 'of the ṛṣis', the traditional title for the ancient authors. In some contexts, there are also more \\"prakritisms\\" (borrowings from common speech) than in Classical Sanskrit proper. Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit is a literary language heavily influenced by the Middle Indo-Aryan languages, based on early Buddhist Prakrit texts which subsequently assimilated to the Classical Sanskrit standard in varying degrees. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did Classic Sanskrit assimilate to?","completion":"Classic Sanskrit is like a very old way of talking that was used by many people in a big place called South Asia a very, very long time ago. People who wrote special stories, like the Ramayana and Mahabharata, sometimes changed the way they talked a little, so it sounded different. This happened because they used words and ways of talking from other people around them or made new words. Classic Sanskrit mixed with these new words and ways of talking and became a new kind of Sanskrit. So, to answer your question: Classic Sanskrit assimilated or mixed with words and speech from the people around them, like from other languages called Prakrits and Middle Indo-Aryan languages, which were also used by some people a long, long time ago."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: U.S.-China Meeting Renews the Dialogue For many years, U.S. officials traveled to Beijing and lectured the Chinese about the value of their currency and the need for economic and political reforms. On Monday, about 200 senior Chinese officials traveled to Washington and heard soothing words of reassurance from U.S. officials: The dollar is still sound, your investments are safe and we are working really hard to restructure our economy. Such is the nature of the U.S.-China relationship today. Behind all the reassuring language is a nervous sense that the fate of the world economy is increasingly dependent on the United States and China working together. President Obama opened the first meeting of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue on Monday by declaring that the two countries share a responsibility for the 21st century, and should strive to cooperate not only on economic matters but also on key issues such as climate change, nuclear proliferation and transnational threats. \\"The pursuit of power among nations must no longer be seen as a zero-sum game,\\" he said at the start of the two-day meeting, held at the Ronald Reagan Building and co-chaired by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. \\"Progress -- including security -- must be shared.\\" The meetings are intended mostly to allow officials to exchange views on a wide range of issues and to establish contacts in each other's governments. On Monday, Obama gave a gentle prod to China on its human rights record, noting that \\"all people should be free to speak their minds,\\" but otherwise focused on forming with China a partnership \\"of opportunity.\\" The talks are a broader version of the dialogue that was started in 2005 by Robert B. Zoellick, deputy secretary of state under President George W. Bush, and later led, with a more economic tilt, by Henry M. Paulson Jr., Treasury secretary under Bush. This time around, Clinton, who during the presidential primary campaign declared that the U.S. relationship with China would be the \\"most bilateral relationship in the world in this century,\\" has sought a prominent role for foreign policy issues. The cast of participants has been broadened; Monday's talks includes Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, National Economic Council Director Lawrence H. Summers and Peter Orszag, Obama's budget director, as well as other Cabinet members. The Chinese side is led by State Councilor Dai Bingguo, who oversees foreign policy, and Vice Premier Wang Qishan, who oversees economic policy. Dai, speaking in the morning, noted that the two countries are separated by huge differences in culture, ideology and social systems, but added that the economic crisis demonstrated \\"we are actually all in the same big boat that has been hit by fierce wind and huge waves.\\" \\"The United States will never become China, and China will never become the United States,\\" he added. \\"But the living fact is that China and the United States' interactions have never been so frequent, our interest has never been interwoven so closely, and the mutually beneficial cooperation between our two countries has never been so broad, and the driving force boosting the China-U.S. relationship has never been so strong.\\" As China's economy has boomed, so has its international clout. With the revenue generated by huge trade surpluses with the United States -- and policies that keep its currency artificially low -- Beijing is the largest single investor in U.S. Treasury bonds. That 1.5 trillion stake means that China has been critical to Obama's efforts to boost the U.S. economy through deficit spending, although Chinese officials have expressed worry that the value of their holdings will fall if the U.S. deficit is not brought under control. \\"China has a huge amount of investment in the U.S., mainly in the form of Treasury bonds,\\" Assistant Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said in a press briefing with reporters. \\"We are concerned about the security of our financial assets.\\" He added that China favors a \\"stable\\" dollar, which has fallen in value this year against major currencies. Geithner, addressing the meeting, stressed that the administration is \\"committed to taking the necessary measures to bring our fiscal deficits down to a more sustainable level once recovery is firmly established.\\" He also praised Chinese leaders for their efforts to boost domestic consumption, which he said \\"will be a huge contribution to our global challenge in bringing about a more rapid but more balanced and sustainable global recovery.\\" Both sides acknowledged that they must tread carefully in the coming months, with U.S. officials warning Beijing not to expect that American demand will once again spur China's growth. \\"There was a lot of discussion about how both sides are grappling with the timing of the withdrawal of their macroeconomic stimulus,\\" said David Loevinger, the Treasury's senior coordinator for China affairs, told reporters. \\"There was general agreement that it was very important that this doesn't occur too soon because the recoveries are still very fragile, but also an acknowledgment that they have to take place at the right time, and not let another set of imbalances and bubbles build up in the economy.\\" Summary:","completion":"The first meeting of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue took place on 2009, highlighting the increasingly important relationship between the United States and China in terms of the global economy. President Obama emphasized the shared responsibilities of both countries within the 21st century, encouraging cooperation on economic matters as well as climate change, nuclear proliferation, and transnational threats. The talks aimed to exchange views on various issues and establish contacts within each other's governments.

Article: Over the last 70 years, researchers have been studying happy and unhappy people and finally found out ten factors that make a difference. Our feelings of well-being at any moment are determined to a certain degree by genes. However, of all the factors, wealth and age are the top two. Money can buy a degree of happiness. But once you can afford to feed, clothe and house yourself , each extra dollar makes less and less difference. Researchers find that, on average, wealthier people are happier. But the link between money and happiness is complex. In the past half-century, average income has sharply increased in developed countries, yet happiness levels have remained almost the same. Once your basic needs are met, money only seems to increase happiness if you have more than your friends, neighbors and colleagues. \\"Dollars buy status, and status makes people feel better,\\" conclude some experts, which helps explain why people who can seek status in other ways---scientists or actors, for example--may happily accept relatively poorly-paid jobs. In a research, Professor Alex Michalos found that the people whose desires--not just for money, but for friends, family, job, health--rose furthest beyond what they already had, tended to be less happy than those who felt a smaller gap. Indeed, the size of the gap predicted happiness about five times better than income alone. \\"The gap measures just blow away the only measures of income.\\" Says Michalos. Another factor that has to do with happiness is age. Old age may not be so bad. \\"Given all the problems of aging, how could the elderly be more satisfied?\\" asks Professor Laura Carstensen. In one survey, Carstensen interviewed 184 people between the ages of 18 and 94, and asked them to fill out an emotions questionnaire. She found that old people reported positive emotions just as often as young people, but negative emotions much less often. Why are old people happier? Some scientists suggest older people may expect life to be harder and learn to live with it, or they're more... Question: According to the passage, the feeling of happiness _ .

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that began composing Little Galop? Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Lee County Sheriffs Office Sgt. Anita Iriarte of the Lee County Sheriff's Office in Florida told ABC News the footage from the Smokin' Oyster Brewery showed suspect Lois Riess, 56, wearing a light-blue shirt and with white-gray hair, talking to Pamela Hutchinson. Hutchinson, 59, was found fatally shot at her motel April 9, according to the Lee County Sheriff's Office. Her cash, credit cards, identification and white Acura had been stolen, police said. Police said the video was taken on April 5, 2018, at 5:40 p.m. in Fort Myers. Police also said surveillance images appeared to show Riess leaving the motel. Lee County Sheriffs Office \\"Our suspect is absolutely armed and dangerous. ... She may look like anyone's grandmother or mother but behind that smile is a cold-blooded murderer,\\" Lee County Undersheriff Carmine Marceno told ABC affiliate WZVN-TV. KAAL This weekend, authorities kicked off a cross-country manhunt for Riess of Blooming Prairie, Minnesota, whom they suspect of also shooting her husband, David, dead at their Minnesota home March 23 and then taking off in their car. Marceno said Riess \\"loves casinos\\" and has a \\"gambling problem.\\" Police said that after she allegedly killed her husband, Riess made a stop at an Iowa casino. Then the trail went cold for two weeks. She then made her way to Fort Myers, Florida, where, police said, she befriended Hutchinson. Hutchinson looked like Riess, police said, and they allege Riess' mode of operation was to befriend women before stealing their identity. Police in Fort Myers Beach, Florida, identified Riess as a suspect in Hutchinson's death. Lee County Sheriffs Office Police said Riess allegedly drove Hutchinson's car to Corpus Christi, Texas, where it was last spotted. Marceno said she may be in Mexico. \\"Our main fear is once her resources, once she diminishes all her resources, that she will be desperate and she will commit another act of violence,\\" he said. \\"We don't want any more acts of violence or God forbid murder. ... She's on the run and we need to do everything we can to bring her to justice.\\" Riess has three adult children and is a grandmother as well, according to Dodge County Sheriff Scott Rose. She has no criminal record, according to authorities. She is now wanted for murder, grand theft auto and identity theft. ABC News' Amanda Maile contributed to this report. ||||| Video (00:07) : Lois Riess, 56, is shown patronizing the Smokin' Oyster Brewery in Fort Myers about 5:40 p.m. on April 5, just days before sheriff's deputies believe she killed and stole the identity of a woman who has a similar appearance. The snippet of surveillance video is only seven seconds long. Yet in that brief span, it captures a \\"coldblooded killer\\" wooing a new friend who had only a short time to live. Taken at a happy hour on April 5 at the Smokin' Oyster Brewery in Fort Myers, Fla., the video shows Lois Riess, of Blooming Prairie, Minn., talking to a woman police later identified as 59-year-old Pamela Hutchinson. Riess appears charming and animated, tossing her silver hair as she leans in and smiles and chats with her bar mate. Four days later, Hutchinson would be found shot to death in her rented condo in Fort Myers Beach. Authorities believe Riess, who fled Minnesota in late March after allegedly shooting and killing her husband, David, targeted Hutchinson because the two women looked alike, then stole her identity after killing her. \\"The suspect Riess … is on the loose and running,\\" Lee County Undersheriff Carmine Marceno said Monday night. \\"We have a huge hunt with the U.S. marshals.\\" Riess, Marceno added, \\"could look like anybody's mother or grandmother. She smiles, yet she is a coldblooded killer. She's killed two people and she's still on the run.\\" As the hunt for Riess entered its fourth week Monday, new information about her past surfaced in court records in Minnesota that showed she had been accused of taking more than 78,000 from her disabled sister and spending it on herself, including thousands of dollars at casinos. Recent photos of Lois Riess, 56, of Blooming Prairie, Minn. Believed to be in Texas, she is now in the deaths of her husband and a Florida woman. According to the records: Riess was appointed in 2012 as guardian and conservator for her older sister, Kimberly Sanchez, now 62. Legal documents said that Sanchez suffers from bipolar disorder and clinical depression, as well as Parkinson's disease, and has the cognitive level of a 10-year-old. A routine annual audit in 2015 found supposed payments, gifts and loans from Sanchez's accounts that had no documentation to support the transactions. One payment of 14,000 supposedly was made to William Witte, the sisters' father — but he was dead. Other payments totaling 15,000 were made to other relatives of Riess, again without supporting documentation. Riess also paid more than 40,000 to herself from her sister's assets, court records show. In September 2015, Minnesota Prairie County Alliance, a nonprofit service organization, sought to have Riess terminated as her sister's guardian and conservator. \\"I received a report that Lois Riess transfers funds from the guardianship account for Kimberly Sanchez to Lois Riess' own account,\\" an affidavit said. \\"Lois Riess then withdraws the funds at the local casino.\\" In February 2016, Riess was removed as her sister's guardian and conservator. She did not contest her removal. That same month, the newly appointed guardian and conservator asked the court to order Riess to repay more than 78,000 to her sister's account. There is no record that Riess was ever ordered to repay the money or that she was charged with a crime in the case. Officials of the new guardian and conservator, Alternative Resolutions Inc., declined to comment Monday. Florida authorities said late last week that they believed Riess most recently was in the Corpus Christi area in Texas, possibly driving a car she stole from Hutchinson, whose body was found April 9. Marceno said Hutchinson's white 2005 Acura TL with Florida license plate Y37TAA had been spotted in Louisiana and around Corpus Christi in the days after Hutchinson's body was found. In recent days, however, the search for Riess has gone cold. Marceno said Monday that she will eventually run out of resources and fears that, in desperation, she could kill again. Riess is considered to be armed and dangerous, he said. Hutchinson's relatives, meanwhile, said it is no surprise that Hutchinson, who was \\"outgoing\\" and \\"welcoming,\\" would have struck up a conversation with a total stranger like Riess. \\"She was very kind and sweet, everybody was a friend of hers,\\" said Daniele Watts Jeffreys, a cousin from Richmond, Va. Hutchinson, of Bradenton, Fla., was a former used-car salesperson in Virginia before she relocated to Florida. \\"You'd want to buy from her because she'd never cheat you,\\" Jeffreys said. Hutchinson was divorced and didn't have many immediate family members. Her mother, who \\"was the world to her,\\" died in 2013, Jeffreys said. After that, Hutchinson was constantly reaching out to other relatives to stay in touch and check in whether by phone, text message or social media, Jeffreys said. Last Monday, after relatives were unable to reach her, authorities found Hutchinson's body inside the condo she rented in Fort Myers Beach, where she had gone to scatter ashes of another relative. She had been shot in the heart, Jeffreys said. \\"It was just evil,\\" Jeffreys said. In this video image, Lois Riess, right, talked to Pamela Hutchinson. Days later, Hutchinson was shot dead. Riess is suspected of killing her husband in late March at their home outside Blooming Prairie, a town of about 2,000 people 85 miles south of the Twin Cities. Police say the same gun was used in both slayings. Authorities also have said they suspect that after David Riess was killed, his wife transferred nearly 10,000 from his business account into his personal account and then forged his signature on three checks to herself for 11,000. She then fled the state, stopping at an Iowa casino on her way to Florida. Authorities were tipped off, but arrived too late to catch her. Riess' whereabouts remained a mystery until last week, when she became a suspect in Hutchinson's murder after authorities in Florida found a white 2005 Cadillac Escalade that Riess was believed to have been driving after her husband's death. Investigators said that after Riess befriended and killed Hutchinson, she stole her credit cards, cash and car. Photos showed Riess at Hutchinson's condo. Late last week, Florida authorities filed murder, grand theft of a motor vehicle and grand theft and criminal use of personal identification charges against Riess. She also faces second-degree murder charges in Dodge County, Minnesota, where her husband's body was found March 23. \\"I hope we bring this to closure soon,\\" Marceno said Monday. \\"As quick and as safe as possible.\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"Florida authorities have released surveillance footage of Lois Riess, a 56-year-old Minnesota grandmother, who is suspected of killing two people, including her husband.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

The answer is:","completion":"While the information provided about UCSB's rankings in 2012 is interesting and relevant, it does not directly answer the question regarding the number of students who attend the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Instead, you might provide an answer that addresses the enrollment figures for the university. As of Fall 2020, the University of California, Santa Barbara had a total enrollment of approximately 26,314 students, with 23,070 being undergraduate students, and 3,244 being graduate students. These figures can be further broken down to show that 12,344 of these undergraduates are male, 10,726 are female, and 637 are nonbinary. Moreover, among graduate students, 1,781 are male, 1,435 are female, and 28 are nonbinary. UCSB is a large and diverse university, offering a wide range of academic programs across its three Colleges: College of Letters and Science, College of Engineering, and College of Creative Studies. The student body is made up of students from various backgrounds, including those from international locations. The university is recognized for its strong research focus, interdisciplinary approach, and commitment to providing a high-quality education. It should be noted that the rankings provided in the original information might be outdated, as they were from 2012. According to the U.S. News & World Report for 2022, UCSB is ranked 30th among National Universities and 6th among public universities. This highlights that the university has been successful in making strides in its academic and research pursuits over the past decade. In conclusion, when answering a question regarding the number of students at UCSB, it is more appropriate to address the enrollment figures for the university rather than including information about rankings. Providing context on the diverse student body and academic programs can further enhance the answer, as well as mentioning any recent or relevant rankings for a more accurate representation of the university's current standing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The disappearance of the shoes that former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez was allegedly wearing when he murdered Odin Lloyd has raised many questions. It is suspected that these shoes, among other evidence, could potentially have been crucial in proving Hernandez's guilt. However, the shoes have mysteriously vanished, leaving investigators puzzled. The shoes in question were four pairs of white, size-13 Nike sneakers found by investigators in Hernandez's North Attleboro, Massachusetts mansion on June 18, 2013. The discovery took place just a day after Odin Lloyd was found with six gunshot wounds on wasteland just a mile away from the scene. Despite seizing these sneakers, investigators were ultimately unable to locate the specific shoes that Hernandez allegedly wore during the murder. Upon further investigation, police later returned to Hernandez's home on June 22 to conduct another search. During this search, they discovered and photographed three additional pairs of shoes in the basement's \\"man cave.\\" However, these shoes were not taken into evidence, as they did not match the type believed to have been worn by Hernandez during the murder. Following a conversation with Hernandez's acquaintance, a man by the name of Paradis, it was revealed that after Hernandez had left the condominium, he called back to ask Paradis whether he had left \\"it\\" in his bedroom. However, it is still unclear what \\"it\\" referred to, and whether or not it was directly related to the missing shoes. The mysterious disappearance of the shoes that Hernandez allegedly wore during the murder of Odin Lloyd is a significant development in the case. The shoes, along with other pieces of potential evidence, could have played a crucial role in determining Hernandez's guilt. As the case stands, without these shoes and with limited evidence to conclusively tie Hernandez to the murder, it remains a mystery as to what exactly occurred on the night of Odin Lloyd's death. Investigators continue to search for any leads or information that could help them locate the missing shoes and, in turn, provide them with the evidence necessary to piece together the events of the night in question. With the shoes still missing, the extent of Hernandez's involvement and the details surrounding the murder remain unclear, leaving a tragic and puzzling mystery with no definitive answers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yahoo's decision to curtail remote working among its employees has stirred dismay in the technology industry at a time when many companies are innovating new solutions to enable telecommuting. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, one of the planet's biggest showcases of new digital technology, numerous manufacturers are touting gadgets and software specifically aimed at keeping workers out of the office and either on the road or at home. Yet among those exhibiting at the annual event, there was mixed reaction as some digital innovators aired reservations about Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's latest attempt to revive the search engine's flagging fortunes while others backed a more balanced approach. Tell us: What smartphone feature would you like to see in the future? Mayer's strategy was revealed after a leaked memo set a June deadline for remote workers to either relocate within physical commuting reach of a Yahoo office or leave the company. Yahoo has declined to comment but the memo, obtained by tech blog All Things D, said the move was necessary as \\"to become the absolute best place to work, communication and collaboration will be important, so we need to be working side-by-side.\\" The announcement comes as many governments worldwide are urging employers to consider telecommuting as way of alleviating overburdened and environmentally detrimental transport systems and also striking better work/life balances. Advances in technology, particularly the spread of broadband internet connections and 3G and 4G mobile phone networks has made this possible. At the Mobile World Congress event, many exhibitors stake their futures on an increase in telecommuting. Greg Sullivan, Senior Product Manager for Windows Phone, said remote working provided a tremendous opportunity for workers to get more out of their lives while reducing their impact on the planet's ecosystem. \\"We have to be vigilant in making sure that technology doesn't let work overtake us. But one of things that's been enabled by this, is the ability to have it all,\\" he told CNN, illustrating his point with an anecdote about being called by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. \\"I was at my daughter's soccer game not long ago and I was waiting for a very important e-mail from a very important person at Microsoft -- named Steve -- and I didn't have to stay home and wait for it. \\"I could go to my daughter's soccer game and see on my phone that the e-mail came in. So it was a win-win situation and that's what technology can do for us. \\"Balmer was probably fine with that - he probably didn't even know that I was at my daughter's soccer game.\\" One MWC exhibitor GENBAND, a U.S.-based company that provides technology which can be used to create remote working environments, said Yahoo's move was understandable, but the problems it faces could be overcome with better technology. \\"There is some validity to the arguments motivating Yahoo's move away from supporting remote workers,\\" said GENBAND Chief Executive Charlie Vogt. \\"Worker productivity is in some ways a measure of meaningful human interaction and face-to-face communications.\\" But, he said, communication systems, including video conferencing and internet collaboration, that allow employees to realistically simulate face-to-face interaction, are already on the market. \\"With little effort most remote employees can take advantage of intelligent communications tools to elegantly blend the benefits of being part of a vibrant office environment and having the flexibility that comes from working outside the office on a permanent or part-time basis.\\" Cisco, another MWC exhibitor whose products are directly aimed at creating remote working environments, insisted its technology was capable of recreating every aspect of real-life interaction short of physical contact. Marc Musgrove, Cisco's global communications director, said Yahoo's announcement was unfortunately timed as it came just days ahead of the March 4 start of the third annual Telework Week, a Cisco-backed global initiative to encourage remote working. Musgrove said Cisco's video-link products allowed employees to talk lag-free in high definition, but he said there was a need to strike a balance between \\"appropriate\\" home working and office-based interaction in genuinely collaborative work spaces such as Cisco's main campus in San Jose, California. \\"When people come into the office you don't want people just sitting there heads down knocking out their emails, because they can do that from a café or a home office or remote office.\\" Foursquare Co-Founder Dennis Crowley also emphasized the need for balance: \\"It is great to offer employees the flexibility that If they need to be off for a day or so, or for an afternoon, that's totally fine. \\"We try to get as many people together in the office as possible because that's where stuff gets done. People hang out in the lunch room, and they hang out in the hallways and in different meeting rooms. You are more productive when people are all together, but I think you need to have a little bit of flexibility. \\"We use things like Google+ Hangouts to do a lot of video conferencing at Foursquare, so we're able to make it work. \\"It's a mixture of both, but not too much out of the office,\\" he added. David Marcus, President of PayPal, said: \\"This is not a black and white answer. Generally if teams are together they're definitely more efficient and more productive. But that being said, you also need to cater to moms who need to go and pick up their kids from school. And so you need to find the right balance.\\" Write highlights for this article.","completion":"Smartphone features for the future could include better capabilities for remote working, as many companies innovate new solutions to enable telecommuting.

Article: For children under one year of age, don't give them anything but formula or breast milk in their bottles. Juice and milk are too sugary, and water can lead to malnutrition. When babies fall asleep with bottles, they often keep the nipple in their mouths, allowing milk or juice to drip into their mouths and pool around the teeth and gums. The sugar in the drinks gives incentive for bacteria to stay on teeth, causing decay. It's best not to give any bottles at naps or bedtime, but if you must, then make sure to only put water in them. The exception to this rule is babies who haven't started eating solid foods yet. Babies who are still solely on breast milk, formula, or a combination of both do not need extra water in their diet. In fact, feeding them extra water can lead to malnutrition or other problems. If your child is ambivalent about the bottle or does not insist on holding the bottle or drinking once she lays down, try brushing teeth before bed and simply skipping the bottle. It also helps to offer milk at dinnertime. If just giving water doesn't work, you can try removing the bottle once your child falls asleep. That removes the liquid that could cause damage to her teeth. Most doctors prefer that you don't let your child fall asleep with a bottle at all; it can make it harder for your child to be weaned from the bottle. Offer a pacifier instead of a bottle if your baby wants something to suck. Don't forget to gently wipe her mouth out after you remove the bottle. Coating the nipple of the pacifier with any type of sugary substance (including juice and milk, which contain natural sugars) can trap sugar in the front of your child's mouth. This practice allows bacteria to gather and can cause tooth decay. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary for this would be: For babies under one year old, only give them formula or breast milk in their bottles. Don't give juice, milk, or water because they can cause problems like tooth decay or malnutrition. It's best not to let babies sleep with bottles, but if you must, only give them water.

Beleaguered Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, sitting alongside Iran's intelligence chief, proclaimed Tuesday \\"the determination of the people and government of Syria to cleanse the country of terrorists.\\" His Iranian visitor, Saeed Jalili, responded, \\"What is happening in Syria is not an internal issue but a conflict between the axis of resistance on one hand and regional and global enemies of this axis on the other.\\" Jalili's comment was made public by the Syrian news agency that al-Assad's government runs. It's a familiar theme for the Iranians, who have cast events in Syria as part of a much broader ideological battle. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has similarly characterized events in Syria as a \\"war between the front of hegemony and the front of resistance.\\" And it is likely to be a OPTIONS: - Al-Assad where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - Ali Khamenei where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - Bashar al-Assad where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - CNN where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - Hezbollah where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - Iran where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - Iranian where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - Iranians where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - Israel where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - Jalili where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - Saeed Jalili where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - Syria where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - Syrian where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures. - al-Assad where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures.","completion":"Given the context of the story, it would be most appropriate to conclude it with the option \\"Syria where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures\\". This is because the entire narrative is focused on the events happening in Syria and how these events relate to its leadership and relations with Iran. Thus, emphasizing the weakening control in Syria is the most accurate and relevant conclusion to draw from the descriptions and themes presented throughout the story. This ending emphasizes the turbulence and challenges Syria is undergoing, which is consistent with the tone and content of the rest of the text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From 2000 to 2012, consumption of cigars more than doubled in the United States, from slightly over 6.1 billion in 2000 to more than 13.7 billion in 2012. Cigar use is most common among young people. In the 2012 National Youth Tobacco Survey data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 12.6% of high school students had smoked at least one cigar in the past 30 days. After cigarettes, cigars were the second most commonly used tobacco product in youths and the most commonly used tobacco product among African American high school students. From the CDC’s national Adult Tobacco Survey for 2009-2015, data suggest that prevalence among adults was highest among 18-24 years (15.9%) followed by 25-44 years old (7.2%). From the same survey, prevalence among men (10.4%) was significantly higher than women (3.1%) and likewise among LGBT (12.2%) and heterosexual (6.5%) respondents.

The second question asks about the pricing or costs for database services, specifically with regards to Teradata, IBM, and Oracle. Step 2: Compare the questions These two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they address different topics. The first question is about the technical differences between Teradata and Oracle, while the second question is about the business model and pricing of database services from Teradata, IBM, and Oracle. Now, let me answer each question: 1. Differences between Teradata and Oracle: Teradata is designed for large-scale data warehousing and analytics, while Oracle is a general-purpose relational database management system. Teradata has a massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture, which enables it to handle large volumes of data and complex queries more efficiently. Oracle operates using a shared-everything architecture, which may not scale as efficiently for data warehousing and large-scale analytics. In general, Teradata is better suited for organizations that deal with very large amounts of data and need advanced analytical capabilities. 2. Costing for database companies: Database companies like Teradata, IBM, and Oracle usually charge customers based on factors such as software licenses, hardware costs, ongoing maintenance, and support services. They may offer varying pricing models, including: - Perpetual licenses: Customers pay a one-time fee for the software and can use it indefinitely. Annual maintenance costs are typically 15-25% of the original license cost. - Subscription licenses: Customers pay a periodic fee (monthly or yearly) for the software, and the cost includes maintenance and support services. - Usage-based pricing: Customers pay based on the volume of data processed, the number of queries executed, or other usage metrics. - Cloud-based services: In the case of cloud-based database offerings, customers pay based on the resources they use, such as storage, compute power, and data transfer. The exact pricing and cost structures vary depending on the specific vendor, product, and terms of the agreement. It's essential to compare the total cost of ownership, including upfront costs, and ongoing maintenance and support, when considering different database solutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The translation must respect the syntactical structure of the French language, correctly using articles, prepositions, and tense. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the translation: 1. The English phrase \\"Based on physical inspection and interviews\\" could be translated to French as \\"Sur la base de l'inspection physique et des entretiens\\". This was done by individually translating \\"based on\\" to \\"Sur la base de\\", \\"physical inspection\\" to \\"l'inspection physique\\", \\"and\\" to \\"et\\", \\"interviews\\" to \\"des entretiens\\". 2. Next part of the sentence \\"these standards have been met\\" can be translated to \\"ces normes ont été respectées\\". Here \\"these standards\\" translates to \\"ces normes\\", \\"have been\\" translates to \\"ont été\\" and \\"met\\" translates to \\"respectées\\". 3. Finally, the phrase \\"in the POS\\" would translate to \\"dans le POS\\". \\"in the\\" is translated to \\"dans le\\" and \\"POS\\" remains \\"POS\\" as it's an acronym for Point of Sale and commonly used in the French language as well.

The equation is: 0 = 24*a - 49*a + 43*a - 90 We'll follow these steps to simplify and solve the equation. Step 1: Combine like terms. The like terms in the equation are all of the terms involving the variable a. We have three terms with a: 24a, -49a, and +43a. 24a - 49a + 43a = (-25a) + 43a This simplifies to: 18a - 90 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable, a. To isolate a, we need to move the constant term (-90) to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 90 to both sides: 18a - 90 + 90 = 0 + 90 This simplifies to: 18a = 90 Step 3: Solve for a. Now we want to get a by itself.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground. Question: What are the two men on watch with Roland talking about?

Dunne played in Dublin with Stella Maris before playing in England for Everton . She played with Stella Maris in Dublin before playing for Everton in England .","completion":"Although both sentences provide the same core information, they have slight variations in their structures and focus. Below is a detailed comparison between the two sentences. Sentence 1: Dunne played in Dublin with Stella Maris before playing in England for Everton. Sentence 2: She played with Stella Maris in Dublin before playing for Everton in England. First, let's look at the commonalities: 1. The subject: Both sentences talk about \\"Dunne\\" (referred to as \\"she\\" in the second sentence) and her experiences playing football. 2. The sequence of events: Both sentences convey that Dunne played for Stella Maris in Dublin first, then moved to play for Everton in England. Now let's analyze the differences: 1. The starting point: The first sentence starts with the name \\"Dunne,\\" while the second sentence starts with the pronoun \\"She.\\" The second sentence assumes that the reader already knows about Dunne based on the prior context. 2. Overall structure: Sentence 1 uses the structure \\"played in _ with _ before playing in _ for _,\\" while Sentence 2 uses the structure \\"played with _ in _ before playing for _ in _.\\" This subtle structural change somewhat shifts the emphasis from the locations (Dublin and England) in Sentence 1 to the teams (Stella Maris and Everton) in Sentence 2. In summary, while both sentences essentially convey the same message, there are minor differences in how they present the information. The first sentence puts more emphasis on the locations where she played (Dublin and England), whereas the second sentence focuses more on her playing for different teams (Stella Maris and Everton)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: In what aspects is Hillary Clinton better than Trump? Second question: Is Hillary Clinton really worse than Donald Trump? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"To address both questions, I will perform a comparison between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump based on various aspects such as political experience, policy proposals, and public opinion. Steps: 1. Research their political experience: I will gather information about their political careers to determine their experience in governance and politics. - Hillary Clinton: Before serving as Secretary of State under President Obama, she was a New York senator for eight years. In contrast, Trump, a former businessman and reality TV star, had no political experience before becoming president. 2. Analyze their policy proposals: I will summarize their policy stances on significant issues such as healthcare, the economy, and international relations. - Healthcare: Clinton supported expanding the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), while Trump strived to repeal and replace it. - Economy: Clinton prioritized investing in infrastructure and clean energy, whereas Trump focused on deregulation and tax cuts for businesses and individuals. - International relations: Clinton advocated for diplomacy and stronger global alliances, while Trump took a more protectionist and nationalist stance. 3. Examine public opinion: I will research surveys about how the public views these two figures. - Public opinion varies widely, with Clinton generally favored by Democrats and Trump by Republicans. Views on who is better or worse depend on personal preferences as well as their political party affiliation. Conclusion: The two questions are not exactly the same: the first question asks about specific aspects in which Hillary Clinton may be considered better than Trump, while the second question focuses on determining if Hillary Clinton is worse than Trump overall. It's essential to recognize that the assessment depends on an individual's priorities, values, and political alignment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The camp now found itself on a small triangular raft of ice; a break-up of this would mean disaster, so Shackleton readied the lifeboats for the party's enforced departure. He had now decided they would try, if possible, to reach the distant Deception Island because a small wooden church had been reportedly erected for the benefit of whalers. This could provide a source of timber that might enable them to construct a seaworthy boat.At 1 p.m. on 9 April, the Dudley Docker was launched, and an hour later all three boats were away. Shackleton himself commanded the James Caird, Worsley the Dudley Docker, and navigating officer Hubert Hudson was nominally in charge of the Stancomb Wills, though because of his precarious mental state the effective commander was Tom Crean.The boats were surrounded by ice, dependent upon leads of water opening up, and progress was perilous and erratic. Frequently the boats were tied to floes, or dragged up onto them, while the men camped and waited for conditions to improve. Shackleton was wavering again between several potential destinations, and on 12 April, rejected the various island options and decided on Hope Bay, at the very tip of Graham Land. However, conditions in the boats, in temperatures sometimes as low as −20 °F (−29 °C), with little food and regular soakings in icy seawater, were wearing the men down, physically and mentally. Shackleton therefore decided that Elephant Island, the nearest of the possible refuges, was now the most practical option.On 14 April, the boats lay off the south-east coast of Elephant Island, but could not land as the shore consisted of perpendicular cliffs and glaciers. Next day the James Caird rounded the eastern point of the island, to reach the northern lee shore, and discovered a narrow shingle beach.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: Scientists use a quantity called __________ as a measure of disorder, or randomness. Choices: - chance level - motion - vector count - entropy A: The answer is:","completion":"entropy The answer to the question, \\"Scientists use a quantity called __________ as a measure of disorder, or randomness,\\" is entropy. Entropy is a fundamental concept in the field of thermodynamics and can also be related to information theory. In thermodynamics, entropy is used to quantify the amount of disorder or randomness in a system. It is generally associated with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that natural processes tend to increase the total entropy of an isolated system. In simpler terms, this law implies that energy tends to spread out and become more dispersed in a system, leading to increased disorder over time. The concept of entropy was first introduced by Rudolf Clausius in the mid-19th century as part of his development of the principles of classical thermodynamics. He described entropy as a quantity that could be related to the heat exchanged during a reversible process and how it affected the system's temperature. Entropy is often referred to as the \\"arrow of time\\" because it provides a direction for the natural progression of events. In a closed system, the entropy will either remain constant or increase as time moves forward. This general idea of events moving only in one direction, from order to disorder, is a fundamental aspect of the concept of entropy. In recent years, scientists have also connected entropy to information theory. In this context, entropy can be used to describe the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system that deals with information, such as a set of possible outcomes or a series of messages. Entropy in information theory is used to measure the average amount of information required to describe the behavior of a random variable or the average surprise associated with the outcome of a random variable. In conclusion, entropy is a quantity used by scientists as a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. It plays a crucial role in thermodynamics, where it describes the direction of natural processes and how they impact the energy distribution within a system. Moreover, entropy also finds significance in information theory, where it helps quantify the degree of uncertainty or information content inherent in a set of data."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
