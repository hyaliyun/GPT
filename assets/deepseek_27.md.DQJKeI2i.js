But tried-and-true punk rockers also aren't afraid to throw in a little color. And bright colors at that. Think neons -- blues, pinks, yellows, oranges, greens -- and silver and red. Punk is so not the same as being goth or emo, and this is one of the reasons why. Remember how we talked about how punk has gone through all these transitions? Pay 'em homage! Do your research -- there are often military themes, blue-collar themes (work boots and suspenders -- getting down to punk's roots), and British influences. So raid your English uncle's closet. He's bound to have something in there. Body piercings, glitter, rubber, vinyl, kilts, tattoos -- they all have a spot on the spectrum of punk. Bowler hats, studded wristbands, the anarchy symbol, shaved heads or long hair, punk has seen it all. Seriously.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that thought the fairies were cardboard cutouts? is inside the article: In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford.

Sister on a mission: the Texas nun using oil company money to fight fracking “I call it redeeming the money,” said Sister Elizabeth Riebschlaeger, munching a turkey sandwich in a bar with a stuffed steer’s head mounted on a wall next to a life-sized poster of John Wayne. About six years ago, when fracking got feverish in the Eagle Ford Shale, a company offered to lease the mineral rights to some land bought by her grandfather in the 1920s. Sister Elizabeth did some research about the consequences of fracking – extracting natural gas by pumping water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into wells deep underground – and did not like what she learned. But her attorney told her that the company would find a way to get the rights with or without her consent. She decided: “What I’ll do is I’ll take the money and use it for something that will promote responsible development.” The nun would donate her oil and gas windfall to fund watchdog activities, holding the oil and gas industry to account and warning of the dark effects of get-rich-quick, lightly regulated capitalism. The 80-year-old roams the region, educating, advocating and sniffing out malpractice, often in a white Honda Civic with more than 250,000 miles on the clock, a windscreen that keeps getting cracked by road debris kicked up by trucks, and bumper stickers that say “Don’t Mess With Texas” and “No Disposal Pits”. As a result of her vow of poverty, the proceeds from Sister Elizabeth’s mineral rights go to her Catholic congregation, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word of San Antonio, which funds her tours. Sister Elizabeth is backing a long-running, longshot campaign to stop a fracking waste pit from being built next year in fields just outside the city limits of Nordheim, only half a mile from the main drag and a school with about 170 pupils. It’s an eye-catching battle in the Eagle Ford, which runs for some 400 miles through south Texas from the border with Mexico through to counties north-west of Houston. “With the onset of the fracking we had hectic, frantic activity. Everybody was rushing to get those wells drilled,” Sister Elizabeth said. “Air quality and safety deteriorated a great deal. Lots of people were killed on the roads.” The first well of the Eagle Ford Shale boom was drilled in 2008. That year, 26 drilling permits were issued. In 2014, the height of the frenzy, the figure soared to 5,613. Amid the industry’s continuing downturn, 642 permits were issued from January to August this year. A landscape of cattle ranches became blotched with well pads. As vehicles barreled along once-quiet country roads, fatal traffic accidents in the region increased by 40% between 2011 and 2012. “One man’s American dream quickly becomes another man’s American nightmare,” Sister Elizabeth said. “All you have to do is drive around and you will see the damage being done to the environment. And I point those things out and tell people that it can be reported.” The rapacious pace of the fracking surge and the stress the process puts on the environment is hard for some to digest, even in a pragmatic and conservative state that owes much of its prosperity and population growth to oil. “We didn’t even water our lawns in droughts. Now we see it going out by the truckload so people can waste it by putting it down a hole,” said Lyn Janssen, whose bucolic ranch is a short drive along the same country lane as the planned dump. While other places nearby have grown and smartened up by exploiting the boom’s economic benefits, Nordheim has stayed sleepy. Folks whose families have been here for generations and want a quiet rural retirement like it that way. Which may help explain why, unlike its neighbours, little Nordheim, population 307, fought back. At the least there will be a substantial increase in industrial traffic. At worst, locals fear that the pit and landfill cells will stink and release toxic chemicals into the air and the ground. At 143 acres, the facility will be roughly half the size of the town. Federal rules allow a maximum leakage rate of 100 gallons per acre per day from disposal cells and 1,000 gallons per acre per day from pits. Then there are concerns about the potential for leaks and spills. An underground gas pipeline runs through the site. It ruptured in 2014 only a stone’s throw away and contaminated soil. “Within five years, if it’s put in, this town will die,” predicted Larry Baucum, seated behind the counter at Nordheim Mercantile, a bric-a-brac bazaar in town. In the window, next to a sign stating the opening hours – three days a week – there is a poster with a skull and crossbones and the slogan “Don’t Dump on Nordheim”. He believes that businesses and residents would flee. “It’s not that we’re against the pits – I’m an old oilfield hand,” the 69-year-old said. “But we’re against the location. It does not have to be right next to our city limits.” A posse of Nordheim residents banded together and formed a group called Concerned About Pollution (CAP). Armed with technical knowledge and a stubborn streak, they wrote letters, showed up at hearings in Austin and managed to stall the granting of a permit for three years. Their battle ultimately underlined the limited powers of the state’s oil and gas regulator, the anachronistically named Texas Railroad Commission, which has often drawn accusations that it enjoys an overly warm relationship with the industry it oversees. When the permit was confirmed in May, the developer, Petro Waste Environmental, said in a statement that “high standards of safety and compliance are Petro Waste’s top priority. These core company values played a vital role in the design and engineering process for this facility.” CAP did not admit defeat: it filed an ongoing lawsuit in Austin to challenge the decision. But victory appears unlikely. CAP’s president, Paul Baumann, was born in Nordheim and owns a rental property next to the site. His brother and nephew live close to the entrance. The 72-year-old returned after a career working at a DuPont chemical plant near Houston. “Thought I was gonna be away from chemicals and breathe my clean air down here,” he said ruefully before guiding his pickup truck down a bumpy path next to the future dump along a hayfield dense with dancing butterflies. “It’s a terrible site,” Sister Elizabeth said. But her indefatigable crusade against “capitalism without moral or ethical values” in the Eagle Ford Shale goes on.

Q: Underground criminal Divine lives under the pseudonym \\"Babs Johnson\\" with her mentally ill, egg-loving mother Edie, delinquent son Crackers, and traveling companion Cotton. They all live together in a pink and green trailer on the outskirts of Phoenix, Maryland, in front of which can be found a gazing ball alongside a pair of eponymous plastic pink flamingos. After learning that Divine has been named \\"the filthiest person alive\\" by a tabloid paper, jealous rivals Connie and Raymond Marble set out to destroy her career but come undone in the process.The Marbles run an \\"adoption clinic\\", which is actually a black market baby ring. They kidnap young women, have them impregnated by their manservant, Channing, and sell the babies to lesbian couples. (Channing is seen from behind, but apparently masturbates and ejaculates.) The proceeds are used to finance a network of dealers selling heroin in inner-city elementary schools. Raymond also gets money by exposing himself (with large kielbasa sausages tied to his penis) to unsuspecting women in a park and stealing their purses when they flee. The Marbles send a spy named Cookie in the guise of what Crackers thinks is a date. In one of the film's most infamous scenes, the two of them have sex while crushing a live chicken between them as Cotton looks on through a window. Cookie then informs the Marbles about Babs' real identity, her whereabouts, and her family, as well as information about her upcoming birthday party.The Marbles send a box of human feces to Divine as a birthday present with a card addressing her as \\"Fatso\\" and proclaiming themselves \\"The Filthiest People Alive\\". Worried her title has been seized, Divine proclaims whoever sent the package must die and her two associates agree. Meanwhile, at the Marbles', Channing dresses up as Connie and Raymond, wearing Connie's clothes and imitating their earlier overheard conversations. When the Marbles return home, they catch Channing in the act and respond with outrage, firing him and locking him in a closet until they can return from their tasks and kick him out for good.The birthday party begins as the Marbles arrive to spy on it. Divine receives an assortment of gifts, including lice shampoo, a pig's head, and an axe. Later on, they all witness a topless dancing woman with a snake and a contortionist who flexes his prolapsed anus in rhythm to the song \\"Surfin' Bird\\". One of the guests, the Egg Man, who delivers eggs to Edie daily, confesses his love for her and proposes marriage. She accepts his proposal and he carries Edie off in a wheelbarrow for a honeymoon around the egg industry. The Marbles, disgusted by the reveling, call the police, but this proves unsuccessful as Divine and the other party-goers kill the cops. Divine hacks up their bodies with the axe and the party-goers eat them.After the party ends, Divine and Crackers head to the Marbles' house, whose address they received from the local gossip Patty Hitler, where they lick and rub everything in their house to spread their \\"filthiness\\", which excites them to the point of engaging in oral sex. Divine and Crackers find Channing locked away, but they have no sympathy for him. Once they're in the basement, Divine and Crackers use a large knife to cut the bonds and free the two captive women, then hand over the knife. The women emasculate Channing offscreen.Meanwhile, Connie and Raymond burn Divine's beloved trailer to the ground. Upon their return home they are troubled by the behavior of their furniture. Having been \\"cursed\\" by being licked by Divine and Crackers, the furniture \\"rejects\\" the Marbles when they return home: when they try to sit, the cushions fly up, throwing them to the floor. They then find that Channing has bled to death from his castration and the two girls have escaped.After finding the remains of the burned-out trailer, Divine and Crackers return to the Marbles' home. They take them hostage at gunpoint and return to the site of the trailer. Divine calls the local tabloid media to witness the Marbles' trial and execution, as she proclaims her belief in \\"filth politics\\":âBlood does more than turn me on, it makes me cum. And more than the sight of it, I love the taste of it. The taste of hot, freshly killed blood...Kill everyone now! Condone first degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat shit! Filth are my politics! Filth is my life! Take whatever you like.âDivine holds a \\"kangaroo court\\", asks Cotton and Crackers for their biased testimony, and sentences the bound and gagged Marbles to death for \\"first-degree stupidity\\" and \\"assholism\\". Divine sarcastically offers them the opportunity to speak on their own behalf, but they're of course gagged and they move straight to the execution. They tie the Marbles to a tree, coating them in tar and feathers. Divine then shoots them in the head and the media leave shortly afterward, satisfied with their scoop of a \\"live homicide\\". Divine, Crackers, and Cotton talk about where to base their seat of operations next and they enthusiastically decide to relocate to Boise, Idaho, site of a homosexual scandal a few years previously.[11]The legendary ending opens as Crackers, Cotton, and Divine walk down the street, where they spot a dog and its owner. They look at the dog excitedly and hungrily for some reason. Then the dog defecates on the sidewalk, and Divine sits down next to it. She takes the feces in her hand and puts them in her mouth, proving, as the narrator states, that she is \\"not only the filthiest person in the world, but is also the world's filthiest actress\\". She gags twice and grins at the camera. A:","completion":"Question: Which characters live in the pink and green trailer? Answer: Divine, Edie, Crackers, and Cotton.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How to read a stock chart<br>Identify the chart. The first thing to do is identify the chart that you are looking at. Look to the top left hand corner of the chart and you will see the ticker designation, or symbol. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Look to the bottom left hand corner of the chart and you will see the ticker designation, or symbol","completion":"No, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot conclude that the sentence is true. The paragraph specifically states that you should look to the top left-hand corner of the chart to see the ticker designation or symbol. In contrast, the sentence mentions looking at the bottom left-hand corner for the same information. Since there is no additional information given about the bottom left-hand corner, we cannot conclude that the statement is true. To read a stock chart correctly, it's essential to be aware of various elements and how they are presented in the chart. The following are some of the crucial components to consider when reading a stock chart: 1. Ticker Symbol: As mentioned in the paragraph, the ticker symbol or designation can be found at the top left-hand corner of the chart. This symbol represents the abbreviation used to uniquely identify the stock of a company on the stock exchange. 2. Time Frame: Stock charts can display data for different periods, ranging from intraday 1-minute charts to longer-term monthly charts. The time frame can be typically found at the top or bottom of the chart, depending on the charting tool you are using. 3. Price and Volume Data: The main body of a stock chart showcases the price action of the stock over the selected time frame. Various chart types display the price data differently, such as line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts. The volume, or the number of shares traded, can usually be seen as bars at the bottom of the chart, with each bar representing the volume of shares traded for a specific time frame. 4. Moving Averages: Moving averages are important technical indicators that can give an idea of a stock's trend by smoothing out the price data. They are generally plotted as lines on the stock chart. The most commonly used moving averages are the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, but you can also use other time frames based on your trading strategy. 5. Technical Indicators: Various technical indicators can be plotted on a stock chart to help analyze the stock's price performance. Some popular technical indicators include Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands. Each of these indicators can provide valuable insights into the stock's trend, momentum, and potential entry or exit points for trading. 6. Support and Resistance Levels: Support and resistance levels are horizontal lines on a stock chart that indicate the price levels where buying or selling pressure is strong and may influence future price movements. When reading a stock chart, it's essential to understand the data presented and apply appropriate technical analysis tools based on your trading strategy. Keep in mind that every charting tool or platform may have a slightly different layout, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the tool you are using to analyze stock charts accurately."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Your home state will need to verify information on your Medicaid application by cross-referencing it with certain documents in which you may be in possession. Having these documents can help you get benefits to which you’re entitled more quickly. In order to do this, you should have copies of: Your birth certificate, Social Security number, and/or guardianship papers (if applicable). Your driver's license and vehicle registration. Proof of residency in the state in which you are applying for Medicaid. Any pay stubs or other proof of income. Names of your financial institutions and any bank account numbers. Real estate deeds. Unpaid doctor or health care bills. And your Medicare Benefit Card (if applicable). Whether you are filling out a hard copy of an application or answering questions online, make sure to read the entire application and each question carefully and in their entirety before answering them. This can help ensure that you don’t make any mistakes that may disqualify you. The Medicaid application, as well as those that allow you to simultaneously apply for other benefits such as cash assistance, will ask questions about your date of birth, residence, children, pregnancy, and income. You are also likely to answer questions about disabilities and any other pertinent information to assessing your case. Most state Medicaid applications are a set of screens that are displayed for you with a series of questions on each page. It’s absolutely vital to be honest in your answers or to fill out questions to the best of your knowledge. Knowingly falsifying information is a federal crime, while to the best of your knowledge can disqualify you from benefits. Draw upon your at-hand data about income, disabilities, or other qualifying criteria. This information can help you effectively and honestly answer each question. In addition to honesty and answering questions to the best of your knowledge, it’s also important to respond to as many of the questions as you can. This will help the worker who receives your application more quickly and effectively assess your eligibility and the benefits for which you qualify. The application has certain questions that you must answer. If you do not provide this information, you will not be able to proceed on to the next screen of questions or submit your application. Navigating Medicaid can be confusing and daunting for many people. If you have any questions, don’t be shy about contact local or federal Medicaid officials. They’re there to help you and get you benefits as quickly as possible. Schedule a time to meet with a Medicaid officer or a social or human services representative if you still have questions or concerns about your eligibility, or the Medicaid application process. You can also contact your county health department. You can contact these authorities by visiting their offices or calling the local Centers for Medicaid and Medicare at +1 (877) 267-2323. After completing each screen, review your answers to all of your questions. This can help ensure that you have answered all of the questions thoroughly and correctly. If you have lingering questions about certain answers, respond to the best of your knowledge or contact your local Medicaid officer. You must sign your application in order to submit it to state authorities for processing. Anyone over the age of 18 may sign the application. If you submit a hard copy, sign your application with a pen. If you are submitting your application online, you can opt to electronically sign the document. You do not need to submit a signed form via mail or fax if you choose this option. Be aware that only adults over the age of 18 and emancipated minors over the age of 16 can use the electronic signature option. You can submit your Medicaid application either online or by mail or fax. Your home state will not consider your application until you send the application and any supporting materials. Once you’ve submitted, confirm receipt If you are submitting electronically, you will receive a confirmation on a separate page. You can submit your application at the local Medicaid authority or by mail or fax as well. If sending your application by mail, consider using certified mail to confirm delivery. Once you’ve submitted your application, you’ll need to wait for your eligibility, and, where applicable, your benefits determination. This process can take anywhere from a few days to 90 days. Be sure to follow up on the status of your application if you don't receive a response within a reasonable time. If any of the information from your application changes, make sure to report it to the appropriate Medicaid representatives in your area. This can change the status of your application, eligibility, or benefits determination. Because regulations and personal situations are constantly changing, you need to renew your eligibility for Medicaid every year. In most cases, your home state will contact you when your eligibility is about to expire. If you’ve applied for Medicaid in the past, the renewal process is usually not as long as the initial application.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of having proper documents and being thorough when applying for Medicaid.

Write some highlights for the following article: A man who faked his drowning death nearly 20 years ago off a Florida beach was found out by North Carolina police who stopped him for a traffic violation, authorities said Thursday. Bennie Wint told police he faked his drowning death in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1989. Bennie Wint left behind a grieving fiancee and a daughter from a previous marriage. Over the past two decades, he acquired a common-law wife and another child in Marshall, North Carolina. Wint told police he faked his death in Daytona Beach, Florida, because he was \\"paranoid\\" about his narcotics-related activity at the time, Weaverville, North Carolina, police Sgt. Stacy Wyatt told CNN. When pulled over in Weaverville on Saturday because of malfunctioning lights on his license plate, the man said his name was James Sweet, Wyatt said. But when Wyatt ran the name through official databases, he was unable to find any information. \\"I found it suspicious and believed it to be a false name,\\" Wyatt said. He arrested the man on suspicion of driving without a license and giving false information, both misdemeanor offenses, and booked him under the name \\"John Doe.\\" But \\"John Doe\\" finally opened up to Wyatt, admitting he was really Bennie Wint and had been on the run since 1989. Watch how reports of his death were premature ». Wint returned a call Thursday from CNN and asked what an interview with him would be \\"worth to you.\\" Told that CNN does not pay for interviews, he responded, \\"Unless you want to pay for it, don't come up here. You are wasting your time. There are 'no trespassing' signs on my property.\\" He then hung up. According to police reports, Wint was on a trip to Daytona Beach with his then-fiancee, Patricia Hollingsworth. She told police they were engaged and had discussed getting married while on the trip. But it was not to be. On September 25, 1989, Hollingsworth told beach patrol officials that Wint disappeared while swimming. \\"We spent a bunch of time looking for him,\\" said Volusia County Beach Patrol Capt. Scott Petersohn, who was on the beach patrol at the time, although he did not respond to the call. \\"We used helicopters, boats and boatloads of lifeguards.\\" Hollingsworth, then 37, told officials Wint entered the ocean about 4 p.m. and swam past the breakers before she lost sight of him, according to the incident report. The report notes Hollingsworth was \\"very upset\\" and that after contacting officials, she \\"began to run north and south in the area,\\" looking for Wint. Members of the beach patrol, however, thought the supposed drowning was suspicious. \\"It is very rare to drown offshore and not wash back in onto the shore,\\" Petersohn said. In addition, he said, the lifeguard on the beach told officials he did not see anyone swimming in the area. Wyatt submitted Wint's fingerprints to the FBI for identification and, while waiting for the results, searched the Internet for information on a Bennie Wint. \\"I found a daughter that was looking for him,\\" Wyatt said. The woman posted information about her father in 2007, saying he went missing under suspicious circumstances. Wyatt contacted the now-23-year-old woman, who said she was 4 when her father disappeared. Wint has been released from jail and has not been charged in relation to the 1989 incident. It was not known whether he contacted his daughter. Wyatt said Wint now has a common-law wife, a child and a business selling NASCAR items. The night he was arrested, Wyatt said, his wife was \\"distraught\\" upon learning his true identity. Wyatt said Wint told him he was involved in narcotics in the 1970s and '80s, and \\"he ran out of paranoia, thinking people were out to get him.\\" He said he went from Daytona Beach to Ozark, Alabama. CNN's attempts to contact Hollingsworth were unsuccessful, and it was unclear whether she knows Wint is alive. Petersohn said he is attempting to find the lifeguard on duty at Daytona Beach the day Wint disappeared to tell him the truth about the supposed drowning. \\"For 20 years, that man that works for us thinks he might have missed something in the ocean,\\" Petersohn said. \\"I'm glad the guy's alive. I really am. ... It's unfortunate the way it went down at the time, people looking for a body that wasn't out there.\\"","completion":"1.

When legendary Finnish athlete Paavo Nurmi was asked about the reason for his success at the 1924 Olympics despite high-heat conditions, he mentioned what tradition of his country as part of his training?","completion":"Paavo Nurmi, the legendary Finnish athlete, achieved groundbreaking success at the 1924 Olympics held in Paris, France, despite the high-heat conditions, which were not favorable for long-distance runners. Nurmi credited part of his success to a tradition of his country: the Finnish sauna. The Finnish sauna is an integral part of Finnish culture and daily life, known for its potential health benefits and relaxation. Saunas in Finland can be found in households, public spaces, and even in recreational areas. The traditional Finnish sauna consists of a small room or building designed to hold dry heat at temperatures between 80-100 degrees Celsius (176-212 degrees Fahrenheit), while occasionally ladling water onto heated rocks produces steam known as \\"löyly.\\" This hot and humid environment is intended to make the occupants of the sauna sweat, releasing toxins and cleansing the body. Nurmi incorporated the use of saunas in his training regime. Now known as \\"heat training\\" or \\"heat acclimation,\\" Nurmi understood that regularly exposing his body to high heat conditions in the sauna could help to improve his performance on the racetrack by training his body to better cope with heat stress. This practice proved to be beneficial, as it allowed him to cultivate higher endurance and heat tolerance. During heat training, the body undergoes various physiological adaptations in response to heat stress. These adaptations include an increase in blood plasma volume, improved cardiovascular stability, enhanced sweat rate, and a decrease in the body's core temperature. With these adaptations, athletes like Nurmi can delay the onset of fatigue and reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke. By making the Finnish sauna a part of his training routine, Paavo Nurmi was better prepared for the taxing conditions he faced during the 1924 Olympics. Consequently, he secured an astonishing five gold medals in both long-distance and middle-distance track events. Nurmi's achievements on the racetrack, supported by his country's tradition of sauna use and his unique training approach, has made him one of the most revered athletes in the history of sports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An ex-orthopedic surgeon and an architect claim to have discovered the holy grail of fashion footwear: high heels that are genuinely comfortable. Dr Taryn Rose, a 47-year-old single mother-of-three based in California, already built a 40 million business with her first namesake shoe collection, and has now launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund her next chapter: 'wing shoes.' The collection of heels are the brainchild of architect and designer Enrico Cuini, and have specially constructed carbon fiber 'wings' built into the insoles, which support and cushion all three arches of the foot; the medial, lateral and transverse - rather than just the usual one. Scroll down for video. The holy grail? Dr Taryn Rose, a former orthopedic surgeon, and architect Enrico Cuini have created a line of high heeled shoes (pictured, the peep-toe sandal) which boast carbon fiber 'wings' built into the insoles. 'The wings \\"flutter\\" as you walk to provide a pumping action, which helps blood flow back to your heart from your feet,' Dr Rose tells MailOnline. 'This provides comfort and decreases swelling in your feet.' She adds: 'These wings make your feet feel stable, supported and secure, and gives them a \\"platform\\" to rest on so you feel like you are wearing a much lower heel. 'The pressure is relieved from the balls of your feet and your ankle doesn't wobble.' Mr Cuini came up with the first prototype, after which he approached Dr Rose to come on board. Formerly a European Windsurfing champion, Mr Cuini introduced strong but flexible materials to the shoes that are traditionally used to shape and streamline surfboards. Pretty fly: The wings (pictured) support and cushion all three arches of the foot; the medial, lateral and transverse - rather than just the usual one. Secret weapon: The shoes are fitted with hidden platforms to rest on, so you feel like you are wearing a much lower heel. Pictured, the platform stiletto (left) and the classic stiletto (right) Fancy feet: Their design also means that the pressure is relieved from the balls of your feet and your ankle doesn't wobble. Pictured, the laser-cut bootie (left) and the wedge (right) 'Mr Cuini brings a lot of different perspectives and industries to the shoe industry, which hasn't really changed in 100 years,' Dr Rose points out. The collection includes flip-flips and sneakers as well as classic stilettos, platform stilettos, wedges, peep-toe sandals and booties; all in a range of colors. Prices start at 350 and run up to 1995, but donors to the Kickstarter campaign are rewarded with shoes from the line at up to a 50per cent discount. As the company builds its customer base, they aim to lower the prices where possible. The campaign, which is hoping to raise 100,000 by November 5, will fund the manufacturing molds needed for the new wing technology. Teamwork: Mr Cuini (left) came up with the first prototype, after which he approached Dr Rose (right) to come on board with her industry knowledge. Engineered to fit: The wings 'flutter' as you walk to provide a pumping action, which helps blood flow back to your heart from your feet, thus decreasing swelling. Dr Rose explains: 'We felt that with Kickstarter, it's a way for us to build the community from day one. 'This is a way for someone to be a part of our company from the very beginning whether it's a 5 pledge or a 10,000 pledge.' She and Mr Cuini have chosen to donate a sizable portion of the net profits from their shoes to philanthropic causes concerning water, education and health; something that might be unattractive to private investors, but she feels is crucial. So how did Dr Rose make the transition from orthopedic surgeon, to a shoe business she started in her garage, to a multi-millionaire footwear designer? 'As an orthopedic surgeon - and fashionista - I saw women who wanted to wear fashion shoes but suffered from how uncomfortable they can be...especially high heels. 'And of course, I dealt with several broken ankles from women falling off their heels, usually with the help of a few cocktails.' Construction: Dr Rose enlisted architect and engineer Enrico Cuini to help design the collection, and the Kickstarter campaign will fund the molds used to construct the shoes (pictured) Dr Rose, who earned her M.D. from the University of Southern California, was the first to use a memory foam-type material called Poron on shoes she crafted for diabetic patients to absorb shock. She then had the idea to marry the passion she had for her male dominated field - only around ten per cent of foot surgeons were women at the time - and her love of fashion. She became the first designer to use Poron in a line of fashion shoes, a collection she designed in her garage 17 years ago with Mr Cuini. 'When I saw the prototype that he had made on my kitchen table it took me two seconds to realize, \\"this is the real deal... the next big revolution in footwear\\".' Then and now: Dr Rose had the idea to marry the passion she had for orthopedic surgery with and her love of fashion, and gave up her medical career in 1997 to start her first shoe label, which she sold off in 2008. Women loved the shoes and Dr Rose sold her first collection to Nordstrom. Over the next ten years, she stopped practicing as a surgeon and built a 40 million revenue business instead. 'Once I had the time to look at what I had accomplished, I realized I'd actually built a great company,' she recalls. 'It was hard to grasp.' One of the stunts Dr Rose pulled off to prove the merits of her comfortable high heels was to climb 282 steps in a pair of her three-inch pumps. She sold her Taryn Rose line in 2008 and spent the next eight years planning her next move. Mr Cuini came back on board two years ago, and inspired by a butterfly, the new wing technology was born. We're convinced! One of the stunts Dr Rose pulled off to prove the merits of her comfortable high heels was to climb 282 steps in a pair of her three-inch pumps (pictured) The surgeon-turned-designer, who is mom to Anneka, 14, Milo, 10, and Peter, 9, estimates she owns around 287 pairs of shoes currently. 'It's human nature to want to be desirable, and high heels do wonders for that,' she says. 'They make your legs appear more toned and elongated, your lower back more arched and your \\"booty\\" more prominent.' And for those of us who can't wait for her wing shoes to go to on sale, estimated to be June 2015, Dr Rose gave us her top tips for high heel shoe-shopping so as to to avoid ending up in pain. 'Shop at the end of the day when your feet are most swollen, and look for shoes with some form of padding for your forefoot, since there's a lot of pressure in that region,' she advises. 'Look for shoes with a built-in platform to decrease the actual pitch of the shoe, and try not to go with shoes narrower than 1 cm of your own foot.'

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What gives the carrier an advantage over other ships?\\" is in \\"The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.\\".

SEOUL (Reuters) - Excess supplies of large liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are forecast to peak in the third quarter of this year, but will balance out by the fourth, a US research firm said on Friday.","completion":"This article is about the prediction of an oversupply situation in the large liquid crystal display (LCD) market during the third quarter of the year, with a US research firm forecasting that equilibrium will be attained by the beginning of the fourth quarter. A liquid crystal display (LCD) is a type of flat panel display technology that is commonly used in computer monitors, television screens, and other devices, including smartphones, tablets, and even some high-end automotive displays. The significant advantages of LCDs include their thin, lightweight form factor, energy efficiency, and affordability, which have made them a popular choice among consumers for various applications. Excess supplies of large LCDs can be a result of various factors, some of which include: 1. Overproduction: Manufacturers might have overestimated the demand for large LCD panels and produced more units than required, leading to a surplus. This can cause prices to drop as manufacturers scramble to sell the excess inventory. 2. Changes in technology: As new display technologies, such as OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) and microLED, are gaining popularity, the demand for older and less advanced technologies like LCD may decrease over time, again leading to an oversupply. 3. Market shifts: The consumer behavior and preferences for display devices can be unpredictable and may change quickly (e.g., growth in demand for larger displays during the pandemic when people were spending more time at home). An unexpected shift can cause inventory levels to rise more than anticipated. 4. Competition: Increased competition among display manufacturers can result in overproduction as companies try to gain market share by producing more LCD panels in a shorter period. The forecast by the US research firm indicates that the excess supplies of large LCDs will peak in the third quarter of this year. However, they predict that the market forces will work themselves out, and the supply-demand balance will be attained by the beginning of the fourth quarter. This equilibrium can be achieved through various factors, such as: 1. Adjustments in production: Manufacturers may reduce their production capacity or pause the manufacturing process to address the oversupply. 2. Price drops: Lower prices can spur demand and help clear excess inventory. 3. New applications: LCD manufacturers can explore innovative new applications and markets for their products, driving up demand and reducing the surplus. 4. Consolidation: Mergers and acquisitions in the industry can lead to a more balanced production landscape, thereby reducing the likelihood of an oversupply in the market. In conclusion, the article highlights the temporary challenges faced by the large liquid crystal display (LCD) market as it experiences an excess supply situation, causing disruptions in pricing and forcing manufacturers to adapt their strategies. The US research firm's forecast provides some optimism that equilibrium will be achieved by the fourth quarter of the year, allowing the market to stabilize and continue on a more sustainable path."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It took weeks to transverse the prairie but the mountain took mere days, since the","completion":"pass was narrow and relatively easy to navigate. The journey through the mountain proved to be one of the smoothest parts of our entire expedition. Here's how we approached each step to ensure a successful passage. Step 1: Gathering information about the pass We started by talking to locals, experienced guides, and other travelers about the mountain pass. Collecting as much information as possible helped us make informed decisions about the route and potential challenges we might face. This also allowed us to adequately prepare ourselves for the conditions we'd experience during this part of the journey. Step 2: Ensuring proper equipment and supplies Before setting off into the mountains, we made sure that everyone in the group had the necessary gear for the journey, such as warm clothing, sturdy boots, and climbing equipment. Additionally, we stocked up on food, water, and other essentials to sustain us for the duration of our trek through the pass. Step 3: Agreeing on a pace and travel schedule Setting a realistic pace and daily schedule allowed us to stay on track and avoid rushing, which could be dangerous on some of the narrower and steeper paths. By taking regular breaks and setting up camp well before nightfall, we ensured that our group was well-rested and ready to tackle the challenges of the mountain trails. Step 4: Regularly checking weather conditions The weather in the mountains can change suddenly and without warning. By staying abreast of the local weather patterns, we were able to make informed decisions about when to proceed and when to pause our journey due to inclement weather. This helped us avoid getting caught in sudden storms or dangerous conditions. Step 5: Maintaining clear communication Throughout the trek, we emphasized the importance of clear communication within the group. This ensured that everyone was aware of any potential hazards or obstacles, and allowed the team to effectively cooperate in overcoming challenges along the way. Step 6: Adapting the plan as needed We understood the importance of being flexible and adapting our plan as needed. For example, if an unforeseen obstacle made our original path impassable, we discussed alternative routes that could be taken to safely reach our destination. By taking a step-by-step approach, and making careful decisions along the way, we were able to traverse the mountain pass in just a few days. We emerged on the other side, grateful for the breathtaking views and the valuable experiences that had shaped and strengthened our team."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

All mammals have a spinal column, and they are characterized by features like having hair or fur, giving birth to live young (in most cases), and having mammary glands. 2. Birds (Class Aves): Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates characterized by their beaks, feathers, and unique skeletal adaptations for flight. Examples include eagles, sparrows, and penguins. All birds possess a spinal column. 3. Reptiles (Class Reptilia): Reptiles are a group of cold-blooded vertebrates that lay eggs (except some snakes and lizards) and have skin covered in scales. Examples include turtles, snakes, lizards, and crocodiles. Reptiles also have a spinal column. 4. Amphibians (Class Amphibia): Amphibians are cold-blooded vertebrates that usually have an aquatic larval stage and a terrestrial adult stage. They often have moist, permeable skin and include animals like frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts. Like other vertebrates, they too have a spinal column. 5. Fish (Classes Agnatha, Chondrichthyes, and Osteichthyes): Fish are aquatic, gill-bearing vertebrates that can be found in various habitats, from freshwater to saltwater environments. Examples include sharks, eels, and salmon. Fish also possess a spinal column.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The fifth Beatle is an informal title that various commentators in the press and entertainment industry have applied to people who were at one point a member of the Beatles, or who had a strong association with the \\"Fab Four\\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr) during the group's existence. The \\"fifth Beatle\\" claims first appeared in the press immediately upon the band's rise to global fame in 1963-64. The members have offered their own beliefs of the \\"fifth Beatle\\": Lennon was critical of individuals who claimed credit for the Beatles' success, including the individual Beatles themselves, saying in his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, \\"I'm not the Beatles. I'm me. George Martin produced nearly all of the Beatles' recordings (except for the Let It Be album, produced by Phil Spector, and the songs \\"Real Love\\" and \\"Free as a Bird,\\" produced by Jeff Lynne) and wrote the instrumental score for the Yellow Submarine film and soundtrack album, and the string and horn (and even some vocal) arrangements for almost all of their songs (with the famous exception of Spector's re-production on Let It Be, and \\"She's Leaving Home\\", which was arranged by Mike Leander). His arrangement of the string octet backing for \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" was widely noted. Martin's extensive musical training (which he received at the Guildhall School of Music) and sophisticated guidance in the studio are often credited as fundamental contributions to the work of the Beatles; he was without question a key part of the synergy responsible for transforming a good rock-and-roll group into the most celebrated popular musicians of their era. Writer Ian MacDonald noted that Martin was one of the few record producers in the UK at the time who possessed the sensitivity the Beatles needed to develop their songwriting and recording talent. Martin's piano playing also appears on several of their tracks, including \\"Misery\\" and \\"In My Life\\". Martin himself deflected claims of being the \\"fifth Beatle\\" to Beatles' manager Brian Epstein. In 2006, Martin inadvertently strengthened his image as the \\"fifth Beatle\\" by contributing the only piece of new music on the Love soundtrack: a string arrangement on top of George Harrison's solo acoustic demo of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" from Anthology 3. Lennon disparaged Martin's importance to the Beatles' music. In his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, Lennon said, \\"[Dick James is] another one of those people, who think they made us. They didn't. I'd like to hear Dick James' music and I'd like to hear George Martin's music, please, just play me some.\\" In a 1971 letter to Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, \\"When people ask me questions about 'What did George Martin really do for you?,' I have only one answer, 'What does he do now?' I noticed you had no answer for that! It's not a putdown, it's the truth.\\" Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles' music. Commenting specifically on Revolution 9, Lennon said, \\"For Martin to state that he was 'painting a sound picture' is pure hallucination. Ask any of the other people involved. The final editing Yoko and I did alone.\\" In a tribute to George Martin after his death, Paul McCartney said \\"If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle, it was George. From the day that he gave The Beatles our first recording contract, to the last time I saw him, he was the most generous, intelligent and musical person I've ever had the pleasure to know.\\" Julian Lennon called him \\"The Fifth Beatle, without question\\". According to Alan Parsons (2016), Martin had \\"great ears\\" and \\"rightfully earned the title of \\"Fifth Beatle\\". What was one of his last works?","completion":"In 2006, George Martin inadvertently strengthened his image as the \\"fifth Beatle\\" by contributing the only piece of new music on the Love soundtrack: a string arrangement on top of George Harrison's solo acoustic demo of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" from Anthology 3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Apple far decided to start an agroforestry system and other methods to protect their depleted soils, while Pear farm did nothing and had big losses the following years. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm didn't help stabilize the soil? Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is Pear farm that did not take any steps to stabilize or protect their depleted soils. Apple farm, on the other hand, implemented an agroforestry system and employed other methods to address the issue of soil depletion and erosion. By not adopting measures like agroforestry, Pear farm left their soil vulnerable to continued degradation and erosion. The lack of protective groundcover plants, such as naturally growing grasses that are present in agroforestry systems, led to the deterioration of soil quality and stability, resulting in significant losses for the farm in the following years. In contrast, Apple farm decided to take proactive measures by integrating an agroforestry system and utilizing other soil protection methods to improve the overall health and stability of their soil. By doing so, they enhanced soil cover and prevented further erosion. These practices not only helped to maintain a more stable soil structure but also provided additional benefits such as cleaner water by reducing nutrient and soil surface runoff. Through the incorporation of agroforestry and other protective measures, Apple farm managed to create a more sustainable agricultural system with less nutrient loss and healthier soil. Their efforts contributed positively to the overall plant growth and productivity of their farmland. In conclusion, Pear farm is the one that didn't help stabilize their depleted soil, as they failed to implement any protective measures or adopt sustainable practices like their neighboring farm, Apple farm, did. This lack of action on Pear farm's part led to continued soil degradation, erosion, and significant losses in the years that followed."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Jake always tills his land, while Todd uses he no-tillage method. But I can use this background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.

A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine which farmer, Jake or Todd, used fewer chemicals for pest control.

Q:- The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star - The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen - The star becomes a red giant - A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star - The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula - The star leaves behind the core which becomes a dwarf star. What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step in the process of a star evolving into a dwarf star is the main sequence phase, during which a star achieves a state of balance between gravitational forces pulling its matter inward and the outward pressure produced by nuclear fusion. To provide more context, let's examine the complete process in detail: 1. Nebula formation: Stars initially form from vast clouds of gas and dust called nebulae, primarily composed of hydrogen gas. Over millions of years, the forces of gravity cause these clouds to contract and become denser, leading to the formation of a protostar. 2. Main sequence phase: As pressure and temperature increase within the protostar, nuclear fusion begins, wherein hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the process. This energy counteracts the gravitational forces, and a balance is achieved, marking the beginning of the main sequence phase. This is the point at which a star becomes stable and spends most of its life. 3. Star becomes a red giant: As the hydrogen fuel in the core depletes, the core contracts and heats up, causing the outer layers of the star to expand and cool. This transition marks the star's phase as a red giant. 4. Helium fusion and creation of heavier elements: In the core of the red giant, helium undergoes nuclear fusion, forming heavier elements like carbon and oxygen. The production of these elements occurs through the triple-alpha process, in which three helium nuclei combine to create a carbon nucleus, with oxygen being formed by the fusion of additional helium nuclei with carbon. 5. Sheds its outer layers: Once the red giant has exhausted its helium fuel, its outer layers are expelled, leaving a planetary nebula. The material that it sheds contributes to the cosmic enrichment of elements. 6. Formation of a dwarf star: What remains after the shedding of the outer layers is the core, consisting of carbon and oxygen. This core eventually cools and contracts, forming a white dwarf, which is the final stage of evolution for a low- to medium-mass star. This white dwarf will continue to cool over billions of years before eventually becoming a black dwarf - a hypothetical, cold, dark remnant of a star. In summary, the first step in the process of a star evolving into a dwarf star is the main sequence phase, which initiates the star's life cycle and eventually leads to its transformation into a red giant and later, a white dwarf."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If there is an increase in acid in the air, it will lead to MORE damage caused by acid rain. This increase in air acidity will intensify the overall effects of acid rain on the environment. Concerning the second effect mentioned, the increased air acidity will lead to a greater rate of aluminum absorption from the soil into the water. This will occur because the higher concentration of acid in the rainwater will cause more soil acidification, which in turn increases the solubility of aluminum. As a result, more aluminum will be released into lakes, streams, and other water bodies. The elevated levels of aluminum in water can be toxic to aquatic life, including fish and their eggs. As more fish species are affected, the disruption to the aquatic ecosystem will worsen, leading to a decrease in biodiversity and possible local extinctions. Increased aluminum levels can also be harmful to other organisms, such as frogs and plants, which also contribute to the imbalance in the ecosystem.

As for the territory that would eventually become the United States, the pioneering period continued throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, with different European nations setting up colonies. For example, the Spanish established St. Augustine in Florida in 1565, and the English founded Jamestown in Virginia in 1607. The French also made various attempts to colonize the Americas throughout the 17th century. More settlements were founded in the following decades, culminating in the establishment of the 13 British colonies along the eastern seaboard of North America by the early 18th century. The pioneering period continued with westward expansion during the 18th and 19th centuries, as more territories were explored, settled, and eventually incorporated into the United States. In summary, the given answer is incorrect, as it does not address when America was pioneered. A more accurate response would discuss the periods of European exploration and settlement spanning from the late 15th century to the 19th century."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you’ve told your friend how you feel, you might as well clue him in too. While sometimes a crush consists of flirting and subtle hints, it will make the situation easier on everyone if you know where your crush stands. For example, there’s no need to do damage control on your friendship if you discover he likes someone else! Once both of your feelings are out in the open, you are able to decide how to proceed. In other words, don’t betray your friend by blabbing to your crush about her. She may like him and she may be hurt — but that doesn’t mean he needs to know that. Talk to your crush about your own feelings, and let your friend keep hers private if she wishes. Your friend will be hurt and embarrassed if she discovers you’ve been airing her dirty laundry to a boy she has feelings for. A good rule of thumb is to simply speak for yourself. Talk only about your own feelings and desires, not anyone else’s. If the feelings are mutual and you want to proceed with a relationship, take your time. Let your friend adjust to the idea of you two being together before you change your Facebook status and start bringing him as a date to everything. A slow and steady start can make for a healthy, solid relationship, too. That doesn’t mean you need to lie to your friend and pretend that things aren’t happening with your crush. It just means letting her cope with the situation at a slower pace. If your crush doesn’t respect or understand your need to take things slowly, he may not be the right guy for you after all. Summary:","completion":"The article says that if you have feelings for the same boy as your friend, you should only talk to the boy about your own feelings, not your friend's, to make sure you don't hurt your friend's feelings; if the boy likes you back, take things slow to help your friend adjust."},{"prompt":"In north America people are always in a hurry.Children have special lessons or sports activities after school.Parents often work late and don't get home until 7 or 8 o'clock at night.More than 50% of women work at full-time jobs,and many people do part-time work.Most North American families don't have time to eat many meals together.

Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Please Review: I don't know what the reviewers are carrying on about here. It's Evanescence-type dreck with an orchestra. Silly people creating really silly music. Answer: A:","completion":"Based on a thorough analysis of the given product review, it can be concluded that it carries a predominantly negative tone. There are a number of indicators supporting this conclusion, which will be elaborated upon in the following explanation. Firstly, the review mention that the author doesn't know \\"what the reviewers are carrying on about here,\\" suggesting that they do not agree with or understand the positive opinions of others who have reviewed the product. The use of the word \\"carrying on\\" implies that the author sees these positive opinions as exaggerated and perhaps undeserved, further highlighting their disagreement with such sentiments. Moreover, the review describes the music as \\"Evanescence-type dreck with an orchestra.\\" The term \\"dreck\\" carries a negative connotation, as it is often used to refer to something of poor quality, tasteless, or undesirable. By comparing the music to Evanescence, the author may be suggesting that they view the music as derivative or unoriginal, which can also be interpreted as a negative sentiment. Combining these two descriptors certainly reinforces the negative tone of the review. In addition to these observations, the review refers to the people involved in the creation of the music as \\"silly people creating really silly music.\\" The repeated use of the word \\"silly\\" suggests frivolousness and lack of seriousness, indicating that the author does not view the music as having significant artistic value or merit. This derogatory characterization of both the creators and their product further strengthens the negative tone of the review. In conclusion, the overall tone of the product review can be determined as predominantly negative, based on the language and descriptors used by the author. They express disagreement with other reviewers' opinions, use negative terms to describe the music, and criticize the creators as being \\"silly.\\" As a result, their disapproval and negative feelings towards the product are unmistakable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There might be a number of reasons why you think the placement of a lamp in a particular location is not appropriate. Let's discuss some possible factors that may have contributed to this impression: 1. Estetika: Umístění lampy může narušit estetický vzhled místnosti nebo prostoru. Pokud lampa nesouhlasí s designem interiéru nebo poutá pozornost způsobem, který považujete za neatraktivní, pak je pravděpodobné, že považujete její umístění za hloupé. 2. Funkce: Umístění lampy by mělo být praktické a efektivní. Pokud například lampa osvětluje pouze malou část místnosti nebo nedostatečně osvětluje účelovou oblast, pak je možné, že její umístění není vhodné. Také pokud zasahuje do chodníku nebo blokuje výhled z okna, může to být považováno za chybu. 3. Bezpečnost: Bezpečnost by měla být vždy prioritou při umístění osvětlení. Pokud je lampa umístěna na místě, kde může být snadno stržena nebo způsobit risk zranění, je to určitě špatné rozhodnutí. 4. Úspora energie a životní prostředí: Udržitelnost a ekologie jsou důležité aspekty při návrhu interiérů. Pokud lampa spotřebovává více energie, než je potřeba, nebo pokud je umístěna na místě, které generuje nepřiměřené množství tepla nebo oslnění, pak také její umístění může být považováno za hloupé. 5. Dostupnost: Při umístění lampy by měla být zohledněna snadná přístupnost k ovládacím prvkům, ať už jde o vypínač nebo tlačítko na samotné lampě. Pokud je lampa umístěna na místě, kde je těžké ji zapnout nebo vypnout, je to také ukazatel špatného rozhodnutí. Jak vidíte, existuje několik faktorů, které mohou vést k tomu, že umístění lampy je považováno za hloupé.

Write a question about the following article: Just like the earlier match-up, the second game against the Jets was another defensive battle with the game being decided late in the fourth quarter. Four the fourth time in their last five games against the Jets, the Patriots won by three points or less (the exception being the butt-fumble game of 2012). The first seven drives of the game ended in punts. On the second play of the quarter, Amendola returned Ryan Quigley's punt 39 yards to the Jets 36. Eight plays later, Brady hit Gronkowski on a 3-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead. The Jets countered on their next drive marching 87 yards in just over 6 minutes, scoring on Geno Smith's 20-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Cumberland to tie the game. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets drove 54 yards to the Patriots 8, but, like the first match-up, had to settle for a 26-yard field goal by Nick Folk and a 10-7 lead at halftime. The Patriots offensive line was dominated by Sheldon Richardson and the Jets defensive line, as they sacked Brady four times in the first half. The Patriots received the second-half kickoff, but were forced to punt. The Jets capitalized by marching 66 yards in just over 6 minutes to the Patriots 5-yard line, but only could muster a 23-yard field goal from Folk, extending the lead to 13-7. The Patriots drove 81 yards to the Jets 6, but Brady threw an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-2 and Gostkowski kicked a 24-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 13-10. On the second play of the Jets next drive, Smith was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Jets 40-yard line, he lateraled to Browner who reached the Jets 38. Eight plays later Jonas Gray scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Patriots a 17-13 lead on the third play of the fourth quarter. The Jets drove 59 yards to the Patriots 10, but on 2nd-and-8, Smith was sacked by Sealver Siliga for a 9-yard loss and an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-17 forced them to settle for a 37-yard field goal by Folk, trimming the deficit to 17-16 with 7:53 remaining. On the second play of the Patriots' next drive, Brady was intercepted by Marcus Williams at the Patriots 30-yard line. After two runs for 6 yards, Smith was sacked for a 10-yard loss on 3rd down by Dont'a Hightower, setting up Folk's 52-yard go-ahead field goal attempt, but Vince Wilfork blocked Folk's attempt, keeping the Patriots ahead 17-16. On the Patriots' next drive, two third-down conversions allowed the Patriots to run out the clock. With the win, the Patriots improved to 12-3, and they clinched home field advantage throughout the playoffs after the Broncos' loss to the Bengals on Monday night. This would wind up being Rex Ryan's last game against the Patriots as head coach of the New York Jets. The Patriots were far from outstanding on offense. Brady finished 23/35 but for just 146 yards and 1 touchdown with 1 interception. The Patriots combined for just 85 rushing yards on 24 carries, but the defense came through again.

Victor was a 29-year-old grown-up who worked as a helper near big red trucks with sirens that are called firetrucks. His job was to help people when they are not feeling well, and that made him an EMT in the fire department. One day, while they were in their house, Victor did something very scary. He took out a tool called a gun and showed it to his wife in a way that made her feel very afraid. Guns are dangerous things that can hurt people, so Mrs. Cadicamo knew she needed help right away. Mrs. Cadicamo did a very brave thing. She called a special phone number, 911, which is the number we call when we need help from police officers. Police officers are people who make sure everyone is safe and follow the rules. When the police officers arrived at their house, they searched all around the inside, and they discovered that Victor had hidden many dangerous things in their home. They found not one, not two, but five scary tools called firearms and a big long stick called a rifle. What they found next was even scarier: two round things called pipe bombs, which are very dangerous and can hurt a lot of people when they explode. The police officers took all the dangerous things away from the house, so Mrs. Cadicamo and her family would be safe again. Thanks to Mrs. Cadicamo's bravery in calling 911, police officers were able to protect her and make sure that no one got hurt by those scary things hidden in their home. The story shows how important it is to be brave and ask for help when we are in trouble or something is making us feel unsafe.

Ashkenazi Jews, also known as Ashkenazic Jews or simply Ashkenazim (Hebrew: ash@k@'nazi'ym, Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation: [,aSk@'nazim], singular: [,aSk@'nazi], Modern Hebrew: [aSkena'zim, aSkena'zi]; also y@hv'dey ash@k@'naz Y'hudey Ashkenaz), are a Jewish diaspora population who coalesced as a distinct community in the Holy Roman Empire around the end of the first millennium. The traditional diaspora language of Ashkenazi Jews is Yiddish (a Germanic language which incorporates several dialects), with Hebrew used only as a sacred language until relatively recently. Throughout their time in Europe, Ashkenazim have made many important contributions to philosophy, scholarship, literature, art, music and science. Ashkenazim originate from the Jews who settled along the Rhine River, in Western Germany and in Northern France. The name Ashkenazi derives from the biblical figure of Ashkenaz, the first son of Gomer, son of Japhet, son of Noah, and a Japhetic patriarch in the Table of Nations (Genesis 10). The name of Gomer has often been linked to the ethnonym Cimmerians. Biblical Ashkenaz is usually derived from Assyrian Askuza (cuneiform Askuzai/Iskuzai), a people who expelled the Cimmerians from the Armenian area of the Upper Euphrates, whose name is usually associated with the name of the Scythians. The intrusive n in the Biblical name is likely due to a scribal error confusing a waw v with a nun n. In Jeremiah 51:27, Ashkenaz figures as one of three kingdoms in the far north, the others being Minni and Ararat, perhaps corresponding to Urartu, called on by God to resist Babylon. In the Yoma tractate of the Babylonian Talmud the name Gomer is rendered as Germania, which elsewhere in rabbinical literature was identified with Germanikia in northwestern Syria, but later became associated with Germania. Ashkenaz is linked to Scandza/Scanzia, viewed as the cradle of Germanic tribes, as early as a 6th-century gloss to the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius. In the 10th-century History of Armenia of Yovhannes Drasxanakertc'i (1.15) Ashkenaz was associated with Armenia, as it was occasionally in Jewish usage, where its denotation extended at times to Adiabene, Khazaria, Crimea and areas to the east. His contemporary Saadia Gaon identified Ashkenaz with the Saquliba or Slavic territories, and such usage covered also the lands of tribes neighboring the Slavs, and Eastern and Central Europe. In modern times, Samuel Krauss identified the Biblical \\"Ashkenaz\\" with Khazaria. Sometime in the early medieval period, the Jews of central and eastern Europe came to be called by this term. Conforming to the custom of designating areas of Jewish settlement with biblical names, Spain was denominated Sefarad (Obadiah 20), France was called Tsarefat (1 Kings 17:9), and Bohemia was called the Land of Canaan. By the high medieval period, Talmudic commentators like Rashi began to use Ashkenaz/Eretz Ashkenaz to designate Germany, earlier known as Loter, where, especially in the Rhineland communities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz, the most important Jewish communities arose. Rashi uses leshon Ashkenaz (Ashkenazi language) to describe German speech, and Byzantium and Syrian Jewish letters referred to the Crusaders as Ashkenazim. Given the close links between the Jewish communities of France and Germany following the Carolingian unification, the term Ashkenazi came to refer to both the Jews of medieval Germany and France.

The most common form of oxymoron involves an adjective--noun combination of two words, but they can also be devised in the meaning of sentences or phrases. One classic example of the use of oxymorons in English literature can be found in this example from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, where Romeo strings together thirteen in a row: do oxymorons have to be next to each other?","completion":"No, oxymorons do not always have to be placed directly next to each other to be effective. An oxymoron is a figure of speech where two contradictory or opposites words or ideas are combined to create a unique, paradoxical concept, often for emphasis or poetic expression. Although the most common form of oxymoron consists of an adjective-noun combination (e.g., \\"deafening silence,\\" \\"bittersweet\\"), oxymorons can also be created through phrases or even sentences. The essential feature of an oxymoron is the presence of contrasting elements that bring thought-provoking and expressive depth to its meaning rather than a requirement for the words to be in immediate proximity. Therefore, oxymorons can be spread out through a phrase or sentence while maintaining their effect. This can be seen in various literary works, including Shakespeare's plays and modern literature, where oxymorons are often employed to delicately convey complex emotions, situations, or descriptions. For instance, in the previously mentioned example from Romeo and Juliet, we see the use of several oxymorons. However, they are not presented as simple adjective-noun pairs; some of them are found within phrases, such as \\"feather of lead.\\" In this case, the oxymoron is distributed over several words while still evoking the contradictory juxtaposition of lightness and heaviness as a metaphor for Romeo's emotional turmoil. It is important to note that the key to identifying an oxymoron lies in the internal contradiction that the pairing creates—even when the words are not directly adjacent. When two or more contrasting words come together to produce an intentionally illogical, contradictory, or thought-provoking concept, you have an oxymoron, irrespective of whether they are placed next to each other or spaced out within a larger phrase or sentence. In summary, the essence of oxymorons lies in their ability to create a paradoxical or contradictory meaning rather than in their physical positioning within a text. Consequently, while many oxymorons consist of directly adjacent adjective-noun combinations, the crucial characteristic of an oxymoron is the contrast it presents, which can be achieved even when the contradicting words or ideas are not placed immediately next to each other."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Paragraph: When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

Como rey, Enrique IV tenía la capacidad de tomar decisiones importantes y definitivas en relación con las cuestiones territoriales y de gobierno en su reino. Luego de examinar la disputa, tomó la decisión que el Valle debería ser gobernado en concordancia con las Ordenanzas que aplicaban a las comunidades de Álava. Con esto, la zona del Valle se separó de Burgos y comenzó a seguir un conjunto diferente de reglas y regulaciones, las cuales estaban más a tono con sus propias necesidades e intereses.

A goatee is a versatile beard that can look good on many faces, though you may find another beard type that will look better on you. The starker the contrast, the more dramatic your goatee will appear. If the colors are close together, you may want to consider another kind of facial hair style if distinctive and noticeable is what you are going for. Traditionally, a goatee refers only to the hair that grows off your chin, which hangs down like that of a goat. There are other forms of beards that use hair on the chin, and are sometimes referred to as “goatees.” You’ll want to choose the one that best enhances your face, and that you are best prepared to take care of. Look through magazines and websites for pictures of goatee variations that you might want to experiment with. This is a goatee with a disconnected mustache. When wearing a Van Dyke, the rest of your cheeks should be completely shaved and smooth. If you grow a Van Dyke, you’ll want to take special care that it stays trim, as it looks better when the beard is more defined. This is a goatee connected to a mustache that grows in a circle around your mouth. This is a fuller beard, but not so much that it covers your whole face. A circle beard is a great choice for a man with a softer jaw line, or if you have a squarish face or jaw. Because it has a lot of hair, a circle beard can also help to cover up skin breakouts. This look combines a goatee with a Hungarian mustache. This is a more labor intensive beard, but definitely a distinctive one. With a Musketeer, you’ll want to keep your goatee trim, but let it grow a little longer down your chin. Because of the thickness, you’ll want to use some wax or conditioner to help the hair keep its shape.

The circle beard connects the mustache and the goatee, making it suitable for those with softer jawlines or squarish faces.

The agent of revelation is mentioned as the \\"one mighty in power\\", the one who \\"grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer.\\" The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the Encyclopaedia of Islam that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, because he was severely disturbed after these revelations. According to Welch, these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a possessed man, a soothsayer or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient Arabia.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. Question: What issue did the author want to address with participants of the study? Options: A. to prove it doesn't matter when food is eaten, but it matters what type of foods are eaten B. to change unhealthy dietary habits C.

By Associated Press PUBLISHED: 19:09 EST, 12 March 2013 | UPDATED: 19:46 EST, 12 March 2013 A case involving an Air Force general who dismissed charges against a lieutenant colonel convicted of sexual assault will be reviewed at the top levels of the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a letter released on Monday. But it seems unlikely that the ruling would be changed. Hagel said that under military law, neither he nor the Air Force secretary has the authority to reverse Lt Gen Craig Franklin's decision to overturn the November conviction against Lt Col James Wilkerson, a former inspector general at Aviano Air Base in Italy. OPTIONS: - Air Force was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Associated Press was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Aviano Air Base was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Chuck Hagel was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Craig Franklin was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Hagel was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Italy was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - James Wilkerson was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Pentagon was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Sen Barbara Boxer was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman.","completion":"Lt Col James Wilkerson was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault, and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. Despite the conviction, Lt Gen Craig Franklin dismissed the charges, a decision that has sparked controversy and prompted the review by top Pentagon officials. As stated by Secretary Hagel, the issue at hand is that neither he nor the Air Force secretary has the authority to overturn Lt Gen Franklin's decision. This situation has led to widespread criticism and concerns about how the military handles and prosecutes sexual assault cases within its ranks. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., have called for changes in the military justice system that would prevent commanding officers from having the ability to overturn convictions or reduce sentences after a military panel has issued a verdict. In response to the case, the Pentagon has been urged to review and possibly reform its policies and procedures when dealing with cases of sexual assault. The need for a transparent and fair process has been emphasized, ensuring that those who commit such crimes are held accountable while also protecting the rights of the accused. The outcome of the review at the Pentagon is uncertain, but it is clear that the case of Lt Col James Wilkerson has brought the prevalent issue of sexual assault in the military to the forefront of public attention. It remains to be seen whether concrete changes to the military justice system will be enacted as a result, but this case may serve as a catalyst for further examination and potential reform."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Invincible Movie plot: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts.

After getting supplies, he takes a canoe to the far shore, where he is nearly killed by a jaguar, but is saved by the native, Indian-like people. He decides to prove his bravery by not moving once he sees the chief, Runi (Sessue Hayakawa) and telling his story. The Indians are impressed, and do not kill him. After a while, Runi's son Kua-ko (Henry Silva), who has lived with the missionaries of Caracas and speaks English, tells Abel that Runi has agreed so long as he does not harm them, they will not harm him. Abel agrees, and befriends Kua-ko, who tells him of the \\"Bird Woman\\", who killed his older brother, and that their tribe is not allowed in the nearby forest.

Question 1: Is eating rice good if I want a six-pack? What is the diet for a six-pack? Question 2: Can I get a six pack without sticking to a certain diet? If so, how? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Before I address each question individually, let us understand the concept of obtaining a six-pack. Developing a six-pack primarily involves building and defining the abdominal muscles, which requires consistent exercise and a healthy, balanced diet. While specific dietary choices can influence your progress, it is important to maintain a healthy balance for overall well-being. Question 1: Step 1: Determine if rice is good for individuals wanting a six-pack. Rice is a source of carbohydrates, and carbohydrates are an essential macronutrient for providing energy. Since whole grains and complex carbohydrates are better for maintaining stable blood sugar levels and preventing hunger, brown rice would be the preferable option in this case. Step 2: Propose a diet for a six-pack. A six-pack diet should be balanced and focus on macronutrients like protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats, as well as overall caloric intake. This includes: - Lean proteins: Chicken, fish, tofu, beans, and legumes. - Complex carbohydrates: Brown rice, whole grains, sweet potatoes, and quinoa. - Vegetables: Leafy greens, broccoli, and bell peppers. - Healthy fats: Avocado, nuts, and olive oil. - Water: Keep hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Question 2: Step 1: Determine if a six-pack can be a achieved without sticking to a certain diet. While diet plays a crucial role in developing a six-pack and improving overall body composition, it is possible to achieve a six-pack without adhering to a strict diet plan. It would, however, likely take longer and the results might not be as well-defined. Step 2: Suggest methods for achieving a six-pack without a specific diet. To achieve a six-pack without following a specific diet, you must have a consistent exercise routine, especially focusing on core strengthening and abdominal workouts. Incorporate cardio and resistance training as well to support muscle growth and reduce body fat. Now, let me address if the answers to these two questions are the same. The answers to both questions are related but not the same. The first question addresses eating rice and a diet for obtaining a six-pack, while the second question pertains to the possibility of achieving a six-pack without strict dietary guidelines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Alternating current will flow through a capacitor until the source of the current is removed. That current can add to the shock you'll get if you mishandle the capacitor, and may keep recharging it. Explanation: The question asks us to continue the paragraph about discharging a capacitor, which is a safety procedure to avoid the risk of electric shock. Answer III is the best choice as it explains the flow of alternating current through a capacitor and the potential risks associated with it. I. Intact capacitors are very likely to have an electrical discharge if the capacitor is not connected. Inspect the capacitor before removing it from the circuit. This answer is incorrect because it focuses on inspecting the capacitor before removing it rather than on the process of discharging a capacitor. II. Fix any problems while running a circuit. When running an circuit, a capacitor does not supply current to the items in it. This option is incorrect as it discusses fixing problems while running a circuit, which is unrelated to discharging a capacitor. IV.

Meanwhile, the Steelers ran up and down the field with QB Ben Roethlisberger's 13-yard TD pass to TE Heath Miller and RB Najeh Davenport's 1-yard and 5-yard TD run. With the loss, the Seahawks fell to 3-2. This would mark Seattle's first shut-out loss since Week 1 of the 2000 season, when the Seahawks lost to the Dolphins 23-0. Head Coach Mike Holmgren would suffer only his second career shutout loss. Question: How long was the longer TD run?

The answer is yes. Lightning is a form of static discharge. It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below.

The Seaside Park, New Jersey boardwalk emerged relatively unscathed from the October 29 storm compared to its neighbor Seaside Heights. But Sandy left her indelible mark after all, last Thursday when a raging fire blazed through 80 buildings across three blocks of the resort town. The fire began at a frozen custard stand, where aged wiring that had been compromised by salt water and sand sparked what would eventually become an inferno, federal and county investigators said at a Tuesday news conference.

Question: Where does Quasimodo lives inside his entire life? Title: The Hunchback of Notre Dame Movie plot: Quasimodo being offered water by Esmeralda. The story is set in Paris in 1482. Quasimodo is a deaf, half-blind, hunchbacked bell-ringer of the famous Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. His master Jehan, the evil brother of Notre Dame's saintly archdeacon Don Claudio, prevails upon the hunchback to kidnap the fair Esmeralda, a dancing gypsy girl (and the adopted daughter of Clopin, the king of the oppressed beggars of Paris' underworld). The dashing Captain Phoebus rescues Esmeralda from Quasimodo, while Jehan abandons him and flees. At first seeking a casual romance, Phoebus becomes entranced by Esmeralda, and takes her under his wing. Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the public square. After being whipped, he begs for water. Esmeralda pities him, and brings him some. To their dismay, Jehan and Clopin both learn that Phoebus hopes to marry Esmeralda, despite being engaged to Fleur de Lys. Phoebus persuades Esmeralda to accompany him to a ball celebrating his appointment as Captain of the Guard by King Louis XI. He provides her with rich garments and introduces her to their hostess, Madame de Gondelaurier, as a Princess of Egypt. Clopin, accompanied by his beggars, crashes the festivities and demands Esmeralda be returned. To avoid bloodshed, Esmeralda says that she does not belong with the aristocracy. Later, however, Esmeralda sends the street poet Pierre Gringoire to give Phoebus a note, arranging a rendezvous at Notre Dame to say goodbye to him. Before Phoebus arrives, he is stabbed in the back by Jehan. After Esmeralda is falsely sentenced to death for the crime, she is rescued from the gallows by Quasimodo and carried inside the cathedral, where he and Don Claudio grants her sanctuary. Don Claudio restrains Quasimodo from violence. Later that night, Clopin leads the whole of the underworld to storm the cathedral, and Jehan attempts to take Esmeralda, first by guile (telling her that Phoebus's dying wish was for him to take care of her), then by force.

Question: Information: - Norse mythology is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. - In Norse mythology , Baugi is a giant . He is the son of Gilling , brother of Suttungr and paternal uncle of Gunnlöð . Baugi is attested to in Skáldskaparmál in Snorri 's Prose Edda , and does not appear in other texts . Due to his absence in other relevant mythological texts , numerous scholars have argued that Baugi either comes from a source that is not extant today or was an invention of Snorri 's , accidental or intentional . - Germanic mythology consists of the body of myths native to the Germanic peoples. Commonly featuring narratives focused on Germanic deities and a large variety of other entities, Germanic mythology dates from the Proto-Germanic period and reaches beyond the Christianization of the Germanic peoples and into modern Germanic folklore. Germanic mythology includes Norse mythology, Anglo-Saxon mythology, and Continental Germanic mythology. - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. - In Norse mythology, Suttungr was a \\"jötunn\\", a son of Gilling, who (along with Suttungr's mother) had been murdered by Fjalar and Galar. - The jötunn (anglicized jotunn or jotun, plural jötnar , or ; Old Norse jtunn , Icelandic jötunn ; often glossed as \\"giant\\" or \\"ettin\\") are a mythological race that live in Jötunheimr, one of the nine worlds of Norse cosmology. They were banished there by the Æsir who refused them entry to their world, Asgard. The Jötnar can be seen throughout Norse mythology. They frequently interact with the Æsir, as well as the Vanir. They are usually in opposition to, or in competition with them, but also interact with them in a non-hostile manner. Some Jötnar even intermarry with the Æsir and Vanir, and many are named as parents or grandparents of Æsir such as Thor and Odin. This very complex relationship between these two comparable races develops most notably in the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda, ultimately making it difficult to distinguish them from the more familiar Norse gods.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve this math problem Solve 0 = -85*w + 15*w - 3020 + 3510 for w.","completion":"Alright, let's break this problem down. 1. First, let's add all the terms with \\"w\\" and the constant terms separately. We know that \\"-85w\\" and \\"15w\\" are like terms (terms with the same variable), so we can add them together: -85w + 15w equals \\"-70w\\". 2. Similarly, \\"-3020\\" and \\"3510\\" are like terms (just plain old numbers) as well, so you can add them together. When we subtract 3020 from 3510, we get \\"490\\". 3. So now, our equation is \\"0 = -70w + 490\\". 4. Next, to solve for 'w', we want to isolate 'w'. We need to move \\"+ 490\\" from the right of the equals sign to the left. Remember, doing something to one side of the equation means we have to do the same thing to the other side. So if we subtract 490 from the right side we have to subtract 490 on the left side too. This means we subtract 490 from both sides, we get \\"-490 = -70w\\". 5. Now we have \\"-490 = -70w\\". The final step is to remove \\"-70\\" from the right side of the \\"=\\" sign. Because \\"-70\\" is being multiplied by \\"w\\", we do the opposite to get rid of it, which is dividing. So if we divide \\"-490\\" by \\"-70\\", we get \\"7\\". So, the answer to your question \\"w\\" is \\"7\\". Imagine you have 70 apples happily hanging out with their friend w. Suddenly, they got separated and couldn't hang out with 'w' anymore, causing sadness (minus 490). To make them happy again and bring back their friend 'w', you need to spread the sadness (minus 490) among all 70 apples. When you do this (dividing -490 by -70), you find out that you need 7 happy things (maybe candies) to offset each apple's sadness and bring back their friend 'w'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Areas of Expertise: Boll is known for his editorial and biographical work on Claudius Ptolemy. He also had a strong interest in astrology and authored several writings related to the subject. 3. Perspective on Astrology: Boll believed that astrology sought to be both religion and science simultaneously, as evident in his quote: \\"Astrology wants to be religion and science at the same time; that marks its essence.\\" He also mentioned that mankind measures time using the stars, and that laypeople often say, \\"The course of the stars determines time,\\" which leads religious people to believe that \\"heaven guides everything on earth.\\" 4. Views on the Book of Revelation: Boll claimed that the Book of Revelation contained an allegorical representation of the shift in astrological ages from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius. In his view, the apocalypse mentioned in the book is not the end of the world, but rather the end of an aeon. 5. Contributions to the History of Astrology: Boll wrote numerous astrological articles throughout his career. Along with Gundel and Bezold, he produced a comprehensive and well-regarded introduction to the history of astrology. In summary, Franz Boll was a philologist and professor with a keen interest and expertise in astrology. He was known for his contributions to the field, particularly in the areas of Claudius Ptolemy's works and the historical understanding of astrology.

Please answer the following question: When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it’s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next… to turning them into rose petal jam, of course. My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.

In the late 1200s Marco Polo, the great explorer, is said to have seen rich Asians eating dishes of ice. Camels had brought the ice from distant mountains. Before it was served, the ice had been flavored with fruits. Marco Polo brought this new dish to Italy, In France cooks changed the ice recipe and made ice cream. At first, cooks tried to keep the recipe a secret. They wanted it to be a special dish for rich people. By the late 1700s, though, ice cream was sold throughout Europe and America. Some great Americans loved ice cream. George Washington was the first to buy a special machine for making it. When Thomas Jefferson returned from France, he brought an ice cream recipe home with him. Dolly Madison, wife of President James Madison, also liked ice cream, and she often served it at the White House. Actually, a famous brand of ice cream was even named after her.

It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock, experimental rock, and experimental pop.The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently features Moog synthesizers. Lætitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music. In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in Wire that Sadier \\"display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico\\", while some critics have commented that her vocals were unintelligible.

Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the birds that returned through Sudan is the northern bald ibis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Vice President Cheney called Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5, 2001, to seek Saudi help in preventing threatened attacks on American facilities in the Kingdom. Secretary of State Powell met with the crown prince twice before 9/11. They discussed topics like Iraq, not al Qaeda.U.S.-Saudi relations in the summer of 2001 were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing Israeli- Palestinian violence, not about Bin Laden. The confirmation of the Pentagon's new leadership was a lengthy process. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was confirmed in March 2001 and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith in July. Though the new officials were briefed about terrorism and some of the earlier planning, including that for Operation Infinite Resolve, they were focused, as Secretary Rumsfeld told us, on creating a twenty-first-century military. At the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton did not recall much interest by the new administration in military options against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He could not recall any specific guidance on the topic from the secretary. Brian Sheridan-the outgoing assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict (SOLIC), the key counterterrorism policy office in the Pentagon-never briefed Rumsfeld. He departed on January 20; he had not been replaced by 9/11. Rumsfeld noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his regular meetings with Tenet. He thought that the Defense Department, before 9/11, was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new threats like terrorism. But his time was consumed with getting new officials in place and working on the foundation documents of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the defense planning guidance, and the existing contingency plans. He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system. The commander of Central Command, General Franks, told us that he did not regard the existing plans as serious. To him a real military plan to address al Qaeda would need to go all the way, following through the details of a full campaign (including the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the rights to fly over neighboring countries. The draft presidential directive circulated in June 2001 began its discussion of the military by reiterating the Defense Department's lead role in protecting its forces abroad.

Back home we refer to carbonated drinks as cold drinks. So, when he asked me to have a pop,I thought he was referring to popcorn. I said,very politely,\\"No,thank you.I am not hungry.\\" He had a puzzled look on his face, one that I did not figure out for at least a week or so until somebody pointed out to me that pop meant soda and had nothing to do with corn. Speaking of pop,my very first night at Winona State University,Bangladeshi students took me to a restaurant named Papa John's. I ordered my meal and finally asked for a Pepsi.The waitress handed me an aluminum can. Now,back home we have only bottled pop drinks,and the only time I was exposed to a can was on an airplane. However,those cans were a bit different because one could open it by pulling on the tab,which came off.Imagine my embarrassment as I tried to use the same technique at the restaurant.Obviously,the tab would not come off when I struggled with the can,and I spilled the pop all over the table. My fellow Bangladeshi students and a few others at the nearby tables got a good laugh out of this.Finally,one of them showed me how to use that device. Bangladeshi cuisine is definitely spicier and usually hotter than Midwestern food.I conveyed this to my American friends whenever we talked about cuisine.Well,last fall,I was down in Orono,Minnesota,at my friend Steve Haack's house.He had told his mother all these horror stories about how I loved \\"hot\\" food.So,when it was time for Sunday brunch,I found out how Steve's mother had decided to whet my appetite.She baked some spicy enchiladas ,and she had used one full 16-ounce can of jalapeno peppers.

He reveled in discovering the stories that each artwork held, not only in their visual narratives but also in their physicality. Not that Kevin despised technology. He acknowledged that computers have revolutionized art history research by providing access to extensive resources, but he still preferred the tactile sensations of leafing through books and poring over prints, as well as the thrill of visiting museums and galleries. It is in these spaces that he felt more capable of understanding and appreciating the artists' intentions and the socio-cultural circumstances that shaped the birth of a particular masterpiece.

Process: - You breathe in - Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose chest has mucous happens, how will it affect more carbon dioxide switched with oxygen. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of mucus in the chest or lungs can directly affect the process of gas exchange - the switch of carbon dioxide with oxygen. Mucus is a normal and necessary substance produced by the lining of the respiratory system. It aids in trapping particles like dust and microbes, and in moisturizing the air passages. However, excessive mucus, such as in certain respiratory conditions like chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, or pneumonia, can clog the bronchioles and alveoli, the small airways and air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. Because of the mucus, the airways become narrower and may get blocked. The flow of air in and out of the lungs is then impeded, which complicates the exchange of gases. When the oxygen cannot efficiently reach the alveoli, the level of oxygen that enters the bloodstream decreases. Similarly, carbon dioxide gets trapped and can't be exhaled efficiently, leading to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. In summary, the perturbation of excessive mucus in the chest or lungs can cause serious breathing problems and directly impact the body's gas exchange, thus causing lower oxygen uptake and build-up of carbon dioxide. This can result in symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, and in severe cases, can lead to respiratory failure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Product review: I have read, in quick succession, all three books in this series; The Giver, Gathering Blue, and The Messenger.I read them all in hopes of coming to a satisfying conclusion to the story - but in this I felt cheated! The books are wonderful, don't get me wrong. Exciting, fast paced, terrific stories and characters. But on the last page (I have the kindle edition) I found myself repeatedly trying to page forward, as in each book it felt as if it hadn't ended. Not simply because I wanted more - but because in each case, it felt unfinished....One more page, one more paragraph - anything except stranding me in the middle of a story. I thought this was simply to make me continue to read the sequel, but even the concluding book left me in a lurch. I do not think I will be reading Lowry again any time soon. Her lack of endings is just too frustrating for me! Answer:","completion":"This review would likely decrease the chances of you buying the product.

His plea for asylum comes on the heels of Ecuador granting political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, less than a week prior. Barankov has unearthed serious allegations of corruption within President Lukashenko's ranks, revealing illicit activities that have potential to destabilize the Belarusian government. The situation has quickly garnered attention, with many keeping a close eye on the outcome of Barankov's asylum request. Despite Ecuador's recent track record of granting asylum to political fugitives, Barankov's fate remains uncertain due to a recent visit by President Lukashenko to Ecuador.

Summarize this article: The Blues were ahead inside seven minutes when Nemanja Matic flicked on Eden Hazard's corner for Diego Costa to smash home. A David Luiz free-kick struck the post, before Pedro played in Hazard, who rounded Kasper Schmeichel to slot in. Luiz hit his own post when clearing a cross, but Victor Moses' finish after a one-two with substitute Nathaniel Chalobah completed the scoring. Leicester, who left Riyad Mahrez on the bench for the first time in 36 league games, failed to register a shot on target as they struggled to cope against Chelsea's aggressive pressing and quick passing. Defeat leaves Claudio Ranieri's side with eight points from their first eight games - the joint second lowest haul by a defending Premier League champion, along with Chelsea's team of last season. Relive Chelsea v Leicester Since joining Chelsea from Leicester this summer, N'Golo Kante has found himself doing slightly less of the defensive work that established him as such a prized midfielder at the King Power Stadium. But he continues to enjoy the gift of being in the right place at the right time and this was another excellent performance from the France international - who is clearly missed by Claudio Ranieri's side. However, much of Chelsea's success in stifling the visitors came courtesy of their wing-backs. When Marcos Alonso - making his home debut - harried Danny Drinkwater high up the pitch to win the ball back and deliver a dangerous low cross, he was repeating the pattern set by Moses on the opposite right flank. Instead we saw the other side of Kante's game. The 25-year-old would have scored Chelsea's third had it not been for Foxes captain Wes Morgan, who made a brilliant block after a Costa cross spilled off Schmeichel's legs to leave the goalmouth exposed. And his perfectly weighted through ball deserved a better finish from Moses, who eventually did settle the points for certain when latching on to a delightful flick by 21-year-old English midfielder Chalobah - making his senior home debut after six loan spells away from the club. On Thursday, several bookmakers suspended betting on Chelsea boss Conte being the next Premier League manager to lose his job. The Italian laughed off the rumours in his news conference on Friday -\\"I am trying to find out who put the money on\\" - but some may have wondered if there would be a sign of weakness in his side's performance. There was not. Chelsea began with real swagger and Costa's early goal was the end product. The Premier League's top scorer gambled on a late move to the back post and, as Morgan did not stay with him, was left with an easy finish for his seventh of the campaign. It took the 28-year-old Spain striker until January to reach that total last season. The dipping Luiz free-kick that crashed against the post would have been a fitting second, so when Hazard found himself through on goal after a slightly lucky bounce it was hard to deny a 2-0 lead was deserved. The Belgium winger showed superb composure for his third goal from eight matches this season - compared to four from 31 last term. And one of the finest flourishes came from Conte himself. There was a huge round of cheers from the home crowd when he brilliantly trapped a misplaced long pass that plummeted down into his technical area. The fans will have found it hard not to have been incredibly impressed by their team's performance - especially after what they witnessed over 2015-16. Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \\"When you concede a goal from a corner again it is clear: you come to Chelsea and your attention must be at the maximum. We made mistakes. We tried to react and the second half was much better. Now we must react because we have the Champions League on Tuesday. \\"If we scored the goal when we create a chance we can re-open the match.

He is called the \\"Spiritual Father of Pakistan.\\" He is considered one of the most important figures in Urdu literature, with literary work in both Urdu and Persian. In 1933, after returning from a trip to Spain and Afghanistan, Iqbal suffered from a mysterious throat illness. He spent his final years helping Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan to establish the Dar ul Islam Trust Institute at Jamalpur estate near Pathankot, where there were plans to subsidise studies in classical Islam and contemporary social science. He also advocated for an independent Muslim state. Iqbal ceased practising law in 1934 and was granted a pension by the Nawab of Bhopal. In his final years, he frequently visited the Dargah of famous Sufi Ali Hujwiri in Lahore for spiritual guidance. After suffering for months from his illness, Iqbal died in Lahore on 21 April 1938. His tomb is located in Hazuri Bagh, the enclosed garden between the entrance of the Badshahi Mosque and the Lahore Fort, and official guards are provided by the Government of Pakistan. Iqbal is commemorated widely in Pakistan, where he is regarded as the ideological founder of the state. His Tarana-e-Hind is a song that is widely used in India as a patriotic song speaking of communal harmony. His birthday is annually commemorated in Pakistan as Iqbal Day.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: Alodia, also known as Alwa (Greek: Aρουα, Aroua; Arabic: علوة‎, ʿAlwa), was a medieval Nubian kingdom in what is now central and southern Sudan. Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administered by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \\"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization. Guess a valid title for it!

The first place I sought out was the Arizona Humane Society. It offered me a program, \\"Equestrian Therapy Program\\" ,whose mission is to build self-esteem and confidence in children who have been through difficult times in their lives. Being with animals was the only time I truly felt 1 had a place in the world. But I had never been around a horse in my life. I found myself a little apprehensive during my first day--being around such large strong animals was much harder than the three cats I'm accustomed to caring for. I found that I wasn't different during my first day around these fantastic creatures from the kids who came into the program. But there is a strange transformation when one is around horses. I found myself playing the role of student, observer, teacher, mentor, worker, friend, and companion; not only to the kids,but to the horses and staff! Before long, I was good at handling the horses and kids and having a grand time working with human and animal elements equally. I realize this experience has helped me to develop my horizons in ways I never thought likely.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that the Viola is named after? from the following article ? The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. low self-confidence is a potential cause for failure in both private life with family and friends and in professional life at work. This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"Low self-confidence is a potential cause for failure in both private life with family and friends, as well as in professional life at work. Indeed, the impact of low self-confidence on various aspects of life can be far-reaching and significant. It can lead to missed opportunities, unfulfilled potential, and a diminished sense of well-being. To understand the consequences of low self-confidence, we must first explore its definition and manifestations. Self-confidence is essentially the belief in oneself and one's abilities. It is the assurance that we can overcome challenges, reach our goals, and navigate through the uncertainties of life. When self-confidence is lacking, individuals may doubt their capabilities, avoid taking risks, and struggle to assert themselves in various situations, leading to issues in both their personal and professional lives. In personal life, low self-confidence can lead to a plethora of problems that may strain relationships with family and friends. People with low self-confidence may constantly seek reassurance and validation from others, putting a burden on their loved ones. They might also struggle with communication, be it expressing their feelings, opinions, or needs. Consequently, this can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts within relationships. Moreover, low self-confidence is often accompanied by a pervasive sense of inadequacy and an inability to derive pleasure from personal achievements. This can manifest as an unwillingness to pursue hobbies, interests, and activities that contribute to personal growth. In turn, individuals may become isolated from their social circles and develop poor self-esteem. In professional life, low self-confidence can hinder career growth and job satisfaction. Lacking confidence in one's abilities may result in a reluctance to take on new responsibilities, pursue promotions, or accept challenging projects. Additionally, people with low self-confidence may have a harder time advocating for themselves, which can lead to being overlooked for opportunities, not asking for deserved raises, or being hesitant to negotiate for better benefits. The reluctance to take risks, along with self-doubt, can hinder creativity and innovation. Employees and professionals with low self-confidence might be less willing to share their ideas, thereby missing out on potentially valuable contributions to their company or team. Furthermore, inadequate self-confidence can interfere with one's ability to work effectively in a team setting, as clear communication and trust in one's abilities are essential for successful collaboration. In conclusion, low self-confidence has the potential to cause failure in both private life with family and friends and in professional life at work. It is crucial to address and overcome self-confidence issues in order to unlock one's full potential, maintain healthy personal relationships, and navigate a successful career path. Building self-confidence may require work, but the benefits are well worth the effort."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship.

The cables holding the platform broke, and the two brothers fell all the way to the ground. Falling from such a high place can be very dangerous, and most people would not be able to survive. Sadly, Edgar did not make it. But Alcides was different - he lived through the fall! People couldn't believe it. Some thought it was a miracle, and others thought there must be a special reason he lived. Alcides was seriously hurt, though. He had to spend three weeks sleeping in a deep sleep called a coma.

Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles.

He had lived through years filled with both accomplishments and regrets, and now felt it was the time to reflect upon the choices he had made, identify patterns of behavior that led to the mistakes he wanted to avoid, and work towards self-improvement. He decided to divide the list into different categories, focusing on various aspects of his life. Some of the main themes included relationships, health, career, and personal development. Under Relationships, James began by writing down the mistakes he had made in romantic and familial relationships, as well as friendships. These included aspects such as not communicating effectively, taking people for granted, being overly reactive, holding grudges, and avoiding confrontation. He made a note to himself to focus on forgiveness, being more appreciative and supportive, and cultivating deeper connections with the people in his life. In the Health category, James listed down the unhealthy habits that had crept their way into his life over the years. These included consuming excessive sugar, not exercising consistently, neglecting mental well-being, and getting inadequate sleep. He realized that maintaining a healthy lifestyle required a commitment to making better decisions each and every day, and that even small choices could lead to significant improvements in his overall well-being. When it came to his Career, James reflected on the moments when he had chosen the path of least resistance, procrastinated on crucial projects, or burned bridges with valuable colleagues. He understood that in the pursuit of success, it was crucial to be proactive, result-oriented, and willing to face challenges head-on. To improve his work-life balance, James also noted that he needed to set boundaries and develop a stronger sense of identity outside the workplace. Finally, in the Personal Development section, James turned his focus inwards. He acknowledged the times when he had neglected self-growth, let fear and self-doubt control his actions, or allowed negativity to consume him. He vowed to cultivate a growth mindset, invest in learning new skills, explore novel experiences, and nurture a positive attitude towards life. Furthermore, he made it a point to find a hobby or passion that would give him a sense of purpose beyond his professional life. As the list grew, James began to realize the importance of not only identifying his mistakes but also learning from them to avoid repeating them in the future. Determined to become the best version of himself, he committed to making amends, developing healthier habits, and nurturing a more balanced perspective towards life. Humbled by this exercise of introspection, James became more aware of the areas he needed to work on and the actions required to make lasting, positive changes. With a newfound sense of purpose and a blueprint for self-improvement, he decided to embark on a journey of continuous growth and personal development, striving to be a better partner, friend, family member, and individual with each passing day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I know that the answer to the question \\"In what era did the Japanese government not take modernization seriously?\\" is in \\"Around the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, the Meiji era was marked by the reign of the Meiji Emperor. During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This era name means \\"Enlightened Rule\\". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period. In the 1960s younger Japanese scholars led by Irokawa Daikichi, reacted against the bureaucratic superstate, and began searching for the historic role of the common people . They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department. The samurai class suffered great disappointment the following years.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The era in which the Japanese government did not take modernization seriously was prior to the Meiji era, specifically during the Tokugawa Period (also known as the Edo Period) which lasted from 1603 to 1868. This period was characterized by a feudal society structure, with the shogunate holding centralized power and maintaining a strict isolationist policy, known as \\"sakoku.\\" Under this policy, Japan limited its interactions with the outside world, prohibiting most foreign trade and the construction of large ships that could travel long distances. As a result, Japan fell behind in terms of technological advancements and modernization compared to Western countries. However, the situation changed dramatically during the Meiji era (1868-1912), which began with the Meiji Restoration initiated in the 1860s. During this era, Japan underwent rapid modernization and adopted many Western ideas and technologies, transforming itself from a feudal society into a modern industrialized nation. The Meiji government actively pursued policies aimed at modernizing the economy, education system, military, and infrastructure, while also implementing various social and political reforms. One of the key factors that contributed to Japan's modernization during the Meiji era was the influx of Western knowledge and expertise, which was facilitated by an end to isolationist policies. Japanese leaders sent students and officials abroad to study and learn from Western countries, while also inviting foreign experts to Japan to teach and advise. This modernization process led to the development of new industries, the emergence of a capitalist economy, and the establishment of a modern bureaucracy based on meritocracy. The military was restructured according to European models, particularly those of Prussia and Britain, and Japan built a strong navy that enabled it to assert itself as a regional power. The samurai class, which had been at the forefront of Japanese society during the Tokugawa Period, experienced a decline in status as the government focused on building a national army and implementing widespread conscription. In summary, the era in which the Japanese government did not take modernization seriously was the Tokugawa Period, which preceded the Meiji era. It was during the Meiji era that Japan embraced modernization and successfully transformed itself into a powerful and industrialized nation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The experienced columnists and reporters at USA TODAY give you the news you need and advice you trust. SIGN UP NOW. IT'S FREE By Christine Dugas, USA TODAY When pop music legend Michael Jackson died at age 50, he left behind three young children, millions of dollars of debt and assets that may be worth more than 1 billion. He also left behind a five-page will written in 2002 that named a guardian for his children and executors to sort out his vast and complicated estate. We all should take such care, but survey after survey has shown that the majority of us do not. \\"The reason why people don't do wills is probably just some sense of immortality,\\" says Sally Hurme, an attorney and senior project manager for AARP. Wills and estate planning don't have to be complicated, and for the vast majority of us, they're not and can be done relatively cheaply and conveniently — even at home. In general, everyone needs a will. Living wills, powers of attorney and doctor authorizations should be established, too, but the focus here is narrower: end-of-life planning. Succession laws vary by state and circumstance, which is why having a will is a good idea. If you don't control what happens to your property, children, favorite piece of jewelry and so forth, the state will. And that can lead to imperfect and sometimes costly decisions in probate court, which is where the distribution of a person's estate occurs. Parents of young children should have a will for one major reason: to establish a guardian. A trustee also should be named to manage money or any property left for young children. If parents change their minds over time about guardians, it's easy to change or destroy an original will and write a new one. If you're an unmarried couple with or without children, a will is also quite important. Under most states' laws, if one partner dies without a will, it's as if the other partner doesn't exist. \\"Your partner would get nothing,\\" says Mary Randolph, an attorney at Nolo Press, publisher of self-help legal guides and software. \\"It would go to your parents or possibly to your siblings.\\" Someone who has set up a joint bank account, joint homeownership and designated beneficiaries for benefits such as 401(k) plans and life insurance can be fairly well assured that a common-sense succession will occur even without a will. But there are costs to probate court and little tax protection. And if you have personal items and mementos, such as jewelry, china or art, that you want to bequeath to a close friend, certain relatives or charity, that is only going to happen if specified in a will or trust. If your estate is large or complicated, you may also want to set up a living trust. A living trust will help your heirs avoid probate, the complex and sometimes costly process by which a state court distributes your assets. Not everyone needs a trust: Many states exempt a certain amount of assets from probate or offer expedited procedures for small estates. Discord is not uncommon in families. While there is not much you can do to prevent squabbles, you can reduce chances that disputes over your will end up in a bitter court battle. For example, if you don't plan to provide your children equal assets, you may want to explain your reasoning in person. \\"I've had some cases where we've had a family council,\\" says Donna Bashaw, an elder-law attorney in Laguna Hills, Calif. She says that one client wanted to leave more money to his daughter, who was divorced and struggling, than his son, who was a successful professional. If there is a family member whom you want to disinherit, it still may be wise to leave him small assets. It may be less likely that he will dispute the will. Some people establish challenge provisions. If someone challenges the will in court and loses, he or she forfeits whatever was left to them in the first place. Some common errors to avoid: •Lack of signatures. A will must be properly signed and witnessed, with witnesses in the same room. If not, the will can be contested. •The will can't be found. A will needs to be stored in an accessible place. Some put them into a safe-deposit box. \\"The problem is that the executor may not be able to get to it after your death,\\" Randolph says. One suggestion is to keep it at home in a fireproof box with other important papers, Randolph says. •Multiple copies. You may want to provide your executor with a copy of your will. But if you change it, you should be sure to destroy any original copies. •Lack of specifics. Some people simply state they wish to leave their entire estate to their children. But all names should be listed so it is clear whether adopted or stepchildren should be included, for example. •Choosing the wrong executor. Relatives and friends are not necessarily the best trustees or executors. The right executor is someone who can be trusted, who can work well with others, who is intelligent and who is not afraid to ask for — or hire — help. Do you need a lawyer? An attorney specializing in estate planning can be helpful but is not always necessary. Several companies offer software and online programs for do-it-yourself wills. Among the programs are Nolo's Quicken WillMaker Plus 2009 and Kiplinger's WillPower. Do-it-yourself wills are less costly than hiring a lawyer and are options for uncomplicated estates. Care must be taken, though. If you do decide to pay for a lawyer to write your will, you should educate yourself in advance so you can converse intelligently. \\"You don't want to pay them to educate you,\\" Randolph says.

Hypothesis: Pepperoni and cheese pizza was eaten for lunch. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To evaluate if the premise entails the hypothesis, we must start by understanding the two statements and their relationship. Premise: The steak and chips partaken of for lunch seemed now to belong to another decade. This statement is a subjective experience of someone who consumed steak and chips for lunch and now feels like that experience belongs to another decade, either due to the time or other factors. The main information provided in this premise is that the person had steak and chips for lunch. Hypothesis: Pepperoni and cheese pizza was eaten for lunch. This statement introduces an entirely different scenario where a pepperoni and cheese pizza was consumed for lunch. The hypothesis proposes a different meal (pizza) compared to the premise (steak and chips). Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another statement. In this case, we must determine if the truth of the premise will necessarily lead to the truth of the hypothesis. Having steak and chips for lunch (premise) does not automatically lead to the conclusion that a pepperoni and cheese pizza was eaten for lunch (hypothesis). These are two distinct meals, and they cannot both be true within the same situation. It is also possible that both of these meals were consumed in separate instances or by different people, but the information provided in the premise and hypothesis do not suggest this. Thus, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The only connection between the two statements is that they both involve lunchtime meals, but this connection alone does not guarantee that the truth of the premise would lead to the truth of the hypothesis. They represent two different situations and meals, and as such, entailment cannot be established."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In a move that surprised many, the Vice President made it clear that they do not believe a conference is currently the best solution for achieving sustainable development and fostering unity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For several years, Bosnia and Herzegovina has faced growing internal challenges ranging from lingering ethnic divisions to bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption. Analysts have often called for a review of the Dayton Agreement of 1995, which put an end to the Bosnian War but left behind a complicated and often ineffective power-sharing system between the three major ethnic groups in the country: Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats. Amidst these concerns, some believe that an international conference could help showcase the nation's progress since the 1990s and enable the country to refocus its efforts on critical issues that hinder its path to development. Advocates for the conference have argued that input from external experts, along with Bosnian decision-makers, could provide valuable insights on tackling pressing issues such as economic stagnation, high unemployment rates, and infrastructure development. However, the Bosnian Vice President's recent dismissal of the conference proposal suggests an alternative path towards resolving these problems. In the statement, the Vice President emphasized the importance of finding \\"homegrown solutions and relying on the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\" They argued that an international conference could be perceived as external interference in the nation's affairs, which may not be received well by all parties involved. The Vice President also highlighted that Bosnia and Herzegovina has made significant strides in recent years, in spite of its numerous challenges. The statement underscored the progress achieved in establishing more transparent governance structures, reducing corruption, and streamlining administrative processes. While acknowledging that much more needs to be done, the Vice President maintained confidence in the ability of the Bosnian people to strengthen their society and institutions. The rejection of the conference idea has prompted various reactions from both domestic and international stakeholders. Some have criticized the Vice President's position as a denial of valuable opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing, while others have applauded the emphasis on self-reliance and the nurturing of local expertise. In the coming weeks, it remains to be seen how the government and the public will react to this statement and whether the momentum behind the conference proposal will continue to gather steam. As Bosnia and Herzegovina works to resolve its longstanding issues, the delicate balance between seeking external assistance and relying on internal resources will undoubtedly be at the forefront of the political conversation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If your legs are swollen or you have been sitting for a long time as in a overseas plane ride, blood clots can form and spread to your lung arteries, causing blockage. Lung conditions cause chest pain that can worsen when you breathe, move, or cough. Get to an emergency room as quickly as possible. Lung conditions may require emergency surgery to alleviate symptoms. Pneumonia is an infection that affects the air sacs in the lungs. They become inflamed, and can fill with fluid, which results in the phlegm and mucus you see when you cough. The chest pain you experience may be accompanied by: Fever Coughing up mucus or phlegm Fatigue Nausea, and vomiting In mild cases, you can simply rest at home and wait for your immune system to fight off the infection. But if the infection grows severe it can become life-threatening, especially in children and the elderly. See your doctor if: You have trouble breathing The chest pain worsens significantly You have a fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher that won't go down Your coughing won't subside, especially if you're coughing up pus Be especially careful with children under two, adults over 65, and anyone else with a compromised immune system. If a bacterial infection has caused the pneumonia, the doctor can prescribe antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin) to fight the infection and speed up recovery. However, even if antibiotic treatment is not an option for your infection, he can still give you medication to deal with the chest pain or reduce the coughing that worsens the pain. A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blockage develops in a lung (pulmonary) artery. Pneumothorax (collapsed lung) occurs when air leaks into the space between your lungs and your chest wall. Both conditions cause severe shortness of breath or a bluish discoloration of the fingers and mouth. In delicate patients such as the elderly or long-term asthma sufferers, the intense coughing from pneumonia can sometimes cause a lung blockage or tear in the lung. If you suspect a pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax, then seek immediate medical attention. In addition to chest pain, both conditions cause severe shortness of breath or a bluish discoloration of the fingers and mouth. Both conditions require immediate medical attention. The blood leaking into the chest cavity or the air escaping into it can rapidly collect and compress your lungs. These conditions will not resolve on their own, but require medical assistance.

By lowing her blood pressure and stopping her heart from beating.. d). By draining her blood, lowering her blood pressure and stopping her breathing.. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Death is natural, but do you have any idea of the process of dying? Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two phases --- clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived . Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the \\"breaking up\\" of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final. Scientists have been seeking a way to prolong the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death. To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery. The monkey's blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta's heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head. After six hours, when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection, Keta seized the syringe and ran with it around the room. Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal.

This conclusion is drawn from the following facts within the paragraph: 1. Robert Blanchard was born on November 5, 1968. 2. He played a total of eight years in the National Football League (NFL). 3. He played with the New York Jets for his first two years. Considering Robert was born in 1968 and played in the NFL for eight years, with the first two years spent with the New York Jets, we can calculate the starting year of his NFL career by determining the difference of his age minus the total years he played: 1991 - 1968 = 23 years old → This would mean that Robert would have been 23 years old when he began his NFL career. Based on the fact that he first played for New York Jets and then took 1994 off, we are given enough timeline information to deduce that his career indeed began in 1991: 1991-1992: New York Jets 1994: Took the year off 1995-1997: Indianapolis Colts 1998: Washington Redskins 1999: New York Giants 2000: Arizona Cardinals Adding up these years, we get a total of eight years, which aligns with the information provided.

She is a fan of the daytime soap opera 'A Reason to Love'. She has no idea that her sneaky husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), a car salesman, is having an affair with his secretary and that he intends to leave Betty in order to pursue a relationship with the secretary. She also doesn't know that her husband supplements his income by selling drugs out of the car dealership.When Betty calls to leave a message about borrowing a Buick LeSabre for her birthday, her husband tells Betty to take a different car as the LeSabre has stolen drugs hidden in the trunk.Two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock) show up at the house with Betty's husband. The hitmen torture Del into revealing that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of a car but are not successful in getting him to tell which car it is. Betty witnesses the murder and experiences a fugue state, escaping the reality of murder into the comforting fantasy of the soap opera. In her mind, she assumes the identity of one of the characters in the daytime drama, a nurse.That evening, Sheriff Ballard (Pruit Taylor Vance), Roy Ostery (Crispin Glover) a local reporter, and the police are examining the crime scene while Betty calmly packs a suitcase.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the water leaking out happens, how will it affect the water levels increasing. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case states that there is water leaking out during the coffee-making process. Let's analyze the process step-by-step to understand the effect of this perturbation on the process. Step 1: The carafe is filled with water - If the water is leaking out during this step, the user may not pour the desired amount of water into the machine. This could result in a lower water level, possibly affecting the taste and strength of the coffee made. Step 2: The water is poured into the machine at the back - If the water is leaking out during this step, the water level inside the machine will be lower than expected, which will affect the overall coffee brewing process and result in weaker coffee or potentially even not brewing a full pot. Step 3-6: Coffee beans, grinder, filter, and ground coffee addition - The water leaking perturbation has no direct effect on these steps as they involve preparation of coffee grounds. Step 7: Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - While the water leaking wouldn't directly affect this step, the altered water levels might affect how the salt interacts with the ground coffee during the brewing process, potentially changing the flavor profile of the final coffee. Step 8: Closing the top of the machine - This step isn't directly affected by the water leaking perturbation. Step 9: The power is turned on - Turning the power on will initiate the brewing process. If the water level is too low due to leakage, the machine may not function as intended, resulting in weaker coffee or potentially a machine malfunction. Step 10: The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee - If there is water leaking, the water level will be lower, and it will lead to less water passing through the grounds, possibly yielding a smaller volume of brewed coffee or a weaker coffee taste due to less water interacting with the coffee grounds. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation does have both direct and indirect effects on the overall coffee-making process. A water leak would directly affect the water levels in the machine, which in turn could alter the taste, strength, and volume of the brewed coffee. The indirect effects include potential changes in how other ingredients, such as salt, interact with the ground coffee during brewing – again affecting the flavor profile."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Great egrets mainly feed on fish, frogs, small mammals, and aquatic insects. They are wading birds that tend to live in wetland areas, which provide a rich food supply.

She managed to whisper the word \\"bear\\" to her rescuer. The girl suffered serious head, neck and leg wounds. Now she is in a dangerous condition in hospital. The girl was taking part in a 24-hour race through Bicentennial Park in Alaska when she was attacked by the bear. Bicentennial Park is next to Chugach State Park where some wild animals live. The animal attacked the girl in a heavily wooded area at about 1:30 am. The girl called emergency services but she was unable to say any word. Another rider Peter Basinger found her lying unconscious on the ground. He told the Anchorage Daily News that she managed to say the word \\"bear\\" when he stopped to help. Her helmet had been ripped off in the attack and rolled into the woods. Mr. Basinger waited with the girl for about 20 minutes until doctors arrived. Armed police trekked 3 km with doctors to pick up the girl. Animal expert Rick Sinnott said something must be done as soon as possible to prevent the bear from attacking people again. \\"It was extremely terrifying,\\" he said. Mr. Sinnott told the Anchorage Daily News that the bear might be a mother. It hurt two runners on a nearby path two weeks ago. He also said that the girl was lucky to have been wearing a bike helmet because the bear had bitten her head several times. Question: Mr. Sinnott said the girl was lucky because _ .

Pendragon Pictures' new film \\"H G Wells' War of the Worlds\\", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years. A theatrical release was intended for earlier this year (March, 2005) but this never happened. The DVD was rushed out to coincide with the release of Spielberg's version, which hits theatres June 29. I liked this film, with certain reservations. How faithful is the adaptation? It's not quite 100% faithful to Wells' book, but 90 - 95% faithful is good enough for me. At least several scenes were totally new, such as Ogilvy the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the unnamed writer/narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin. But on the whole, this film follows the book very closely -- certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by George Pal. Its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget. The majority of it seems to have been shot blue-screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds. This is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots, and scenes of crowded city streets. The overviews of 1898 London look like something from a video game. Numerous scenes in horse-carriages were faked -- I guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse. The only scenes shot for \\"real\\" seem to be those in open fields or forests. But within those budget restrictions, they managed to do quite a lot. Artistically, the film looks right. The Martians and their tripods are quite well done, and very true to Wells' descriptions. I was particularly impressed with the heat ray. Although the Thunder Child sequence, which should have been one of the film's highlights, is very disappointing. It's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets, or better quality animation. The acting and direction won't win any Oscars. For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. The music is quite good also, though not on a par with any of the major Hollywood composers. I'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release, because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen. As it stands, I would rate this similarly to a BBC-TV adaptation of classic literature. A few nitpicks: Most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters (mostly red). This may have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently, and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the DVD. And the writer/narrator's obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene. Bottom line -- Is it worth seeing? If you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations, and get into the story, I think you will enjoy this, especially if you've actually read the original H G Wells novel. If, however, you are easily put off by cheap production values, you'd best pass on this (unless you're a MST3K fan). Be warned, however that the film runs a full 3 hours, so I don't recommend watching it all in one sitting. BTW: An entirely different version of War of the Worlds (aka \\"INVASION\\") came out on DVD the same month that Spielberg's hit the theatres: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. This was also made on a budget, but is updated to the present day like the Spielberg film - but it's much better!

Review: I was really looking forward to this but unfortunately I agree with the reviews I have read of this DVD. I saw this concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London in May 2000. I had never seen him before but it was fantastic and Sting at his very best. The DVD disappoints because the stereo soundtrack has been created direct from the mixing desk without any effects, particularly on Stings vocals. As much as I love his and Cheb Mami's voice on Desert Rose, they are far too loud in the mix and make it near impossible to enjoy. I would love to see Ten Summoners Tales on DVD which was a film recorded during the recording of that album at Sting's home in England. Or Bring on the Night, or his previous music videos - please...there has been so much better than this from Sting. Is the review positive or negative?

Article: During the 19th century, scientists found that when certain parts of the brain of a person were hurt, he would lose the power of doing certain things. And so people thought that each part of the brain does a different job. But modern research has discovered that this is not so, for it is not easy to show exactly what each part of the brain does. In the past fifty years there has been a great increase in the amount or research done on the brain. Scientists have found out that the way the brain works is not so simple as people in general may think. Chemists tell us that about 100,000 chemical changes take place in the brain every second. Some recent researches also suggest that we can remember everything that happened to us. We may not be able to think of the things we have heard and seen but it is kept there in the store-house of the human mind. Earlier scientists thought that the power of one's brain got weaker and weaker as one grows older. But it is plenty of exercise, it keeps its power. It is now thought that is not true. As long as the brain is given plenty of exercise, it keeps its power. It has proved that an old person who has always been active in the mind has a quicker mind than a young person who has done physical work without using much of his brain.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"In order to determine whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true, let's break down the meaning behind each sentence. Sentence 1: \\"What are you trying to suggest?\\" This sentence is a question, which implies that the speaker believes the person they are addressing is trying to imply or communicate something indirectly. It's an inquiry seeking clarification about the intended meaning or suggestion of the other person. Sentence 2: \\"You are attempting to suggest something.\\" This sentence is a statement asserting that the person being addressed is indeed trying to imply or communicate something indirectly. Rather than seeking clarification like Sentence 1, Sentence 2 is making a declarative statement about the situation. Now, let's consider the condition \\"If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\" The truth value of Sentence 1 depends on whether or not the person being addressed is indeed trying to suggest something. Since it's a question, it cannot be definitively said to be true or false on its own. However, it does express an assumption that might be true or false (i.e. that the person being addressed is trying to suggest something). Thus, we need to evaluate the assumption underlying Sentence 1 in order to find its truth value and consequently determine the truth value of Sentence 2. If the assumption within Sentence 1 (that the person is trying to suggest something) is indeed true, then that would naturally make Sentence 2 true as well, because Sentence 2 is directly stating that the person is attempting to suggest something. In this scenario, both sentences are aligned in terms of their underlying assumptions. However, if the assumption within Sentence 1 turns out to be false (i.e., the person is NOT trying to suggest something), Sentence 1 would still remain a question, but not a true representation of the situation. In this case, Sentence 2 would also be false, because it asserts the incorrect assumption from Sentence 1. In conclusion, if the underlying assumption of Sentence 1 is true (i.e. the person is trying to suggest something), then Sentence 2 would also be true. While dealing with questions can be complex in terms of truth value, the conditional nature of the provided statement allows us to identify that the truth values for both sentences are consistent based on their shared assumption."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

French deficit rose in 2014, with heavy borrowing a feature of 2015 budget. Article:","completion":"Title: The Big Bank and the Fragile House: A Tale of Money Talk Once upon a time, in a land far, far away called the European Union, there was a group of big, big countries. Each country had its own little money box. Inside the money box, they kept all their gold coins they earned by selling apples, cars, pastries, and so many other things. They were happy when they had a lot of coins in their boxes. The European Union had a big rule book. One important rule was about borrowing. It said that a country could only borrow a certain number of coins to avoid having an empty money box. If they borrowed too much, they might not be able to give back the coins on time. That's like always eating candies non-stop. Initially, it's fun, but if you eat too many, you could have a tummy ache. Germany's boss - we call her a chancellor - is a smart lady named Merkel. She saw that some countries were not following the borrow rule. She worried and said, \\"Careful, friends! Our big European house is still built of glass and could break\\". She meant that their economy was in a delicate situation. You see, borrowing more coins could lead to big trouble. Now, let's talk about France. France promised earlier that they would control how much they would borrow. They wouldn't eat too many candies. But guess what? They not only ate more candies but also borrowed more. In the year 2014, France’s money box had very few coins. And in 2015, they said -\\"we might need to borrow even more coins.\\" Merkel's worry was about being careful and respecting the borrow rule. She didn’t want anyone to have an empty money box. It was like a delicate game of balancing the coins without toppling them over. Let's hope everyone understands the importance of not eating too many candies and keeping the glass house safe.

Step 2: Analyzing Question 2 \\"What is the best possible solution of the Kashmir issue?\\" This question aims to identify the most optimal resolution to the Kashmir dispute, without specifying whether it should be political or any other type.

Alex is full of life and more interested in playing the fool, by dancing around and doing the \\"happy face/angry face\\" gag with his paw. Zuba shows him his paw, which has an Africa-shaped birthmark on it, which Alex also has on his paw. Just then, Makunga (Alec Baldwin), a scheming lion who wants to be Alpha Lion, challenges Zuba. Leaving Alex alone for a while, Zuba kicks the pride out of Makunga. As the fight is going on, Alex notices a piece of rope moving on the ground and follows it. He goes off the reserve and is captured by poachers, who dump him in a crate and put him in the bed of their truck. Zuba notices that his son is missing. He sees the truck moving along the fence of the reserve and hears his son, crying out for help. He runs and jumps on the truck. He manages to free the crate of its binds, when one of the poachers shoots him, causing him to fall off the truck. He doesn't notice that Alex's crate has fallen out of the truck-bed and into a nearby river. Despite the painful hole in his ear, he mourns the loss of his son.Meanwhile, in the box, Alex sits timidly. Finally, he reaches New York City and is fished out and put in the New York City Zoo.

In contrast to the timid Mary, Paulie is full of life. For example, at Mary's very first day at the school during a quiet afternoon party on the campus thrown by the staff as a welcome back gathering, Paulie turns the events into a loud music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor. In an effort to break Mary out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When Mary's roommates learn that her mother recently died, Paulie nicknames her \\"Mary Brave\\". Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing men, but she soon realises the nature of their romance. This also manifests itself in Paulie coming to Tori's rescue. For example, Paulie defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who unintentionally humiliates her when she does not understand a mathematical equation.

Premise: \\"Ribeiro Frio is relaxing, but the real reason for its popularity are two walks that begin here.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Ribeiro Frio is popular because of the two walks that start here.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it can be reasonably inferred that the hypothesis \\"Ribeiro Frio is popular because of the two walks that start here\\" is true. To better understand this conclusion, let's take a deeper look at the premise, the components within it, and the areas surrounding Ribeiro Frio. The premise states that Ribeiro Frio is a relaxing place; this description suggests that it is an appealing destination for visitors looking for a peaceful and serene environment. However, the premise also highlights that the primary reason behind Ribeiro Frio's popularity is the two walks that begin in this location. This assertion implies that while relaxation might play a role in attracting people to the area, it's the presence of these walking trails that primarily contribute to Ribeiro Frio's popularity. Ribeiro Frio, which translates to \\"Cold River,\\" is a small village located in the heart of Madeira Island, Portugal. It is renowned for its natural beauty and is surrounded by lush forests, making it an attractive destination for nature enthusiasts. In addition to its picturesque landscape, Madeira Island is well-known for its levada walks – a network of mini-canals and accompanying footpaths that traverse the island's diverse terrains, allowing walkers to experience the region's breathtaking sceneries. It is in Ribeiro Frio that two of Madeira's most famous levada walks commence: 1. Levada walk to Balcoes viewpoint (Levada dos Balcoes): This relatively short and easy walk (approximately 1.5 kilometers) follows the peaceful Levada dos Balcoes through the endemic Laurissilva forest and culminates at a viewing platform that offers stunning panoramic views of the island's central mountain range. 2. Levada walk to Portela (Levada do Furado): This trail is longer and more challenging, spanning about 11 kilometers. It starts in Ribeiro Frio and winds through beautiful forests, passing by waterfalls and crossing tunnels, before ultimately reaching the village of Portela. The journey showcases Madeira's diverse landscapes and is popular among more experienced walkers. Given that these two walks are well-known attractions on Madeira Island and they both start in Ribeiro Frio, it can be confidently stated that these trails play a significant role in Ribeiro Frio's popularity. As a result, the hypothesis \\"Ribeiro Frio is popular because of the two walks that start here\\" aligns with the premise and can be considered true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: CENTENNIAL — Prosecutors presented video of terrified moviegoers, laid out where police recovered bodies and explained in precise detail how each of the 12 slain victims died during a grim first day of theater-shooting suspect James Holmes' preliminary hearing. Testimony on Monday painted a picture of pandemonium, where blood-drenched people screamed for help and police officers raced against time to save survivors. While police choked up on the stand recounting the day, the accused sat bushy-bearded at the defense table showing no emotion. Coroners testified that 33 rounds — a mix of single bullets and shotgun blasts — were used to kill the 12 slain victims. Four struck 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan. In signs of an anticipated insanity defense, prosecutors and the defense fought to frame Holmes' state of mind during and immediately after the July 20 shooting, pitting images of a determined shooter against someone disconnected from his surroundings. Surveillance video from the lobby of the Century Aurora 16 theater shows Holmes hiding his dyed-red hair beneath a dark stocking cap. He had purchased his ticket for the midnight showing July 8. Police recovered 209 live AR-15 rounds and 15 live 40-caliber handgun rounds from the scene, testified Detective Matthew Ingui. The gunman was \\"very calm and moving with purpose,\\" one victim told Ingui. Officers from all points rushed to the scene, at first mistaking the man in the gas mask and body armor for one of their own. From atop an elevated garage, Sgt. Gerald Jonsgaard scouted the back of the theater, where he spotted Holmes. \\"My first thought was, 'How did that SWAT guy get here so quick?' \\" Jonsgaard testified. For a few brief moments, he held Holmes in his cross hairs. At the same time, Officer Jason Oviatt realized he had made a similar mistake. Holmes was \\"just standing there,\\" Oviatt testified. \\"Not doing anything. Not in any hurry. Not excited.\\" Oviatt and the other officers paint a nuanced picture of his state of mind — details attorneys homed in on. At one point, defense attorney Daniel King pointed out that Oviatt had observed Holmes dripping with sweat. Chief Deputy District Attorney Karen Pearson quickly pointed out that anyone wearing body armor would likely be sweating. Oviatt's reports from that day note Holmes \\"simply stared off into the distance\\" and \\"seemed to be out of it and disoriented.\\" On the stand, Oviatt said Holmes was \\"very, very relaxed\\" and showed no normal emotional responses but understood directions and cooperated. Oviatt testified he saw no signs of drug use, despite noting in reports that Holmes' pupils were \\"huge.\\" Officer Justin Grizzle remembered asking Holmes if he had a partner in the shooting shortly afterward and receiving an enigmatic response. \\"He just looked at me and smiled,\\" Grizzle said. ||||| The families of victims last year's mass shooting at a Colorado theater shooting sat through emotional testimony Monday from police officers who tried to save the lives of the wounded.

(Associated Press) Family members and victims line up to get into court for a preliminary hearing for Aurora theater shooting suspect james Holmes at the courthouse in Centennial, Colo., on Monday, Jan. 7, 2013. Holmes... (Associated Press) One sergeant recalled during the hearing for suspected gunman James Holmes that he checked and did not find a pulse for the youngest victim, 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan. Another who drove the wounded to the hospital said he had to stop one man worried about his 7-year-old daughter from jumping out of the moving patrol car. A bearded Holmes didn't appear to show any emotion. One woman sat with her head buried in her hands during the testimony about Veronica. The police officer who arrested the suspected gunman said he first thought James Holmes was a fellow officer because he was wearing body armor. Then the officer realized he was wrong because Holmes wasn't running toward the scene. The first extensive details were emerging about the young man suspected of killing 12 people and wounding at least 58 in one of the worst mass shootings in the U.S. last year. The hearing will determine whether the case will go to trial. Holmes is charged with more than 160 counts, including murder and attempted murder. Investigators say he was wearing a gas mask, in addition to the body armor, when he tossed two gas canisters and opened fire in the theater on July 20. As soon as Officer Jason Oviatt saw Holmes outside the theater and realized that he wasn't a fellow officer, he pointed his gun at Holmes, handcuffed him and searched him. Oviatt said he found two knives and a semi-automatic handgun on top of Holmes' car. The officer said an ammunition round fell out of Holmes' pocket, and he found another one on the ground. Police officers who arrested Holmes described him as unusually relaxed but fidgety at times. They said he told them that his apartment had been booby trapped. Holmes didn't seem to have \\"normal emotional reactions\\" to things, Oviatt said. \\"He seemed very detached from it all,\\" he said. Until now, many details of the case have been kept quiet. Three days after the shooting, District Judge William Sylvester forbade attorneys and investigators from discussing the case publicly, and many court documents have been filed under seal. Police say Holmes, now 25, had stockpiled weapons, ammunition and explosives. He was a first-year student in a Ph.D. neuroscience program at the University of Colorado, Denver, but he failed a year-end exam and withdrew, authorities have said. The shootings came six weeks later. Federal authorities have said Holmes entered the theater with a ticket and is believed to have propped open a door, slipped out to his car and returned with his weapons. Police arrested him outside the theater shortly after the shootings ended. Legal analysts said that evidence appears to be so strong that Holmes may accept a plea agreement before trial. In general, plea agreements help prosecutors avoid costly trials, give the accused a lesser sentence like life in prison rather than the death penalty and spare the victims and their families from the trauma of going through a lengthy trial. Holmes' mental health could be a significant issue in the hearing. His attorneys have told the judge Holmes is mentally ill, but they have not said whether they plan to employ an insanity defense. He had seen a university psychiatrist, and his lawyers have said he tried to call the psychiatrist nine minutes before the killing began. Defense lawyers have said they plan to call at least two witnesses who could testify about Holmes' mental health. Prosecutors asked the judge to block the witnesses, but he refused. Lawyers have been debating what physical evidence should be made available, whether a psychiatrist who met with Holmes is barred from testimony by doctor-patient privilege and other issues. ___ Associated Press writer Dan Elliott contributed. ||||| Summary:","completion":"During the first day of the preliminary hearing for theater-shooting suspect James Holmes, prosecutors presented a harrowing account of the events that took place on July 20, 2012. Video footage of terrified moviegoers, the locations where bodies were recovered, and coroner's testimony regarding the 12 victims' deaths were shown. Police officers provided emotional testimony about the pandemonium that ensued, with people screaming for help as officers raced to save survivors. Holmes, who appeared in court with a bushy beard, showed no emotion throughout the proceedings. The hearing also presented details about Holmes' calm demeanor during and immediately after the shooting, as both the prosecution and defense attempted to frame his state of mind, possibly laying the groundwork for an anticipated insanity defense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

BACKGROUND Although Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) is involved in monocyte activation in patients with accelerated forms of atherosclerosis, the relationship between the expression of TLR-4 on circulating monocytes and coronary plaque vulnerability has not previously been evaluated. We investigated this relationship using 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP).Methods and Results:We enrolled 65 patients with SAP who underwent MDCT. Three monocyte subsets (CD14++CD16-, CD14++CD16+, and CD14+CD16+) and expression of TLR-4 were measured by flow cytometry. Intracoronary plaques were assessed by 64-slice MDCT. We defined vulnerability of intracoronary plaques according to the presence of positive remodeling (remodeling index >1.05) and/or low CT attenuation (<35 HU). The circulating CD14++CD16+monocytes more frequently expressed TLR-4 than CD14++CD16-and CD14+CD16+monocytes (P<0.001). The relative proportion of the expression of TLR-4 on CD14++CD16+monocytes was significantly greater in patients with vulnerable plaque compared with those without (10.4 [4.1-14.5] % vs. 4.5 [2.8-7.8] %, P=0.012). In addition, the relative proportion of TLR-4 expression on CD14++CD16+monocytes positively correlated with the remodeling index (r=0.28, P=0.025) and negatively correlated with CT attenuation value (r=-0.31, P=0.013). CONCLUSIONS Upregulation of TLR-4 on CD14++CD16+monocytes might be associated with coronary plaque vulnerability in patients with SAP.","completion":"Task: Determine if the given abstract is structured or not by analyzing its composition and generating a label \\"True\\" if it is structured, and \\"False\\" if it is not.

Self-reported scores for foot function (Achilles tendon rupture score) and level of physical activity were collected. Twenty age- and sex-matched controls were assessed in the same manner.', 'Physical examination of patients with the knee extended revealed 11.1° of dorsiflexion on the injured side and 9.2° on the uninjured side (P = .020), indicating gastrocnemius muscle lengthening. The 1-legged jump distance was shorter on the injured side (89.5 vs 96.2 cm; P < .001). Gait analysis showed higher peak dorsiflexion (14.3° vs 13.3°; P = .016) and lower concentric (positive) plantar flexor work (16.6 vs 19.9 J/kg; P = .001) in the ankle on the uninjured side.

He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which crop would be less beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B? Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.

Newborn baby dies, creating triple tragedy after late-night Brooklyn hit-and-run kills expecting parents The tiniest victim of a hit-and-run that wiped out a young Brooklyn family was laid to rest Monday, as cops hunted for the heartless driver — an ex-con who was busted for drunken driving about two weeks ago. Julio Acevedo, the subject of the police dragnet, has a long rap sheet, including an eight-year stretch in prison for shooting a man to death in Brooklyn in 1987. Police believe the violent felon was behind the wheel of a BMW that barreled down Kent Ave. in Brooklyn early Sunday at more than 60 mph — twice the speed limit. The flashy ride T-boned a livery cab that was carrying an expectant couple to a hospital about 12:30 a.m. Nachman and Raizel Glauber, who was seven months pregnant with their first child and was experiencing pains that night, did not survive the wreck. But doctors at Bellevue Hospital were able to deliver their baby boy. The newborn, who weighed less than 3 pounds, died about 5 a.m. Monday — snuffing out the only ray of hope to emerge from the couple’s terrible fate. The boy, to be named after his father, was buried with little fanfare near the fresh graves of his Orthodox Jewish parents in a cemetery in Kiryas Joel, Orange County. The cause of death for the infant was extreme prematurity due to blunt-force trauma to the mother, the medical examiner said. Joseph Silberstein, Raizel Glauber’s brother, spoke on behalf of the family in the hallway of their Clymer St. building. He said he laid eyes on his tragic nephew before his brief life ended. “I’d rather not get into it,” Silberstein said. “I can’t. This was God’s will. We accept it.” Silberstein said the suspect who ran from the scene can’t imagine the tragedy he left behind. “Whoever did not go through this can’t even contemplate what this is, to lose a sister and her husband . . . and more, at once, so suddenly.” Relatives and a friend of Acevedo, 44, said the cowardly driver was trying to get his hands on some cash to hire a lawyer. Then he was planning to surrender. “He’s willing to cop out to whatever it is. He’s admitting his responsibility,” said his pal, Derrick Hamilton. The suspect has quite a tale. Acevedo told friends he was out for a joyride through a residential part of Williamsburg when he spotted an old nemesis. The rival began chasing him and Acevedo slammed his foot down on the gas, and soon after smashed into the young couple’s livery car near Wilson St. The Glaubers, both 21, weren’t wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash, cops said. The cab driver, Pedro Nunez, survived with minor injuries. Acevedo’s mother, who lives in Brooklyn, said she has no contact with her estranged son. “I know why you are here. You are here for my son. He doesn’t live here,” the sobbing woman said from inside her apartment at the Farragut Houses. She refused to give her name or open the door. “I don’t want to talk. I have nothing to say. Tell the family of my condolences,” the distraught woman said, weeping on the other side of the door. The felon’s mother said her niece told her about the hit-and-run tragedy. She also expects her son to turn himself in. “He doesn’t call me. I didn’t raise him,” she added. l The career criminal had a 0.13 blood-alcohol content after a DWI bust on Feb. 17 in Brooklyn, authorities said. The legal limit in New York is 0.08. Acevedo had come from a baby shower at the Sugar Hill Club in Bedford-Stuyvesant when he was pulled over for driving erratically, authorities said. The bad seed told cops he had a couple of beers. He was arrested on Lafayette Ave. about 3:15 a.m. Court records show he was in a BMW during that bust, too — but not the same one involved in Sunday’s wreck. Cops said Acevedo was slurring his words and had red eyes and alcohol on his breath. That case is pending; he’s due back in court April 10. l Grief-stricken relatives and friends of the Glaubers crowded into the couple’s Williamsburg apartment on Monday to sit shiva — a day after at least 1,000 people mourned the couple at a funeral outside the Hasidic Congregation Yetev Lev D’Satmar. Retired printer Oscar Sabel, who lives near the scene of the crash, said the mood in the close-knit neighborhood was one of despair. “We all hoped the baby would survive,” he said. l Takia Walker, 29, who owned the BMW that plowed into the Glaubers, has been charged in the Bronx with insurance fraud. She was released from custody on Monday. “Prosecution has been deferred pending further investigation,” said a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney’s office. Police initially suspected the car was purchased and registered under false pretenses. But Walker, who called the Daily News Monday from police custody, said the BMW was legally hers. “I let my friend borrow my car. I don’t know what happened from that point,” she said. “I woke up with the police picking me up.” She said she gave the car to a friend named Twana on Friday morning. The friend was supposed to go to the airport, park the BMW there and return it Monday. “I have no clue (why) there was a man driving the car,” said Walker, mother to a year-old child. l Police have offered a 2,000 reward for information leading them to Acevedo’s whereabouts. Anyone with information should call (800) 577-TIPS. Two City Council members and members of the Orthodox Jewish community also offered awards totaling 15,000. l Acevedo will likely be charged with leaving the scene of an accident. He could be charged with vehicular homicide or vehicular manslaughter if prosecutors can prove he was intoxicated, said defense attorney Todd Greenberg, who specializes in vehicular law. Second-degree manslaughter carries a 15-year sentence. l Greenberg said some prosecutors have filed charges of depraved-indifference murder, which carries a life sentence, in cases where the driver’s conduct before the crash was particularly egregious. But it’s too early to tell if that would apply in this case.

Article: The next time you look up at the sky and see a cloud that looks like Mickey Mouse or your favorite fruit, look again. It may not be a cloud, but a Flogo -- a logo that flies. It's a new form of advertising in the sky that's never been used before. It's a different way to market your products, logos, and events. These funny logos are made with soap bubbles mixed with a little helium gas ,which makes them lighter than air and float in the sky. Special machines are used to make these new funny Flogos. The machine, which can be rented for 2,500 a day, can make a Flogo every 15-25 seconds. Flogos can fly much higher or lower if needed. They can last from a few minutes to an hour anywhere in the sky, depending on the weather conditions. Though they can fly up to 20, 000 feet, they usually float around at 300- 500 feet. Flogos are only white now, but people hope to have more colorful Flogos in the near future. Flogos are Green, 100% environmentally safe, because the soap used to make the Flogo comes from plants and leaves. So this fun way of advertising is healthy and good for the environment. Question: Flogos are mainly used to _ . Answer: A:","completion":"Flogos are mainly used to advertise and promote products, logos, and events, through creating flying logos in the sky as a unique and innovative form of marketing.

Write an article based on this \\"Sign up for their rewards program. Search for sales on their website. Buy the doll second hand. Make purchases during popular sales.\\"","completion":"Title: Discovering Budget-friendly Strategies to Acquire Your Dream Doll Introduction Doll enthusiasts and collectors often face the challenge of acquiring their desired dolls without breaking the bank. With prices ranging from modest to expensive, it can be daunting to find the perfect way to expand your collection without emptying your wallet. Fortunately, there are several effective methods to secure budget-friendly deals on dolls, ensuring that you can enjoy your passion while staying within your budget. In this article, we will explore four such strategies: signing up for rewards programs, searching for sales on websites, buying dolls second-hand, and making purchases during popular sales events. Step 1: Sign Up for Rewards Programs One of the best ways to save money while shopping for dolls is by taking advantage of rewards programs offered by various retailers and manufacturers. By signing up for these programs, you can often gain access to members-only discounts, perks, and promotions. Justification: Subscribing to a rewards program often comes with exclusive deals and discounts that are not available to regular customers. Additionally, rewards programs may offer points for every dollar spent, which can be redeemed for merchandise, further discounts, or other benefits. By signing up, doll enthusiasts can save money and potentially receive other bonuses. Step 2: Search for Sales on Their Website Another effective way to save money on doll purchases is to look for sales and discounts directly on retailer websites. Many websites have dedicated sales pages where customers can find various deals and promotions on dolls and other merchandise. Justification: Retailers often have seasonal sales, promotional deals, or clearance events throughout the year that can lead to substantial savings on merchandise. By actively searching for these opportunities, doll collectors can often find reduced prices and save money on their purchases. Step 3: Buy the Doll Second-Hand Opting to buy a doll second-hand can result in exceptional savings for the collector. Whether purchased from a reputable doll reseller, online auction sites, or even local thrift shops and garage sales, pre-owned dolls often come with lower price tags than new ones. Justification: Pre-owned dolls are usually more affordable since they have been previously owned and may carry imperfections. However, these imperfections can sometimes be overlooked or repaired by the collector, and finding a sought-after or rare doll at a reduced price is a thrilling experience for enthusiasts. Step 4: Make Purchases During Popular Sales Timing your doll purchases around popular sales events, such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or end-of-season sales, can lead to significant savings. Many retailers and manufacturers participate in these events, offering excellent deals on a wide range of dolls and accessories. Justification: Sales events often lead to reduced prices on merchandise as retailers attempt to attract customers and clear out inventory. By capitalizing on these events, doll collectors can acquire additions to their collection at a fraction of the usual cost. Conclusion In summary, there are several budget-friendly strategies that doll enthusiasts can use to acquire their dream dolls without overspending. By signing up for rewards programs, searching for sales on websites, buying dolls second-hand, and making purchases during popular sales events, collectors can enjoy their passion while staying within their budget. With a little effort and research, any doll enthusiast can secure amazing deals on their favorite dolls and expand their collection responsibly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Until recently, in most critical writing the post-punk era was \\"often dismissed as an awkward period in which punk's gleeful ructions petered out into the vacuity of the Eighties\\". Contemporary scholars have argued to the contrary, asserting that the period produced significant innovations and music on its own. Simon Reynolds described the period as \\"a fair match for the sixties in terms of the sheer amount of great music created, the spirit of adventure and idealism that infused it, and the way that the music seemed inextricably connected to the political and social turbulence of its era\\". Nicholas Lezard wrote that the music of the period \\"was avant-garde, open to any musical possibilities that suggested themselves, united only in the sense that it was very often cerebral, concocted by brainy young men and women interested as much in disturbing the audience, or making them think, as in making a pop song\\".

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: How high was the plane in the air before it disappeared? 10,000 feet Answer:","completion":"Title: Vanished at 10,000 Feet Genre: Action, Thriller, Mystery Plot: Act 1 - Introducing the Characters and Setting The story follows Sam Anderson, a former U.S. Air Force investigator who now works for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as an aviation incident investigator. He currently resides with his wife, Sarah, and his ten-year-old daughter, Emily, in a suburban neighborhood near Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. A new high-tech airplane, known as the Hope One, is about to embark on its maiden flight from Chicago to Sydney. The flight is anticipated due to its groundbreaking eco-friendly technology that could revolutionize the aviation industry. The passengers include prominent environmentalists, innovators, and representatives from the United Nations, all invited to witness this historical event. Among these passengers is Sam's best friend, Nick Foster, an environmental engineer. Act 2 - The Plane Disappears As Hope One takes off and reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet, it suddenly and inexplicably disappears from radars without a trace. The control tower receives no distress signals from the plane, and no wreckage can be found in the area where it vanished. Sam, devastated by his friend's presumed demise, receives a mysterious text message from an unknown number, claiming Nick is alive and that the disappearance of Hope One is part of a much larger, sinister conspiracy. The message contains clues that lead Sam to the remote forests of Northern Canada. Act 3 - The Investigation Begins Determined to uncover the truth and save his friend, Sam takes a leave of absence from the FAA and travels to Canada without informing his superiors. There, he teams up with Sarah, a local journalist with her own reasons for investigating the Hope One disappearance. Together, they face many obstacles, including hostile locals, dangerous wildlife, and a shadowy organization that seems intent on stopping their investigation. As they dig deeper into the conspiracy, they come across a hidden research facility and discover that the plane is hidden there. Act 4 - Unraveling the Conspiracy Sam and Sarah infiltrate the facility and discover that a rogue faction has hijacked Hope One and kidnapped the passengers in an attempt to seize the technology for themselves and weaponize it. As the duo works together to stop the villains and rescue the passengers, they uncover the organization's connections to powerful and influential individuals around the world. The climax involves a high-stakes standoff between Sam, Sarah, and the antagonists as they attempt to regain control of Hope One and reveal the truth to the world. In the process, they manage to prevent the weaponization of the technology and rescue Nick and the other passengers. Act 5 - Conclusion and Resolution With the rescued passengers safely returned, Sam and Sarah expose the global conspiracy, resulting in the arrest of the villains and uncovering the sinister motives of those in power. The Hope One technology is later implemented safely and revolutionizes the aviation industry, changing the world for the better. Sam returns to his life as an investigator with newfound conviction, knowing that his actions have made a difference in the world, as Sarah goes on to become an award-winning journalist. The movie ends with a heartfelt reunion between Sam and Nick, as Sam refocuses his efforts on his family and his duty to protect the skies. Throughout the movie, the question of how high the plane was in the air before it disappeared (10,000 feet) acts as a central enigma that escalates tension and drives the characters on their perilous journey to find the truth about the Hope One disappearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy).

Passage:Tropical Storm Fay was a strong and unusual tropical storm that moved erratically across the state of Florida and the Caribbean Sea. The sixth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay formed from a vigorous tropical wave on August 15 over the Dominican Republic. It passed over the island of Hispaniola, into the Gulf of Gonâve, across the island of Cuba, and made landfall on the Florida Keys late in the afternoon of August 18 before veering into the Gulf of Mexico. It again made landfall near Naples, Florida, in the early hours of August 19 and progressed northeast through the Florida peninsula, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Melbourne on August 20. Extensive flooding took place in parts of Florida as a result of its slow movement. On August 21, it made landfall again near New Smyrna Beach, Florida, moving due west across the Panhandle, crossing Gainesville and Panama City, Florida. As it zigzagged from water to land, it became the first storm in recorded history to make landfall in Florida four times. Thirty-six deaths were blamed on Fay. The storm also resulted in one of the most prolific tropical cyclone related tornado outbreaks on record. A total of 81 tornadoes touched down across five states, three of which were rated as EF2.

During a Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans, a group of friends including Ben and his best friend Marcus decide to go on a haunted swamp tour. They find the tour closed because the guide, Rev. Zombie, was sued for negligence. Rev. Zombie suggests they try a place farther down the street, owned by the over-the-top, inexperienced tour guide Shawn. Marcus decides to leave but changes his mind upon seeing two topless girls: Misty, a ditzy porn star, and Jenna, a bossy, boastful, up-and-coming actress. Their sleazy director, Doug Shapiro, is also present. Ben pays for himself and Marcus and Shawn leads them to his tour bus, where the other tourists, Jim and Shannon Permatteo, a Minnesota married couple, and the quiet, hot-tempered Marybeth are waiting. Shawn does not know what he is doing, which the others realize as they arrive at the swamp. Shapiro has Misty and Jenna strip down and film a scene for Bayou Beavers as everyone boards the boat, while a homeless swamp-dweller named Jack Cracker warns them away from the swamp.

Today, we are going to talk about percentages. Percentages show us how much of something there is in a group of 100. For example, if 20 people out of 100 have blue eyes, then 20 percent of the people have blue eyes. Now, let's try to figure out how many people were not aged 18 to 24. Imagine we have a group of 100 people. We know some of these people are between 18 and 24 years old, but we need to find out the number of people outside of this age range. Let's pretend there are 30 people in this group who are aged 18 to 24. To find the percentage of people who are not 18 to 24 years old, we have to subtract the 30 people who are in this age range from the total group of 100. Here's the math: 100 (total people) - 30 (aged 18-24) = 70 (not aged 18-24) So, now we know that 70 people out of 100 are not aged 18 to 24. To find the percentage, we just have to write this number out of 100. 70 out of 100 can be written as: 70/100 = 70% So there you have it!

Now, researchers report that short people--at least in the past--were also more likely to die at a younger age than their taller peers.

The conclusion was based on 490 sets of adult skeletal remains from an archaeological site in northeastern England , YC dating from the 9th century to about 1850 . About 55% of men and 73% of women died before the age of 45, and 39% of men and 56% of women died before age 30.

Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed. Paragraph: A new volcano is growing underwater. Every few days it has minor lava flow eruptions off the coast of Hawaii.

Article: If you travel to a new exhibition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers, you will have chances to see some meat-eating plants. Take bladderworts, a kind of such plant, for example. They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. \\"But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!\\" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days. Some of these pitchers are large enough to hold 7.5 liters. Meat-eating plants only eat people in science fiction movies, but sometimes a bird or other small animals will discover that a pitcher plant isn't a good place to get a drink. Question: What can be captured by meat-eating plants for food? Answer: A:","completion":"Insects and small animals Meat-eating plants, also known as carnivorous plants, primarily capture insects for food. Some common examples include bladderworts and pitcher plants. Bladderworts are able to capture small insects using a trap door mechanism, while pitcher plants use their attractive appearance and nectar-filled pitchers to lure insects. Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls prevent the insects from escaping, allowing the plants to digest them with enzymes. In some cases, meat-eating plants may also capture small animals like birds that mistakenly try to drink from the pitcher plant; however, this is not their primary food source. These plants have evolved to capture insects and small animals in order to supplement their nutrient intake from the nutrient-poor soils they typically inhabit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -2*f + 269 = 251 for f.","completion":"To solve the equation -2*f + 269 = 251 for the variable f, we need to follow these steps: 1. Our main goal is to isolate f on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll first work on moving the constant part (269) to the other side of the equation, making it easier to solve for f. 2. Currently, the equation is -2*f + 269 = 251. We can subtract 269 from both sides of the equation to cancel out the +269 on the left side. 3. After subtracting 269 from both sides, we get: -2*f + 269 - 269 = 251 - 269 -2*f = -18 4. Now, we'll focus on isolating f by getting rid of the -2 coefficient in front of f. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -2. 5. Dividing both sides by -2, we get: (-2*f) / -2 = (-18) / -2 f = 9 6.

Richard Melville Hall (born September 11, 1965), better known by his stage name Moby, is an American musician, DJ, record producer, singer, songwriter, photographer and animal rights activist. He is well known for his electronic music, veganism and support of animal rights. Moby has sold over 20 million records worldwide. AllMusic considers him \\"one of the most important dance music figures of the early 1990s, helping bring the music to a mainstream audience both in the UK and in America\\". In January 2010, Moby announced that he was to begin working on his next record. He said \\"the mood for this record will be more acoustic and less electronic than before\\". Around this time Moby started a heavy metal band with his friend Phil Costello, Diamondsnake, getting back to his roots. Diamondsnake released two albums on Facebook. On February 15, 2011, Moby announced the release of his new album, Destroyed. It was released on May 16, 2011. A photography book with the same name was also released around the time of the album. \\"Musically\\", he said, \\"it's very melodic and atmospheric and electronic, and if i had to sum it up i would describe it as: 'broken down melodic electronic music for empty cities at 2 a.m'.\\" The album cover, which was released with the new information, was taken in LaGuardia Airport. It is a picture of a sign that reads 'destroyed', part of the longer phrase \\"All unclaimed baggage will be destroyed.\\" The album consists of 15 tracks, one of them previously featured on the compilation A Night in NYC, titled \\"Rockets\\". Along with the album's announcement came the release of the EP Be the One, which contains 3 of the tracks from Destroyed The EP was released free for those who signed up for Moby's mailing list. For the next single, Moby put a poll on his website for fans to choose which single should be released next, and it came to be \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\". On August 30, Moby posted another request for the third official single, this time asking fans to say which should be next, without a poll. After this, he announced the following day through his Twitter that the next singles are \\"After\\" and \\"The Right Thing\\". On April 30, 2012, Moby released Destroyed Remixed, a limited edition 2CD collection of remixes of songs from the 2011 studio album, Destroyed. The release included three new exclusive remixes by David Lynch, Holy Ghost!, and System Divine, and also featured a brand new 30 minute ambient track by Moby called 'All Sides Gone'. Compiled and mixed by Moby, Destroyed Remixed was described as 'an eclectic mix of some the most exciting and interesting artists and DJ's in contemporary music'. Between February and August 2013, Moby performed both acoustic and DJ sets at the Wanderlust Festival, which hosted events in Hawaii, Vermont, California and Colorado in the United States, and also in Canada and Chile internationally. He added a single Asia performance date at the 1 World Music Festival in Singapore. Moby also performed two 75-minute DJ sets at the Coachella festival in April which featured a unique visual collaboration with NASA, with various images from space projected onto screens during the performance. Moby followed-up with another DJ set at the Movement Detroit festival in May. For Record Store Day 2013, Moby released a 7-inch record called The Lonely Night which featured former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan. An accompanying video was created by Colin Rich, of which Moby stated: \\"I'm really excited to have an experimental music video from this great video artist, and I feel like the slow, rich, and languorous desert visuals fit the song perfectly.\\" The track was subsequently released as a download with remixes by Photek, Gregor Tresher, Freescha and Moby himself. In July, Moby announced that he would be releasing a new studio album entitled Innocents. The album had been written and recorded in the previous 18 months and was due for release in October. The album was recorded in Moby's apartment and features a number of guest vocalists, in keeping with earlier releases such as Play, 18 and Wait For Me. As with Destroyed, the photographs comprising the album's artwork were all shot by Moby. The first official single from the album is titled A Case for Shame while the previously released track The Lonely Night will also appear on Innocents. The album was produced by Grammy-winner Mark 'Spike' Stent. It was later revealed in August that The Perfect Life, which features Wayne Coyne, would be the next single, after a casting call for a music video was announced, calling \\"for obese Speedo-sporting bikers, nude rollerskating ghosts, and an S&M gimp proficient in rhythmic gymnastics\\" Moby performed a DJ set in Las Vegas on September 1, before flying to Australia to DJ at an intimate show in Sydney, on the 19th. Moby will then DJ at the 10th annual Decibel Festival in Seattle. He then returned to Los Angeles to perform three shows at the Fonda Theatre on October 3-5 to promote the album, which would be his only \\"full live shows\\" for 2013 and 2014. Moby stated that the reason for doing little to no touring for this album was that \\"when I go on tour I sit around a lot (cars, airports, hotels, etc), and when I sit around I can't spend my time making music. And pretty much all I want to do in life is stay home and make music. So, thus: a 3 date world tour.\\" He conceded that he might return to world touring in the future. Starting in around 2001, Moby launched a series of co-owned business ventures, with the two most prominent being the \\"Little Idiot Collective\\"--a New York City, U.S. bricks-and-mortar clothing store, comics store, and animation studio that sold the work of an \\"illustrators collective\\"--and a small restaurant and tea shop called Teany. Teany was cofounded in 2002 with his ex-girlfriend Kelly Tisdale. In a November 2006 interview, at which time he had removed himself from any previous business projects. In November 2015 Moby opened the Vegan bistro Little Pine in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The restaurant serves organic, vegan, Mediterranean-inspired dishes and has a retail section with art and books, curated by Moby himself. Moby's vision was to create a space that includes various aspects of society that he cares about. All of the restaurant's profits are donated to animal welfare organizations. On August 23rd 2016 Moby announced the inaugural Circle V Festival along with the official video for 'Don't Leave Me' by Moby & The Void Pacific Choir. The event took place at LA's Fonda Theatre and featured Blaqk Audio & Cold Cave on the bill amongst others in the evening and talks and vegan food stalls in the afternoon. Moby described Circle V as \\"the coming together of my life's work, animal rights and music. I couldn't be more excited about this event and am so proud to be head-lining.\\" The second Circle V event took place on November 18th this time at The Regent Theatre in Los Angeles. Moby headlined the event for the second year with artists Waka Flocka Flame, Dreamcar and Raury featuring on the bill.

Key village presented higher levels of both indoor and outdoor pollution. Which village had a lower level of air pollutants? Hint: Air pollution can also indirectly cause other health issues and even deaths. Air pollutants can cause an increase in cancer including lung cancer, eye problems, and other conditions. For example, using certain chemicals on farms, such as the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl), can cause cancer. Indoors, pollutants such as radon or asbestos can also increase your cancer risk. Lastly, air pollution can lead to heart disease, including heart attack and stroke. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the question, Key village presents higher levels of both indoor and outdoor pollution compared to Auburn village. Therefore, it is evident that Auburn village has a lower level of air pollutants. Air pollution is a severe problem that has drastic effects on human health, the environment, and the ecosystem. There are various sources of air pollutants, including vehicles, industries, burning of fossil fuels, and other anthropogenic activities. These pollutants can be classified into two major groups: indoor and outdoor pollutants. Indoor air pollutants mainly comprise tobacco smoke, radon, asbestos, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and biological agents such as bacteria, mold, and viruses. On the other hand, outdoor air pollutants include particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). Both indoor and outdoor pollutants can have severe consequences on human health. As mentioned in the hint, air pollution can indirectly cause various health issues, including increased risks of cancer, eye problems, and other chronic conditions. The use of persistent, toxic chemicals like DDT and PCBs in agriculture can contribute to the increased risk of developing cancer. Similarly, indoor pollutants such as radon and asbestos can elevate one's chances of developing lung cancer and other health issues. Furthermore, air pollution has been linked to heart disease, including heart attacks and strokes. Given that Key village has higher levels of air pollution, one can deduce that the inhabitants of this village face greater risks of developing these health problems compared to those living in Auburn village. Air pollution can exacerbate existing medical conditions, lead to the development of new health issues, and even cause premature deaths. It is crucial for both villages, especially Key village, to implement measures to reduce air pollution, improve overall air quality, and protect the health of their residents. Possible steps to control air pollution include promoting the use of clean fuels and energy-efficient vehicles, regulating industrial emissions, encouraging the adoption of sustainable agriculture practices, and increasing public awareness of the importance of maintaining indoor air quality.

Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Paragraph: Two researchers studied air quality over the North Pole, and over Antarctica.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choices: 1). no 2). yes","completion":"The three literary devices – irony, contradiction, and paradox – operate on different levels and serve unique purposes within the realm of language and communication. To understand their differences, it is important to analyze their definitions, explore their usages, and distinguish their specific nuances. 1. Irony Irony is a rhetorical device used to express the opposite of what is intended or expected. It occurs when there is a discrepancy between what is said (or written) and what actually happens. Irony creates a sense of humor, surprise, or thought-provoking revelation. There are three main types of irony: a. Verbal Irony: When the speaker says something, but means the opposite. b. Situational Irony: When an event occurs that is the opposite of what one expects. c. Dramatic Irony: When the audience knows something that the characters do not. 2. Contradiction A contradiction occurs when two statements, ideas, or actions are incompatible or oppose one another – to the point where they cannot both be true or valid at once. Contradictions are logical inconsistencies that reveal when a statement has a flaw or is refutable. In language and argumentation, contradictions often emerge when a speaker's or writer's premise negates its own conclusion or when two propositions cancel each other out. 3. Paradox A paradox is a statement or situation that appears to be contradictory or opposed to common sense, yet may still be true or valid upon closer analysis. Paradoxes often contain elements of truth, but the outcome is unanticipated or perplexing. They provoke thought, challenge assumptions, and can illuminate deeper insights. Paradoxes differ from contradictions, as contradictions negate themselves, rendering them evidently false, whereas paradoxes present seemingly absurd situations that may actually harbor a hidden truth. Now, addressing the question \\"What is the difference between irony and paradox?\\" – the primary distinction lies in their purposes and outcomes. While irony often serves to create humor, surprise, or provoke reflection, paradoxes challenge established beliefs and provoke deeper contemplation by presenting seemingly illogical or absurd situations that may reveal unexpected truths. Irony highlights the disparity between expectation and reality, whereas paradoxes reveal the complexity of seemingly contradictory statements or situations that may hold underlying veracity. Finally, to answer the last question, \\"Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?\\": 1). No These questions are not paraphrases, as the first question compares irony, contradiction, and paradox, while the second question focuses specifically on the difference between irony and paradox. Though the second question is a subset of the first, it does not encompass the full scope of the initial inquiry, and therefore, cannot be considered a paraphrase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most questions can have only one correct answer. Passage: In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire, France's foremost music academy. The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo. He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile, for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize. The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).

If I tell you that Cave roofs are formed by deposition, and ask you the question \\"what is formed by deposition?\\", is the correct answer \\"h2o\\"? OPTIONS: (A). Yes; (B). No;","completion":"(B). No The correct answer is \\"No\\" because cave roofs are not formed by the deposition of H2O (water). Instead, cave roofs, as well as other cave structures like stalactites, stalagmites, and flowstones, are formed by the deposition of minerals, primarily calcite (CaCO3) which is dissolved from limestone by water. Deposition is a geological process where particles or minerals transported by water, wind, or ice settle down and accumulate in a new location, eventually forming different structures or landforms. In the case of cave formation, dissolution of limestone rock occurs as a result of the interaction between water (especially groundwater) and carbon dioxide (CO2). This leads to the formation of carbonic acid (H2CO3), which reacts with the limestone, dissolving the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) present in the stone. When the water containing dissolved calcium carbonate reaches the air-filled caves, carbon dioxide is released from the solution, and the dissolved calcium carbonate gets deposited on the cave walls, floor, and roof. Over time, these deposits form structures such as stalactites (hanging from the cave roofs), stalagmites (rising from the cave floor), columns (when stalactites and stalagmites join together), and flowstones (deposits on walls and floors). Cave roofs are formed through a similar process of deposition, where dissolved minerals in the water moving through the cave system are left behind as the water evaporates or drips away. This progressive deposition of minerals strengthens the roof of the cave, allowing it to bear the weight of the overlying rock layers. While H2O (water) plays a crucial role in the dissolution and deposition processes in cave formation, it is not formed by deposition itself. Instead, the structures and features within caves, including cave roofs, are formed by the deposition of dissolved minerals, such as calcite, carried by water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Congress enacted a 10 percent luxury surcharge tax on boats over 100,000, cars over 30,000, aircraft over 250,000, and furs and jewelry over 10,000. The federal government estimated that it would raise 9 billion in excess revenues over the following five-year period. However, only two years after its imposition, in August 1993, the Congress decided to eliminate the \`\`luxury tax'' since it did not achieve its main objective. It is noteworthy that it \`\`failed'' by only raising 8.9 billion--that is, it fell 97 million short of its projected revenue. According to the tax's critics, these revenues were disappointing and unsatisfactory and also negatively impacted the incomes of the sellers of the luxury items.

The answer is:","completion":"No, the supposed perturbation of 'more roots breaking up the rock' does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of birds fledging the nest in the context provided.

Thus, we can't accurately establish a correlation without additional context or clarifying information on the manner of this disruption and how it influences the birds' behavior. The life cycle of birds and the process of roots breaking up rocks belong to different ecological dynamics and are generally controlled by different sets of processes.

This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words.

In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

In today's world, many people use a mobile phone especially businessmen and businesswomen. These people are an important part of the business world and help our economies develop. In fact in some countries even children and the elderly use mobile phones to keep in touch with family and friends. We know how useful it is to have a mobile phone, but do we know how safe these phones are? Some scientists say that mobile phones could be a risk to our health. So, money is being given to scientific research to find out if mobile phones may be harmful in any way. What does the future look like? Is a hands - free phone the answer? The idea behind hands - free sets is simple and maybe they are a safer way for people to communicate. The hands - free set has a piece in your ear and a microphone near your mouth which is connected to a wire that goes into your phone. Some scientists think this is a much safer way to use a phone. Some scientists have proved that a mobile phone 10 centimeters from your head is far safer than if the headset is right against your ear. Some reports say that hands - free sets have 95% less radiation exposure, while other reports say that hands - free sets expose you to more radiation. Governments and the mobile phone industry are researching the effects, including: * the effects of radio waves on blood pressure and the brain, such as the abilities to concentrate, remember and learn the connections between mobile phone use and brain cancer long - term effects of mobile phone use, looking at health histories of people who have used mobiles since the 1980s. They will be looking at both current mobile phones and the new generation of 4G phones. The results from these studies will help us understand more about the world beyond mobile communications. Wouldn't it be strange if scientists discovered that mobile phones were too dangerous and we had to stop using them and go back to writing letter and using the normal telephone?

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First Question: What are some ways to sweat out a cold? Sweating out a cold refers to the practice of using various methods to induce sweating and increase body temperature to help the immune system in fighting off a cold. Although it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of this practice, some people still believe it can help alleviate cold symptoms. Here are some ways that people attempt to sweat out a cold: 1. Steam inhalation: Breathing in steam from a bowl of hot water or while taking a hot shower can help clear nasal congestion, soothe irritated nasal passages, and induce sweating. Adding essential oils like eucalyptus oil, menthol, or camphor oil can further enhance the experience and potentially assist in decongestion. 2. Hot liquids: Drinking hot fluids, such as tea, warm water with lemon and honey, or soup, may raise the body's temperature and facilitate sweating. The fluids also help keep the body hydrated, which is essential for recovery. 3. Warm clothing: Bundling up in warm clothing and blankets can increase body temperature, leading to sweating. However, it is crucial not to overheat the body as it may worsen the symptoms of a cold. 4. Exercise: Engaging in moderate exercise can increase blood circulation and boost body temperature, causing sweat production. However, it is essential to avoid over-exertion and to listen to your body as rest is also integral to the recovery process. 5. Sauna or steam rooms: Saunas and steam rooms can help raise body temperature and induce sweating. While it has not been scientifically proven that these methods directly help recover from a cold, they may offer temporary relief for congestion and discomfort. 6. Spicy foods: Consuming spicy foods with ingredients like chili peppers, ginger, or garlic, can cause sweating and temporarily clear congestion. These foods also have antimicrobial properties that may support the immune system. Second Question: How do you sweat out a cold? To sweat out a cold, one can try a combination of the methods mentioned above. It is essential to approach this process with balance and without overdoing it, as too much heat or exertion can be harmful. It is also important to monitor your body's response to these methods and to stop if you experience any discomfort or worsening of symptoms. Taking proper rest, hydrating, and adopting a healthy diet while trying these remedies is essential to recovery. Please consult a healthcare professional if symptoms persist or if there is any concern about these methods. Conclusion: Are these two questions asking the same thing? These two questions are indeed closely related, as they both inquire about methods of sweating out a cold. The first question focuses on asking for various ways to induce sweating to address a cold, while the second question asks for the process of using those ways effectively. The main difference lies in the specificity of the question being asked – the first question seeks a list of methods while the second question focuses on how the process generally works. However, the answers to both questions essentially cover similar information with a slight variance in their perspective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Former Wales and Scarlets prop Rhys Thomas is undergoing surgery on Tuesday ahead of a heart transplant. Thomas, 32, announced his retirement from rugby in April 2012 after suffering a heart attack in January of that year. On that occasion he was taken ill while taking part in a cardio session in the gym at Scarlets' ground, treated by their medical team and then rushed to hospital, where he underwent a life-saving quadruple heart bypass operation. Under the knife: Former Wales prop Rhys Thomas is having surgery on Tuesday ahead of a heart transplant. Thomas' agent Christian Abt was quoted on Tuesday by the BBC as saying: 'I can confirm he is having an operation today to prepare him for a heart transplant in the near future.' Among Thomas' former team-mates wishing him well on Twitter were Scarlets and Wales centre Scott Williams, who wrote: 'All the best with the op.' And Ospreys number eight Joe Bearman, who played with Thomas at Newport Gwent Dragons, wrote: 'Good luck big guy. Get that pump in there, our thoughts are with you mate.' South Africa-born Thomas, who won seven caps for Wales, came through the ranks at Newport, breaking into the first team in 2003 and going on to earn a place in the Dragons squad when Welsh rugby turned to a regional model. Good luck: Thomas, seen here playing for Scarlets, has been inundated with messages wishing him well. His impressive form for the Rodney Parade side saw him win his first cap as a replacement in the first Test on the tour of Argentina in 2006. But he missed several months of the following season after suffering what he has described as a 'mild heart attack', before eventually being given medical clearance to return to action. He started against Italy during Wales' 2008 Grand Slam campaign after missing out on selection for the 2007 World Cup, and left the Dragons in 2009 to join the Scarlets.","completion":"This article is about a former rugby player named Rhys Thomas. He used to play for Wales and Scarlets. He had to stop playing rugby in 2012 because he had a heart attack. Now, Rhys is 32 years old and he needs a new heart, so he is having surgery to prepare for a heart transplant. Many of his friends and former teammates are sending him good wishes on Twitter. Rhys has had some heart problems before, but he has always been able to play rugby again after recovering. This time, he needs a new heart to help him stay healthy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The tourists thought that the baby bison looked cold. They put it in their car and drove to a park ranger station. A ranger described the action of the tourists as a \\"dangerous move\\" because adult bisons can look after their babies very well and they will attack to protect their young. Park rangers took the animal from the car and set it free. But, sadly, the baby was refused by its family because it had the smell from humans. Yellowstone National Park explained on Facebook that the smell from people can cause parent animals to refuse to accept their young. The park tried again and again to make the baby bison lives with its parents. After several times they had to give up. Many people expressed anger at both the tourists and the park. The park said that they did not have the ability to care for a young bison. They also said that it is \\"not the task of the park to save animals\\". The tourists were fined 110 for touching park wildlife. Park rules say that visitors to Yellowstone should stay at least 22 meters away from all wildlife, and at least 90 meters away from bears and wolves. One ranger said that Yellowstone recently added many safety signs that say staying near the wildlife there is dangerous to humans and animals as well. Those signs are written in English and other languages. Question: From the passage, we can learn that _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"we'll be fined if we save a bison in the park\\"? A:","completion":"From the passage, we can learn that putting a wild baby bison in a car and attempting to save it can lead to unintended consequences, including the rejection of the baby bison by its family due to the smell from humans. The passage also emphasizes the importance of respecting park rules to maintain a safe distance from wildlife in order to protect both humans and animals. As for the answer to the question \\"we'll be fined if we save a bison in the park,\\" based on the passage, the answer is \\"yes.\\" The tourists who attempted to save the baby bison by bringing it to a park ranger station were fined 110 for touching park wildlife. It's essential to understand that park rules are in place to protect both visitors and the animals, and interfering with wildlife, even with good intentions, can lead to negative outcomes. In this case, it is crucial to respect the park's rules and allow the animals to live and thrive in their natural environment without human intervention."},{"prompt":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Back at their house by the cemetery, Paul and Chloe found Bee in her room, what Paul referred to as her sanctum sanctorum - although no one else ever got the joke, and he refused to explain the comic book reference. As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice. Big Brother sounds so mean.\\" \\"What's mean about a reality show?\\" said Paul, joking. \\"What isn't bad about a reality show?\\" countered Chloe, stepping in to defend her friend.

(1) Other players played a prominent role in the introduction, such as Mike Caroll (the logo) and Tom Howard (more men).

In this context, it suggests that Mike Caroll and Tom Howard were key contributors to this important process, wherein Mike Caroll played a significant role in creating or presenting the logo, and Tom Howard was involved in recruiting, managing, or attracting more men. (2) Other players played a prominent role in the launching, such as Tom Howard (the logo) and Mike Caroll (more men). The second sentence focuses on the launching, which implies the formal initiation or beginning of a project, undertaking, or idea. In this scenario, Tom Howard and Mike Caroll's contributions were crucial in the act of going live with the endeavor. The positions of the names have been switched, with Tom Howard now associated with the logo, and Mike Caroll playing a role in the involvement of more men.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie.

Three: This is not a gland, and thus cannot be considered for impact on human metabolism. 2. Pituitary: As mentioned, the pituitary gland secretes tSH, which stimulates the thyroid gland to produce hormones. These hormones are crucial in regulating metabolism, making the pituitary gland a significant factor in human metabolism. 3. Energy: This is not a gland; it's a general term for describing the capacity to do work or produce heat. It cannot be directly compared to the glands. 4. Chlorophyll: This is not a gland, but rather a pigment that helps plants with photosynthesis, and it is not directly related to human metabolism. 5. Sweat: This term refers to the fluid excreted by sweat glands, which helps in temperature regulation but does not have a significant impact on metabolism. 6. Energy usage: This is not a gland; it represents the process of utilizing energy in the body, which can be influenced by metabolism but is not a gland itself. 7. Salivary: The salivary glands help in digestion by producing saliva, which breaks down food. While they play a role in the digestive system, they do not significantly impact overall human metabolism. 8. Mammary: Mammary glands produce milk to nourish offspring and are only functional during lactation. They don't have a significant impact on human metabolism.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: This independent, B&W, DV feature consistently shocks, amazes and amuses with it's ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them. It's all hilarious and ridiculous stuff, yet as absurd as much of the film should be, there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded, keeps the entire piece from drifting into complete craziness and therein lies the real message here. This film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad. That seems to be the heart of the film. For as insane and off the wall as things get, Leon, the 30 yr. old paperboy-protagonist, always tries to keep it together. He's like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best, so that everyone can have what they want. The acting in the film could have went far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive. Van Meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a performance that shines through her absurd diseased tics. Just as the characters in the film do, we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath. Majkowski is a true genius here. He takes the utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real. It is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing afloat. It's a true testament to the skill of Majkowski and all involved that this film, with it's grating plot and characters, never once works our nerves. Majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and repugnant, and somehow given it heart and humor. This is a unique film.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- A brain surgeon performed what he called a \\"life-saving\\" surgery on a teenager by removing a large brain tumor using a method he read about on CNN.com just three days earlier. Dr. Thomas Ellis is a senior neurosurgeon at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. Dr. Thomas Ellis, a senior neurosurgeon at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina, the United States, said he had become \\"very demoralized\\" after an unsuccessful six-hour operation to remove a tumor from a 19-year-old named Brandon. \\"I had had to give the boy's mother the bad news and that is not something I am used to. She was crying and it was very hard. Your story truly came at the perfect time,\\" Ellis said. Ellis operated on","completion":"Brandon after reading about a new technique on CNN.com that involved using a special dye to make the tumor more visible during surgery. This innovative method, developed by a team of researchers and medical professionals in London, allowed surgeons to distinguish between healthy brain tissue and the tumor, making it easier to remove the entire growth without damaging the surrounding brain tissue. Inspired by the story, Dr. Ellis contacted the team in London to learn more about the technique. They provided him with the necessary information and support, even sending him the special dye to use during Brandon's surgery. Dr. Ellis, determined to give the young man a chance at a tumor-free life, decided to attempt the surgery once more, now equipped with the newfound knowledge and tools. As the day of the surgery arrived, both Brandon and his family were understandably anxious, but they put their trust in Dr. Ellis and the new method. The surgery began, and the medical team closely followed the steps of the new technique. The special dye indeed made the tumor more visible, allowing Dr. Ellis to skillfully remove the entire growth without endangering healthy brain tissue. The surgery lasted several hours, but the outcome was a success. Brandon was moved to a recovery room, and his family anxiously awaited any news. When Dr. Ellis emerged from the operating room and informed them that the tumor had been successfully removed and that there were no complications, a wave of relief washed over them. In the weeks that followed, Brandon steadily recovered from the surgery. The post-operative tests and scans showed no traces of the tumor left in his brain. Dr. Ellis, his team, and the team in London who had developed the dye remained in close contact, ensuring that Brandon's recovery was on track. Brandon's story gained widespread attention in the media, lauding Dr. Ellis not only for his skill as a surgeon but also for his persistence and dedication. The method involving the special dye became a valuable tool for other brain surgeons around the world, ultimately saving many lives. Brandon, grateful for his second chance at life, decided to use his experience to help others facing similar challenges. He became an advocate for brain tumor awareness and research, sharing his story and working closely with foundations and organizations. As the years passed, Brandon completed his studies, found a fulfilling career, and started a family of his own. He remained close to Dr. Ellis, expressing his gratitude for the doctor's life-changing work repeatedly. Brandon's story inspired many and led to vital advancements in brain tumor research and treatment, saving and improving countless lives. In the end, the story of a surgeon's determination, a ground-breaking technique, and a young man's resilience came together to create a tale of hope, healing, and the power of partnership in the scientific and medical community. The collaboration and trust bridging continents ensured that more lives, like Brandon's, could be saved through innovative, life-saving techniques like the one Dr. Ellis read about on CNN.com."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is?","completion":"The answer is: Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austria-Hungary throne, was assassinated in the Bosnian province of Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. Sarajevo, which is now the capital and largest city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the time of the assassination. The empire had annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908, sparking tensions in the region as Serbia, a neighboring nation, harbored ambitions to include these territories in a Greater Serbia that would unite all South Slavic peoples. The assassination took place during the Archduke and his wife, Duchess Sophie's official visit to Sarajevo to inspect the Austrian imperial armed forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The couple arrived in Sarajevo by train before embarking on a procession through the city in an open-top car. Along the way, several conspirators armed with grenades and pistols attempted to assassinate the Archduke. One conspirator threw a bomb that bounced off the Archduke's car but detonated after it fell behind the vehicle, injuring people in another car and attracting a crowd. Later that day, as the royal couple was making their way to a hospital to visit the injured, a wrong turn by the driver brought their motorcade to a halt. This mishap presented Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Serbian secret society known as the Black Hand, with the opportunity to shoot the Archduke and his wife. Princip fired two shots, fatally wounding Franz Ferdinand and Sophie. The assassination set off a chain of events and diplomatic crises that ultimately led to the outbreak of World War I, a tragic conflict that engulfed much of the world from 1914 to 1918. In summary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in the Bosnian province of Sarajevo, an event that played a significant role in shaping the course of history in the early 20th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A spokesman for British Millerain Co Ltd, a waxed cotton fabric manufacturer, told the programme that the firm \\"had more than 150 calls from people who don't owe us money\\". And a spokeswoman for Manchester shelving firm Greenoaks said: \\"My colleague took a call from an elderly gentleman and he was very distressed because his wife had had one of these emails.\\" Dr Steven Murdoch, principal research fellow at the department of computer science at University College London, told You and Yours: \\"Most likely it was a retailer or other internet site that had been hacked into and the database stolen, it then could have been sold or passed through several different people and then eventually it got to the person who sent out these emails.\\" He said that the email bore the hallmark of previous phishing attempts from gangs in Eastern Europe and Russia.

[+] fix the stirrups before adding them back and forth.. [+] hit the ball back and forth with sticks while riding the horses..","completion":"In the following stage of action in the paragraph, the group participates in the traditional manner of polo gameplay by hitting the ball back and forth with sticks while riding the horses. Specifically, the polo players expertly raise their mallets - the long, T-shaped sticks used for striking the small, hard ball in polo - and take their respective stances. Simultaneously, they guide their horses, maintaining control of the animals through a careful balance of leg pressure and rein commands. The dynamic rhythm of the game sets in, with each rider demonstrating their mastery of the sport through their agile manipulation of the horse and the stick. They twist and turn deftly, striking the ball with an impressive balance of power and precision. With a fierce yet studied swing, the ball is then sent hurtling across the grass-covered field, resulting in an exciting change in pace as the players gallop hard to position themselves beneficially. Close quarters battles for possession are common in polo, and the sight of the rider's adroit maneuvering of their horses to gain position proves to be quite a spectacle. This intense ballet of equine agility, human skill, and competitive spirit repeats back and forth across the field as the ball zips from one end to the other. Simultaneously, tactical discussions take place among teammates; effective communication is key in polo. The riders exchange quick words about strategies and tactics, identifying which riders will surge ahead for offense and which riders will hang back for defense, depending on the movement of the ball. Teamwork truly comes to the fore during these exchanges. The well-coordinated play between team members sets up the opportunity for a shot at the goal. The crowd, perched on the edge of their seats, breaks into applause and cheers as one of the riders finally breaks away from the mass of horses and riders at a breakneck gallop, stick raised for the anticipated strike. This back and forth game continues with the riders striving to keep the momentum of the ball in their favor while also steering their powerful steeds. Goal attempts are made with some successful, others thwarted by the opposing team. The galloping of the horses and the shouts of the players add sound to the scene, creating a captivating atmosphere that's typical of a polo match. The game would go on, illustrating the athleticism and competitive spirit intrinsic to the sport of polo."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.\\".

Step 2: Identify possible contradictions. - Sentence 1 mentions some nice things about Java, while Sentence 2 claims there are no nice things about Java. Step 3: Investigate further. By analyzing Sentence 1, it is clear that the author has a positive opinion about Java's features, particularly when comparing it with some aspects of the C programming language. Sentence 2 seems to be more negative about Java. The claim that there are no nice things about the programming language directly contradicts the first statement. Step 4: Determine if the sentences are tautologies or contradictions. - Sentence 1 is not necessarily true or false. It is the author's opinion about the positive aspects of Java as a programming language. - Sentence 2 is also not necessarily true or false. It is another author's opinion against Java.

This is incorrect, as there are no wild penguins in the Northern Hemisphere. The cartoon series Chilly Willy helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interact with northern-hemisphere species, such as polar bears and walruses.

Expand this summary.","completion":"Syrian activists have reported that the Islamic State group executed 33 young men in eastern Syria close to the border with Iraq. According to CNN, this is the largest execution operation carried out by the group this year. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that ISIS members slit the throats of the men, aged between 18 and 25, near the town of Mayadeen in Deir el-Zour province on Wednesday. The identities of the men remain unclear, as it is not known whether they were Syrian troops or rebel fighters. Opposition activist Omar Abu Laila, a native of Deir el-Zour currently residing in Europe, has also confirmed the report of the killings. This mass execution marks another act of brutality by the Islamic State group, continuing their reign of terror in the region. The group has been known for carrying out such horrific acts as a means to maintain control and instill fear among populations. While the specific motive for this particular execution is not clear, it serves as a chilling reminder of the dangers faced by those living in areas under the control of ISIS. As more reports of violence and atrocities committed by the Islamic State group continue to emerge, the international community is called upon to intensify their efforts in fighting against this terrorist organization. Global leaders must collaborate and strategize to put an end to the ongoing violence and to bring those responsible for such heinous acts to justice. Preventing further loss of life and restoring peace to the affected areas remain top priorities in the ongoing battle against ISIS. Additionally, humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGO) must enhance their support for the victims of violence and those displaced by the conflict in Syria and Iraq. Providing trauma care, essential resources, and educational opportunities can help to rebuild and rehabilitate communities ravaged by years of war and terrorism. In summary, the recent reports of the Islamic State group executing 33 young men in eastern Syria is a stark reminder of the ongoing cruelty and violence perpetrated by ISIS. The international community must work together, strengthening efforts to combat terrorism, hold those responsible accountable and support the victims of this brutal conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Similar to the week nine confrontation with the Miami Dolphins, turnovers contributed to the Bears' 17-13 loss against the Patriots. The opening two quarters were a story of turnovers in a Rex Grossman interception by Asante Samuel, a Benjamin Watson catch knocked into the hands of Charles Tillman, a blocked Bears field goal attempt, and fumbles by Laurence Maroney and Grossman. The third quarter saw a bizarre sequence of turnovers - first fumbles by both Watson and Reche Caldwell on the same play, followed by another Samuel interception of Grossman, and finally a second Tillman interception of Brady. Through three quarters the game was tied 10-10 before a drive where Brady faked out Brian Urlacher on a nine-yard run ended in a two-yard score to Watson. Turnovers then ended the game, with a Corey Dillon fumble followed by Samuel's third interception of Grossman.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Absorption The mechanical and digestive processes have one goal: to convert food into molecules small enough to be absorbed by the epithelial cells of the intestinal villi. The absorptive capacity of the alimentary canal is almost endless. Each day, the alimentary canal processes up to 10 liters of food, liquids, and GI secretions, yet less than one liter enters the large intestine. Almost all ingested food, 80 percent of electrolytes, and 90 percent of water are absorbed in the small intestine. Although the entire small intestine is involved in the absorption of water and lipids, most absorption of carbohydrates and proteins occurs in the jejunum. Notably, bile salts and vitamin B12 are absorbed in the terminal ileum. By the time chyme passes from the ileum into the large intestine, it is essentially indigestible food residue (mainly plant fibers like cellulose), some water, and millions of bacteria (Figure 23.32).

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I'm going to take something that happened to my daughter for this answer. Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. Question: Why was the daughter devestated?

A bracingly vivid sense of style and character ... bewildering, abrasive, jarring and surprisingly emotional. 2. The world's most convoluted (and expensive) game of Calvin-ball. 3. The coolest part is those closing credits, in which the entire movie is recapped in three minutes. Somehow, those three minutes seem more compelling than the 110 that preceded them. 4. It's a must-see for anyone who's willing to risk logic and accept a mundane conclusion to enjoy the fruit of a creative mind. 5. There is a lot of buildup throughout the entire piece that's never released. The climax is almost laughable and when the credits finally role, you'll no doubt find yourself yearning for more, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. 6. This mostly incoherent, enormously eccentric helping of mayhem breaks into so many fragments that watching the movie can be a bit like trying to assemble the pieces from several jigsaw puzzles. 7. Night Watch was one of the most popular movies ever released in Russia. That just proves there's no accounting for taste, in film or in human sacrifice. 8. A grim, humorless slog in which even the subtitles are flashy, irritating and completely meaningless. 9. Though too many headstones are left unturned -- the incorporation of ancient folklore into the grimy ghoul hunting balances the Matrix-esque choreography quite nicely. 10. All that matters ... is the onslaught of hallucinogenic images, copious bloodshed and editing that would make a meth addict say, 'Dude, slow down.'","completion":"This collection of movie reviews presents an overall sense of a film that is a chaotic, eccentric, and visually striking blend of styles and elements. Many of the reviewers appreciate the film's bold and vivid artistry, describing it as bewildering, abrasive, jarring, and emotional. However, they also criticize the overly complex plot, suggesting that it is convoluted and expensive. Some reviewers found the closing credits to be the most appealing aspect of the film, as they managed to compress the movie into a more compelling format. Others recommend the film for those willing to overlook the lack of logic and accept a mundane conclusion, appreciating the creativity and effort put into it. The film appears to have significant issues in regards to its pacing and buildup. Critics mention that there is a lot of tension throughout the story but it never pays off, leading to a climax that is laughable and unsatisfying. This leaves the audience feeling simultaneously drawn in, yet wanting more due to the unfinished nature of the storyline. The movie's incoherence and eccentricity are highlighted by reviewers as major setbacks, comparing the overall experience to assembling a jumbled puzzle. The film's popularity in Russia as one of the most successful releases is noted, with some critics finding this difficult to comprehend due to the film's shortcomings. Viewers also found the stylistic choices within the movie to be a mixed bag, varying from flashy and irritating subtitles to the creative incorporation of ancient folklore. The action sequences are compared to the Matrix, as they balance well with the gritty atmosphere of the film. Ultimately, the primary focus of the film appears to be on its hallucinogenic imagery, intense bloodshed, and rapid editing, which proves to be both a strength and a weakness in creating a memorable, yet disjointed cinematic experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Google Street View Car Gets Chased Out of Broughton It may seem funny, or it may seem like a serious privacy problem, but either way you look at it the incidents regarding Google’s Street View are still piling up. As it turns out, people simply don’t like the idea of anyone photographing their home, even if it’s not against the law to do so. This is, apparently, especially true in the UK town Broughton, whose residents blocked a Google contractor and his Street View car when he tried to take pictures of their homes. The police were called, and the car moved on, but the folks of Broughton aren’t happy. “I don’t have a problem with GoogleGoogle wanting to promote villages. What I have a problem with is the invasion of privacy, taking pictures directly into the home,” resident Paul Jacobs told the BBC. Since it’s not against the law to stand in the street and takes pictures of people’s homes, I doubt this or any similar incident can really stop Google from doing what it’s doing. But it’s a question of scale. If I go out in the street and take a couple of photos, no one will care.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: Youth: Is 19 still young? Yes, 19 is still considered young. At the age of 19, individuals are typically in their late adolescent or emerging adult stage. This stage in life is a time of transition and growth, as individuals progress from adolescence to adulthood. During this time, they often experience psychological, social, and emotional development. In many cultures, 19-year-olds are usually seen as teenagers who are gradually becoming more independent, learning more about their responsibilities, and discovering their place in the world. In legal terms, they may also be considered adults, as they are reaching or have reached the age of majority in most countries (usually between 18-21). Second question: Youth: Are you still young in your 30s? The concept of youth can be subjective and varies from person to person, as well as culturally, but generally, being in your 30s can be considered as a stage between young adulthood and middle age. This stage of life involves maturation, career progression, and often significant life events such as marriage, starting a family, or purchasing a home. While individuals in their 30s may no longer be considered \\"young\\" in the same sense as teenagers or individuals in their early 20s, they are still relatively young compared to those in middle-aged or older adult stages. Additionally, individuals in their 30s often maintain a strong sense of youthfulness, exploring new interests, and staying active in both social and recreational activities. Are these two questions asking the same thing? While both questions are related to the topic of youth, they are not asking the same thing. The first question focuses specifically on the age of 19 and whether that age is considered young. The second question addresses the concept of youth in relation to being in your 30s. These two questions examine different age ranges and stages of life, and therefore are asking distinct aspects of youth. In summary, 19 is still considered young, while being in your 30s might not be considered as young but rather a stage between young adulthood and middle age. However, the perception of youth can be subjective and depends on various factors such as cultural, individual, and societal beliefs. Both questions touch upon the topic of youth, but they are not inquiring about the same age range or stage of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3.

I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship. Question: What is Sophie Richardson in charge of at the Human Rights Campaign?

What is the missing first step of the following process: - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems - The answer to this question is:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is: - Acid rain or acid deposition occurs when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the atmosphere through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels or the extraction and processing of metals. These compounds react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form acidic substances like sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). This leads to the formation of acid rain, which lowers the pH level of soil, making it more acidic. Now the complete process would be: 1. Acid rain or acid deposition lowers the pH level of soil, making it more acidic and causing the release of aluminum ions. 2. The acidic soil causes plants to absorb aluminum from the soil in higher quantities than under normal conditions. 3. The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc., carrying the aluminum and other acidic substances with it. 4. Fish and their eggs die due to the high concentration of aluminum and toxic conditions created by the acidic water. 5. Frogs and plants die, as the habitats they rely on become increasingly uninhabitable due to the toxic conditions. 6. Insects and other wildlife that rely on fish, frogs, or plants as a source of food die due to the lack of available resources. 7.

That being said, let's proceed to do the translation. This sentence will translate into French as: \\"Le droit du père naturel à être entendu dans les procédures, comme l'a soutenu l'auteur, sans la possibilité de bloquer un changement de nom de famille ne serait pas efficace, car la mère et le beau-père auraient le dernier mot en tout cas.\\" Here is a justification for the choices in translation: - \\"A right of the natural father to be heard in the proceedings\\" translates to \\"Le droit du père naturel à être entendu dans les procédures\\". Most of this segment is translated directly, but \\"be heard\\" translates to \\"être entendu\\", as this is the common way this phrase is expressed in French. - \\"as argued by the author\\" translates to \\"comme l'a soutenu l'auteur\\". \\"Argued\\" could be translated in multiple ways in French depending on the context, we've chosen \\"soutenu\\" (supported) to imply that the author is backing up the claim he presented. - \\"without the possibility to block a change of surname\\" translates to \\"sans la possibilité de bloquer un changement de nom de famille\\". The words in this segment are directly translated into French. - \\"would not be effective\\" translates to \\"ne serait pas efficace\\". 'Would not be' is translated as 'ne serait pas' for a potential future scenario. - \\"as mother and stepfather would have the final say in any event\\" translates to \\"car la mère et le beau-père auraient le dernier mot en tout cas\\". It directly translates the phrase while respecting the tense used. \\"Have the final say\\" corresponds to \\"auraient le dernier mot\\" in French, literally meaning \\"would have the last word\\".

Therefore, the correct answer is (D). Science/Tech. The launch of SpaceShipOne represents a significant milestone in the field of space exploration and science. Prior to this event, manned spaceflights were primarily conducted by government-funded agencies like NASA or the Russian Federal Space Agency. The emergence of a privately built manned spacecraft demonstrates that space exploration is no longer solely the domain of government agencies, paving the way for greater involvement from private entities and corporations. The text's mention of the Ansari X Prize adds another layer of importance to this event. The Ansari X Prize was an international competition intended to promote advancements in space technology and encourage private, reusable spacecraft development. SpaceShipOne's successful launch not only secured the 10 million prize but also proved the viability of privately funded spaceflight technology. This has had a massive influence on the space industry, leading to an increased interest in private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic. In conclusion, this text is about the monumental achievement of SpaceShipOne's successful launch, signifying a new era in the science and technology of space exploration.

Whether he was escaping from a locked box or making things disappear and reappear, he surely was entertaining. People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive. Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money. When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko? from the following article ? English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours.

I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either.

Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her.

Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

The trudge through the forest was a task, but they climbed the mountain painlessly, since the Pick from: [i] forest was a hostile environment.; [ii] mountain was a hostile environment.;","completion":"[ii] mountain was a hostile environment. The trudge through the forest was a task, but they climbed the mountain painlessly, since the mountain was a hostile environment. The group was not expecting the climb to be as difficult as it was, and they were grateful that the challenge of the forest had prepared them for this. The forest had been filled with various forms of treacherous terrain - rugged trails scattered with thick tree roots, dense shrubbery blocking the way, and vast muddy patches that often caught them off guard. Despite these challenges, the group managed to overcome each obstacle by working together. They shared supplies, carried each other's gear when necessary, and relied on one another's strengths. The camaraderie and shared determination made the journey through the forest an invigorating experience. Upon reaching the base of the mountain, they brushed off the dirt from their clothes, took a deep breath, and began the steep ascent. Contrary to the path through the forest, the mountain's hostile environment proved strangely beneficial. As they climbed higher, they encountered the freezing temperatures and fierce winds, the air becoming thinner and thinner. As the mountaintop seemed to get closer and further away at the same time, the danger of the climb encouraged them all to focus completely on each step and their survival instincts took over. At this altitude, several unique adaptive qualities began revealing themselves within the group. John, the natural leader, began instinctively assessing the safest and most efficient routes up the mountain. He guided everyone with confidence and decisiveness, never hesitating or second-guessing his choices. Nina, whose endurance had been a crucial factor during their trek through the forest, found herself uniquely suited to the brisk mountainous environment. She quickly discovered that she could manipulate her breathing and heart rate to counter the thinning air. This, in turn, allowed her to maintain her stamina, even as the rest of the group began to struggle. Ravi's experience as a rock climber also unfolded as crucial skill, helping the group scale large sections of rock face that would have been nearly impossible for them to overcome alone. His steady guidance and unwavering encouragement allowed the team to face their fears and push past their physical limits. As the group reached the summit of the mountain, the hostile environment that once threatened them now seemed like a blessing. It tested their resolve and brought out the very best in their abilities. The views from the summit were breathtaking - the expansive skies stretched out around them, and the dense forest they had traversed now appeared as a lush, green carpet far below. The journey through the forest and up the mountain was challenging and dangerous, but it brought the group together in ways they never expected. In the face of adversity, they unlocked new skills and pushed themselves to achieve something extraordinary. As they stood there, triumphant on the mountain summit, they realized that they were stronger together than apart, and that the most hostile environments could lead to the most rewarding experiences. Little did they know that their next challenge was just around the corner - but they were now prepared as a team and as individuals to take on whatever adversity awaited them."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The Premise: \\"Nothing is staged just for guests at the nearby Warner Brothers Studios (4000 Warner Boulevard).\\" This statement implies that any staged events or areas within the mentioned Warner Brothers Studios address are not specifically designed or curated with visitors in mind. In other words, the activities and productions happening within the studio are not tailored or altered to cater to the interests of the guests. 2. The Hypothesis: \\"Everything is put on purely for guests at Warner Brothers Studios.\\" This statement claims that every setup, event, and display within Warner Brothers Studios is designed and executed with the sole purpose of pleasing or entertaining the studio guests. Now, when comparing these two statements, it becomes clear that they are indeed contradictory. The premise clearly states that Warner Brothers Studios does not stage any events or produce any setups for the exclusive benefit of guests, while the hypothesis argues that everything occurring within the studios is exclusively orchestrated for guest satisfaction. It is essential to consider that while some things might be set up to be guest-centric or visitor-friendly, the primary purpose of Warner Brothers Studios is for film and television production. Production studios often serve multiple purposes, such as hosting shoots, sound recordings, and various post-production activities. These activities contribute directly to the core business of creating content and are not designed for the mere purpose of entertaining guests. In conclusion, based on the given premise, one cannot correctly conclude that the proposed hypothesis is indeed true. Instead, the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the primary purpose of Warner Brothers Studios is not exclusively to entertain guests but to focus on its core content production activities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The two sentences are separate and unrelated inquiries. Let's take a closer look at each sentence to understand their meanings and contexts. Sentence 1: \\"What was it?\\" This sentence is asking for an explanation, clarification, or identification of something that was previously mentioned or implied. It could be a reference to an object, an event, a statement, or any other entity that can be referred to as an \\"it\\". For instance, if two people are talking about a movie they just watched, one might ask, \\"What was it?\\" to know the title or the theme of the movie. Sentence 2: \\"Who goes there?\\" This sentence is a question usually asked by a person who is trying to identify someone or something that is approaching or entering a specific area, often used as a challenge or request for identification. Historically, this phrase has been used by military guards or sentinels to question unknown individuals or groups approaching their positions. It can also be used in everyday situations, such as when someone hears a noise in their house and wants to identify the source of the sound. Given the differences in the context and meaning of the two sentences, it is clear that the second sentence is not entailed by the first. In other words, there is no logical or contextual connection between the two sentences that would suggest one follows or is a result of the other. They are simply two separate questions asking for different types of information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"Jules Verne, a French author, wrote numerous adventure and science fiction novels during the 19th century. He is best known for his series \\"Voyages Extraordinaires,\\" which consists of over 60 novels. Although it is impossible to list all of his works here, I will provide information on some of his most famous and influential novels: 1. \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" (1870) - This science fiction novel tells the story of Captain Nemo and his submarine, the Nautilus. It explores the underwater world and presents various scientific concepts, including marine life, oceanography, and technology. 2. \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\" (1873) - In this adventure novel, the protagonist, Phileas Fogg, and his trusty servant Passepartout attempt to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days to win a bet. The book is a testament to global exploration and advances in transportation technology during the 19th century. 3. \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" (1864) - This popular and iconic novel follows a group of explorers led by Professor Otto Lidenbrock as they attempt to descend into the Earth's core. Along the way, they contend with various challenges and strange underground phenomena. 4. \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" (1865) and \\"Around the Moon\\" (1870) - These two novels together form a continuous narrative about space travel. The story explores the idea of using a massive cannon to shoot a projectile containing passengers to the moon. Despite being published decades before the first actual moon landing, many aspects of Verne's story align with future space missions. 5. \\"Five Weeks in a Balloon\\" (1863) - Jules Verne's first published novel is an adventure story set in Africa. It follows the adventures of British scientist Dr. Samuel Fergusson and two companions who attempt a cross-continental flight in a hydrogen-filled balloon. 6. \\"The Mysterious Island\\" (1874) - This novel is a sequel to \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" and \\"In Search of the Castaways.\\" The story follows a group of castaways who use their knowledge of science and technology to survive on an uncharted island. These are just a few of Jules Verne's most well-known works, and his extensive bibliography contains many more fascinating stories. His visionary ideas and imaginative narratives have made him a pioneer in science fiction and a lasting influence on the genre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the answer: Besides chocolate, what is the main flavor of Nutella?","completion":"Besides chocolate, the main flavor of Nutella is hazelnut. Nutella, a popular sweetened spread, was first manufactured in Italy in the 1960s, and has since then gained enormous popularity globally. The spread is made of various key ingredients, with chocolate and hazelnut playing a vital role in defining its distinctive taste. Hazelnuts, also known as filberts, are native to Europe and Asia and are known for their high nutritional value and rich taste. In Nutella, the taste of hazelnuts adds depth and complements the sweetness of the chocolate, resulting in a creamy, smooth, and nutty texture that appeals to people of all ages. The harmonious pairing of chocolate and hazelnuts in Nutella is inspired by the ancient Italian tradition of blending these two flavors together. Gianduja, a type of chocolate originating in the Piedmont region of Italy, is a classic example of this combination and is made from a mix of smooth chocolate and hazelnut paste. Nutella, carrying this legacy forward, has become an iconic product in its own right, widely used as a spread, topping, or ingredient in various recipes. In addition to chocolate and hazelnuts, Nutella also contains other ingredients that contribute to its unique flavor profile. These include sugar, palm oil, skimmed milk powder, and lecithin, which acts as an emulsifier. Vanilla flavoring is also added to enhance the overall taste and give Nutella its distinctive aroma. In summary, while chocolate undoubtedly plays a major role in defining Nutella's flavor, hazelnuts are the other key ingredient that makes the spread irresistible. The combination of these two flavors has not only established Nutella as a household name worldwide but has also inspired countless desserts, snacks, and dishes that celebrate the delightful fusion of chocolate and hazelnuts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He discovered and developed one of the first successful polio vaccines. Born in New York City, he attended New York University School of Medicine, later choosing to do medical research instead of becoming a practicing physician. In 1939, after earning his medical degree, Salk began an internship as a physician scientist at Mount Sinai Hospital. Context: After City College, Salk enrolled in New York University to study medicine. According to Oshinsky, NYU based its modest reputation on famous alumni, such as Walter Reed, who helped conquer yellow fever. Tuition was \\"comparatively low, better still, it did not discriminate against Jews, ... while most of the surrounding medical schools--Cornell, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale--had rigid quotas in place.\\" Yale, for example, accepted 76 applicants, in 1935, out of a pool of 501. Although 200 of the applicants were Jewish, only five got in. During his years at New York University Medical School, Salk worked as a laboratory technician during the school year and as a camp counselor in the summer. During Salk's medical studies, he stood out from his peers, according to Bookchin, \\"not just because of his continued academic prowess--he was Alpha Omega Alpha, the Phi Beta Kappa Society of medical education--but because he had decided he did not want to practice medicine.\\" Instead, he became absorbed in research, even taking a year off to study biochemistry. He later focused more of his studies on bacteriology which had replaced medicine as his primary interest. He said his desire was to help humankind in general rather than single patients. \\"It was the laboratory work, in particular, that gave new direction to his life.\\" According to Salk: \\"My intention was to go to medical school, and then become a medical scientist. I did not intend to practice medicine, although in medical school, and in my internship, I did all the things that were necessary to qualify me in that regard. I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point at the end of my first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis.\\" Concerning his last year of medical school Salk says: \\"I had an opportunity to spend time in elective periods in my last year in medical school, in a laboratory that was involved in studies on influenza. The influenza virus had just been discovered about a few years before that. And, I saw the opportunity at that time to test the question as to whether we could destroy the virus infectivity and still immunize. And so, by carefully designed experiments, we found it was possible to do so.\\" Question: what did he study in med school Answer:","completion":"In med school, Jonas Salk studied medicine, focusing on laboratory work, biochemistry, and bacteriology. He also spent a year in research and teaching in biochemistry and an elective period in a laboratory involved in studies on influenza. During his medical studies, he decided not to practice medicine but instead become a medical scientist and primarily focus on research to help humankind."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What will my children not have to pay if I only leave them 250,000 upon passing in the state of Tennessee?\\" is in \\"The Tennessee income tax does not apply to salaries and wages, but most income from stock, bonds and notes receivable is taxable. All taxable dividends and interest which exceed the 1,250 single exemption or the 2,500 joint exemption are taxable at the rate of 6%. The state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%. Food is taxed at a lower rate of 5.25%, but candy, dietary supplements and prepared food are taxed at the full 7% rate. Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions, at rates varying from 1.5% to 2.75%, bringing the total sales tax to between 8.5% and 9.75%, one of the highest levels in the nation. Intangible property is assessed on the shares of stock of stockholders of any loan company, investment company, insurance company or for-profit cemetery companies. The assessment ratio is 40% of the value multiplied by the tax rate for the jurisdiction. Tennessee imposes an inheritance tax on decedents' estates that exceed maximum single exemption limits (1,000,000 for deaths in 2006 and thereafter).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, your children will not have to pay inheritance tax if you leave them 250,000 upon your passing in the state of Tennessee. This is because Tennessee imposes an inheritance tax on decedents' estates that exceed the maximum single exemption limit, which is 1,000,000 for deaths in 2006 and thereafter. Since the amount you plan to leave for them (250,000) is below the exemption limit, they will not be subject to inheritance tax. It's important to note that this information specifically pertains to inheritance tax. Your children may still be responsible for other taxes depending on the source and nature of the assets they inherit. For instance, if they inherit income from stock or bonds that exceed the individual (1,250) or joint (2,500) exemption limits, this income will be subject to Tennessee's 6% tax rate on dividends and interest. In addition to state taxes, your children might also be responsible for local taxes, depending on the jurisdiction where they reside. Tennessee's local sales tax rates vary between 1.5% and 2.75%, making the total sales tax rate fall between 8.5% and 9.75%. This rate is applied to various goods, with food being taxed at a lower rate (5.25%) and candy, dietary supplements, and prepared food being taxed at the full rate (7%). Furthermore, if your children inherit shares of stock in certain types of companies (i.e. loan, investment, insurance, or for-profit cemetery companies), these shares will be considered intangible property and may be subject to a specific assessment ratio (40% of the value multiplied by the tax rate for the jurisdiction). In summary, although your children will not be subject to inheritance tax on the 250,000 you leave them, they may still be responsible for other taxes related to the assets they inherit, depending on the nature and source of the inheritance. It's vital for them to consult with a tax expert or financial advisor to ensure they understand and comply with all applicable tax obligations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The album contained maximalist and minimalist songs; several tracks on the album were influenced by rock and heavy metal music, and the track \\"Wrestlers\\" started taking a new direction because the band was \\"wrestling with the idea of making an R.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Many Hearts, One Beat: Singing Syncs Up Heart Rates When choir members sing together, it’s not just their voices that join in harmony. According to a study published in the journal Frontiers of Neuroscience, when members of a choir sing together, their heart rates tend to synchronize and beat as one. A team of Swedish researchers led by Björn Vickhoff discovered that this synchronicity can produce a sense of calm that is similar to the effects of yoga. It works like this: a long nerve called the vagus nerve — Latin for “wandering” — trails down from the brain stem into the body, where it influences the heart along with a handful of other organs. Exhaling activates the vagus nerve, which slows the heart’s pulse, Vickhoff says. So, if a group’s breathing is in sync, then it makes sense that the beating of their hearts will be too. MORE: How singing may help stroke victims recover speech “Singing is quite like guided breathing,” Vickhoff says. “If I would say to you, ‘Breathe in…breathe out,’ it would be quite as if you were singing a hymn in the church.” The researchers asked 15 high school students to sing three different song structures while their pulses were recorded. By humming a song, singing a hymn, and chanting a slow manta, the choir members varied the synchronization of their breathing. The hymn required the most rigid breathing pattern, only allowing participants to breathe at the end of musical phrases, while the hum allowed participants to breathe at will. When students sang the hymn, their heart rates were the most in harmony. The synchronized beating isn’t just of musical interest, says Vickhoff, since the finding could inform how singing might help some people to control their breathing and heart rate more effectively. Older people and those who are under stress tend to have less variability in their heart rates, a sign of poorer heart health since their hearts are less able to adjust to the body’s changing needs. Singing, however, brings a more consistent pattern to the changes in heart rate that follows the structure of the music, according to Rickard Åström, a musician who worked on the research team. And the unified heart rates isn’t just symbolic — it has real, emotional effects. The vagus nerve that affects the heart has a serious hand in a person’s sense of arousal or calmness. “When people are singing slow songs together, waves of calming effect go through the choir,” Vickhoff says. The researchers are hesitant to claim any long-term health effects yet, but Vickhoff says they are already preparing another experiment that will examine the effects of the synchrony on cooperation. He and Åström both suspect that choir singers are better at coordination and are more sensitive to one another after experiencing this physical synchrony. Their hope is to see if uniting heart rates can also unite hearts. Watch the researchers discuss the study:","completion":"A study published in the journal Frontiers of Neuroscience found that when members of a choir sing together, their heart rates tend to synchronize, producing a sense of calm similar to the effects of yoga.

He has surged to the front of the pack, leading his rivals by 3 points in the most recent Fox News and USA Today/Suffolk polls, respectively. He has raised issues that have resonated with conservative voters and forced other GOP candidates to come forward on where they stand. It is very likely that he will appear near center-stage at the inaugural Republican debate, on Aug. 6, and lead the pile-on against Jeb Bush. In other words, Trump is a major character in this chapter of the 2016 presidential election story. And as Ginsberg said, \\"you can’t explain what’s happening with the candidates or the country without being on top of all of it.” On Friday, however, the Huffington Post's politics team announced that they would no longer cover the candidate as a political story. \\"After watching and listening to Donald Trump since he announced his candidacy for president, we have decided we won't report on Trump's campaign as part of The Huffington Post's political coverage. Instead, we will cover his campaign as part of our Entertainment section,\\" they wrote. \\"Our reason is simple: Trump's campaign is a sideshow. We won't take the bait. If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you'll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette.\\" A quick fact-check: 1. Huffington Post is taking the bait, because they're continuing to cover Trump and will continue to benefit from the clicks. 2. Trump's campaign isn't a sideshow. He's leading the field, and is therefore a daily preoccupation for other candidates. (Hours after posting its note, Huffington Post sent an email clarifying that \\"the impact [Trump is] having on the Republican Party and the immigration debate is itself a real thing,\\" which it will cover \\"as substance, but anything that tumbles out of his mouth will land on the Entertainment page.\\") One might conclude that Huffington Post's announcement amounts to the same Trump-style grandstanding they claim to condemn. On a larger level, they seem to miss the point that all politics is theater. Countless statements have tumbled forth from the mouth of candidates -- top-tier and third-tier -- that were made precisely to rile up the base, bait an opponent, get free play in the media, etc. The Huffington Post politics team has covered these stories, and will almost surely continue to do so -- even when they come from candidates who have a less of a shot at their party's nomination than Trump. ||||| Huffington Post: We’re moving our coverage of Trump’s campaign to the entertainment section posted at 1:21 pm on July 17, 2015 by Allahpundit Cute but shortsighted. Do they really want to end up stuck running their stories about President Trump’s inauguration in the sideboob vertical? I like Charlie Spiering’s take: “I’m just shocked that Huffington Post thinks that racist comments about Mexicans are entertaining.” After watching and listening to Donald Trump since he announced his candidacy for president, we have decided we won’t report on Trump’s campaign as part of The Huffington Post’s political coverage. Instead, we will cover his campaign as part of our Entertainment section. Our reason is simple: Trump’s campaign is a sideshow. We won’t take the bait. If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you’ll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette. I’m shocked too. Democrats have been working overtime lately to frame Trump as the face of the Republican Party. The last thing a liberal outfit like HuffPo should want to do now is separate him from the rest of the field by ghettoizing him. There are two camps on this. Camp one: It’s their site, their rules. They’re making a statement about the legitimacy of Trump’s campaign. If they want to photoshop clown make-up onto him in every photo, hey. Camp two: The guy is leading in the polls. He may have no chance at the nomination, but like it or not, he’s part of the landscape of mainstream American politics for the moment. Republican voters should decide who’s a legitimate candidate, not grumpy HuffPo lefties. Their verdict as of July 17th: Among Republican primary voters, Trump captures 18 percent. He’s closely followed by Walker at 15 percent and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 14 percent. No one else reaches double-digits. Support for Trump is up seven percentage points since last month and up 14 points since May. He’s also the candidate GOP primary voters say they are most interested in learning more about during the debates… Trump’s June 16 announcement speech included provocative comments on illegal immigration that people are still talking about a month later, including the suggestion that the Mexican government is sending criminals and rapists to the United States. Whatever the blowback, his views resonate with many: 44 percent of voters think Trump is “basically right” on the issue. A 53-percent majority disagrees. Among Republican primary voters, 68 percent say he is right. HuffPo’s sensitive to the potential problem here. Even if you think the Trump candidacy is a self-aggrandizing distraction, a prank a la Guy Grand being pulled a billionaire who’s in it mainly for the attention and the lulz, the Trump boomlet among GOP voters is a real, fascinating thing. For starters, to their surprise, pollsters have yet to find any unifying demographic variables among Trump voters; they’re not from any particular region of the country or even from any particular wing of the GOP. And Trump, despite his phenomenal fame, has somehow managed to change Republican voters’ impressions of him from highly unfavorable to highly favorable almost overnight by taking an outspoken position on crimes committed by illegal immigrants. Said one pollster to Politico, “I’ve never seen a candidate who’s so well known who was able to suddenly turn around people’s opinions of him.” All of that is a legit political story by any measure. And according to an e-mail from editor Ryan Grim, the Huffington Post agrees: We’re announcing today that from now on we’ll be covering The Donald’s presidential campaign in our Entertainment section. Up until now, we had erroneously been covering him as an actual presidential candidate… Now, the impact he’s having on the Republican Party and the immigration debate is itself a real thing, and we’ll cover that as substance, but anything that tumbles out of his mouth will land on the Entertainment paige [sic]. So Trump goes in entertainment and Trumpmania goes in politics. That’s … awkward, but as a gimmick designed to tickle a lefty readership that loathes Trump to the core (after all he’s done for them), it’s not half bad. Besides, I can’t throw stones: If we end up with a Bush/Clinton election, I’ll be so checked out that every campaign post will be a de facto palate cleanser. Here’s the man himself proving again that he knows what the GOP base wants to hear.

REUTERS/Chris Keane The Huffington Post will no longer cover Donald Trump's presidential campaign in its politics section. In a post published on the site Friday, Huffington Post Washington bureau chief Ryan Grim and editorial director Danny Shea said they would be moving all coverage of Trump, who has starred in multiple reality-television shows, to the entertainment section. \\"Our reason is simple: Trump's campaign is a sideshow,\\" they wrote. \\"We won't take the bait. If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you'll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette.\\" The post was subsequently shared on Twitter by Arianna Huffington, the site's cofounder and editor-in-chief. This decision comes even though The Huffington Post's own poll-tracker shows Trump leading the Republican primary field. In a conversation with Business Insider over Twitter direct messages, Grim explained the rationale behind the decision, described how coverage of Trump would look going forward, and addressed potential criticism of the decision. \\"Yes, that's us passing judgment, but I'd argue it's still objective, as he is objectively a clownshow,\\" Grim said of Trump. According to Grim, Trump will still be included in the site's polls of the 2016 field. Grim said those polls with Trump would still appear in the politics section, \\"as will be his impact on the field, the immigration debate, and politics generally.\\" Business Insider also asked Grim whether the decision to move Trump coverage to entertainment was effectively \\"having it both ways.\\" In other words, The Huffington Post is getting attention and credit for ignoring Trump while still getting traffic from stories about his White House bid on the entertainment section. \\"Yes, though we have always been a mix of high and low,\\" Grim said. \\"All this says is that we're properly classifying him as low.\\" With Trump leading in some polls, Business Insider also asked Grim how The Huffington Post would handle a Trump victory. \\"He will not,\\" Grim said of Trump's chances of becoming the Republican nominee. \\"I'm as likely to get it as he is. He's only where he is because of the big field. When the field winnows, he fades.\\" Trump and his team did not respond to requests for comment on this story. ||||| The Huffington Post has decided wrongly that Donald Trump’s campaign should be stuck closer to its coverage of the Kardashians, U2 or Taylor Swift than of Ted Cruz or Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky: After watching and listening to Donald Trump since he announced his candidacy for president, we have decided we won’t report on Trump’s campaign as part of The Huffington Post’s political coverage.

If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you’ll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette. This is especially dubious in an era where the nexus of entertainment and politics is often quite obvious and growing. One need only look at the dramatic fragmentation in media and how the Obama White House is trying to find niche audiences anywhere it can find them. That means not just going on lots of late-night and soft afternoon talk shows. It means doing garage podcasts and giving “exclusive” interviews to YouTube stars. You might think Trump is a buffoon. But he may have, for the moment at least, touched some nerve of dissatisfaction, perhaps partial explanation of his decent showing in some early Republican polls. Something of the sort happened long ago with some guys who were actually professional actors and were similarly disparaged. They, too, could have been journalistically segregated long ago as not meeting some arbitrary test of seriousness and legitimacy. You do remember Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, don’t you? Yes, the current Trump appeal just might not just be a total function of his celebrity, or his notoriety. It’s possible that something may resonate right now, even if smart Vegas oddsmakers would bet on his ultimate political self-immolation. And then there’s the imminent reality of his being on stage with many other Republican candidates at formal debates. Since you won’t be able to censor in your coverage whatever he says — no matter how dumb — you’ll have to acknowledge his presence. So does that mean you stick his debate comments in the features section? Or does one cover the debate in the news section, then return to segregating coverage of his actual campaign? Yes, the media may now be consigned to a reportorial traffic jam, slowing down and shaking its collective head as it watches the wreck that can seem Donald Trump. But it doesn’t mean you don’t acknowledge the wreck in a fashion that fits the relative support he’s generating. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The Huffington Post announced that they will no longer cover Donald Trump's presidential campaign in its politics section, but will instead cover it in the entertainment section.

The AP notes that Oregonians who knew the amount was getting bumped higher lined up to do their recycling Saturday. Article:","completion":"Title: Oregon Doubles Bottle and Can Deposit to Encourage Recycling Once upon a time, in a land called Oregon, there were many people who bought drinks in bottles and cans. When they finished their drinks, they had empty containers that they needed to get rid of. In Oregon, as well as in nine other special places called \\"states,\\" there was a magical thing called a \\"bottle bill.\\" This meant that when people bought their drinks, they had to pay a little bit of extra money as a \\"deposit\\" on their bottle or can. If they took the empty container back to a special recycling place, they would get that extra money back. This way, the bottles and cans wouldn't end up as trash, but instead could be turned into something new! Most of these states would give back 5 cents for each bottle or can, like getting 5 pieces of candy for every empty container you bring back. But then, Oregon had a great idea: \\"Why not give back more money to help even more people recycle and keep our land clean?\\" So, starting on a special day called Saturday, Oregon decided to double the number of cents they would give back – 10 pieces of candy, or 10 cents, for each bottle and can! This made Oregon the second state to do this, after a place called Michigan. Some other states, like California, also had special offers. If you brought back a really big bottle, like one that could hold 24 ounces, they would give you 10 cents too. And Maine and Vermont even gave back 15 cents, like getting 15 pieces of candy for bigger bottles, like the ones that hold strong drinks for grown-ups, called liquor. As soon as the people from Oregon found out about this change, they were excited to start recycling their bottles and cans. They knew they could help keep the land beautiful and clean, and also get a bit of extra money in return. They lined up, ready to recycle, and make Oregon an even better place to live.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries.

Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz told reporters Thursday that while the storm may be largely over for snow purposes, authorities are exceptionally worried that buildings will collapse when the heavy snow pack soaks up the rain. \\"There's going to be a warm-up on Saturday, there will probably not be a tremendous amount of melt on Saturday,\\" he said. \\"There will be a rain starting on Saturday that will not initially create a situation where the snow will melt, but it will actually act as a sponge. So the water that is falling will go into the snow pack and will actually act as a sponge until it finally starts releasing it.\\" The National Weather Service forecasts light rain to begin Saturday and temperatures to warm. The major concern is flooding, but Poloncarz said the weight on buildings could cause some to collapse. \\"There will be even extra weight because of the rain. So this emergency is not over,\\" he warned. On Thursday afternoon, Erie County officials said there was a \\"significant threat of a roof collapse\\" at the 184-bed Garden Gate Health Care Facility in Cheektowaga. Residents reported wall cracks and a sagging ceiling. Several feet of snow piled on the roof. Poloncarz, who had earlier tweeted that the roof was collapsing, later clarified the statement, saying beams in the building were twisted and walls cracked. No injuries were reported and patients were evacuated. Residents were taken temporarily to a business park, said Scott Zylka with the Erie County Sheriff's Office, adding that the roof structure was compromised. The extreme weather has claimed at least 10 lives -- its latest victims two people with mental health issues who died of apparent exposure overnight, Dr. Gale R. Burstein, Erie County health commissioner, said Thursday. And the storm forced the NFL to announce that Sunday's game between Buffalo and the New York Jets, scheduled to be played at the Bills' Ralph Wilson Stadium, will be hosted at Detroit's Ford Field on Monday night. Seeking shelter. At the Winchester Volunteer Fire Company station on Harlem Street, as many as 40 people stranded in the snow have sought shelter since Tuesday. More than 6 feet of snow cover the streets. Abandoned cars are barely visible under the drifts. Fire trucks can't leave the station. Attempts by firefighters to get out in an SUV were futile. One medic hopped on a snowmobile to rush to a call. Other volunteers jumped on ATVs to reach a home where the roof was buckling under the weight of the snow. Maria Odom's two cats and a dog were rescued from the house. \\"I'm ready for it to end,\\" Odom, 38, said of the extreme weather. \\"I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this.\\" At the fire station, driver Steve Randall's truckload of milk and eggs has served as the main source of provisions. Randall said he was stuck in his truck for nearly five hours before making his way to the firehouse, where people have been sleeping on tables to stay off the cold floor. \\"We've been eating like kings for a while but now we're running out of food,\\" he said. Firehouse occupants have been making quiche, served with milk and bread from a store across the street. From the Tops grocery store nearby, people hauling bags of food headed out into the snow by foot. One man dragged groceries in a sled; another pulled his child through the snow in a laundry basket. Robert Mead embarked on a five-mile trek to bring formula to his 9-month-old baby. A year's snowfall in 3 days? In the past 24 hours, since the latest lake-effect storm started on Wednesday night, more than 3 feet of snow has fallen in several areas near Buffalo. In Wales Center, there was a new snowfall of 37 inches, according to a National Weather Service spotter. Residents just stared out their windows at the mounds of white stuff, if they could see out at all. In East Aurora, Lisa Gutekunst's home was capped with more than 4 feet of snow, she said. \\"The snow is coming down so hard you can't see out the window,\\" she said earlier Thursday. \\"We've cleared our driveway so many times that we've run out of places to put the snow.\\" Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown announced a travel ban in south Buffalo for both cars and pedestrians from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., citing the safety of residents as heavy equipment moved around town. If the forecast holds, more than a year's worth of snow will have fallen in three days. In a typical year, Buffalo's snowfall totals about 7 feet, according to the National Weather Service. Extreme conditions lead to tragedy. Ten people have died, including four who suffered cardiac issues while they shoveled snow and one who died in a car accident, Erie County officials reported. A man in his 60s had a heart attack while he tried to move a snow plow or a snow blower, Erie County deputy executive Richard Tobe said. Burstein told reporters that two residents of Niagara and Erie counties died overnight Thursday of apparent exposure. \\"They both had chronic illnesses,\\" she said. \\"They both had mental health issues, and were found outside either their home or a close friend's home. They had probably been there overnight.\\" In Alden, a 46-year-old man was found dead inside a car buried in 12 to 15 feet of snow. In Genesee County, Jack Boyce, a 56-year-old county employee, died after collapsing Tuesday morning while operating a snow blower outside the county sheriff's office, according to County Manager Jay Gsell. Brown and city officials recounted stories of rescuers trudging around snowdrifts as high as houses to get people to hospitals, and police officers delivering special baby formula to a pair of infants. A sporting chance. Wednesday night's football game between the University of Buffalo and Kent State was postponed because the visitors' equipment truck didn't arrive on time. The game has been tentatively rescheduled for Friday, school officials said in a statement. The National Football League announced it would move Sunday's game from Ralph Wilson Stadium, which was buried in an estimated 220,000 tons of snow. The NFL statement said the contest will be played Monday night at 7 ET at Ford Field, which in 2010 played host to a Minnesota Vikings game after the roof of their stadium collapsed due to snow accumulation. Moving the game back a day will help the Bills, who haven't been able to practice this week. The team had been offering tickets to the game and 10 an hour to anyone willing to help remove the snow. Now it is offering refunds to fans who purchased tickets through the team. CNN's Alexandra Field, Leigh Remizowski, Ashley Fantz, Jason Hanna, Ed Payne, Marcus Hooper, Martin Savidge and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article is about heavy snowfall in the Buffalo area and the problems it is causing.

Turi and Lauper formed a band named Blue Angel and recorded a demo tape of original music. Steve Massarsky, manager of The Allman Brothers Band, heard the tape and liked Lauper's voice. He bought Blue Angel's contract for 5,000 and became their manager. Lauper received recording offers as a solo artist, but held out, wanting the band to be included in any deal she made. Blue Angel was eventually signed by Polydor Records and released a self-titled album on the label in 1980. Lauper hated the album cover, saying that it made her look like Big Bird, but Rolling Stone magazine later included it as one of the 100 best new wave album covers (2003). Despite critical acclaim, the album sold poorly (\\"It went lead\\", as Lauper later joked) and the band broke up. The members of Blue Angel had a falling-out with Massarsky and fired him as their manager. He later filed an 80,000 suit against them, which forced Lauper into bankruptcy. After this Lauper temporarily lost her voice due to an inverted cyst in her vocal cord. After Blue Angel broke up, Lauper spent time, due to her financial problems, working in retail stores, waitressing at IHOP (which she quit after being demoted to hostess when the manager made a pass at her), and singing in local clubs. Her most frequent gigs were at El Sombrero. Music critics who saw Lauper perform with Blue Angel believed she had star potential due to her four-octave singing range. In 1981, while singing in a local New York bar, Lauper met David Wolff, who took over as her manager and had her sign a recording contract with Portrait Records, a subsidiary of Epic Records.

His novels made him famous in his own time, and continue as classics in ours. Dickens began his literary career with almost no formal education. He was born in Landport, on Feb. 7, 1812, the second of eight children. When he was 12, his father was sent to debtor's prison. Dickens was forced to quit school and work in a London blacking factory. He would rework that terrible experience into his fiction for the rest of his life. \\"He was a social reformer,\\" says actor Simon Callow, author of a new biography called Charles Dickens and the Great Theatre of the World. \\"He knew what poverty was. He knew what it was to be rejected, to be cast aside, to live in squalor .\\" And so Dickens wrote with great sympathy for the suffering of innocent and vulnerable children - characters like David Copperfield, Little Dorrit and the orphan, Oliver Twist: With his slice of bread in his hand, and his little brown parish cap on his head, Oliver was now led away from the wretched home, where one kind word or look never lighted the gloom of his infant days. Yet he burst into an agony of childish grief as the cottage gate closed after him. Wretched as were the little companions in,misery he was now leaving behind him, they were the only friends he had ever had. His first book Sketches by Boz came out in 1836. With the appearance of Oliver Twist in London periodicals in 1837, the 25-year-old Dickens became the most popular writer in England. But his first love was theater, and he considered becoming an actor. \\"When he was actually writing, he became his characters,\\" says Peter Ackroyd, author of Dickens: Public Life and Private Passion. \\"He would get up from his desk, go over to the mirror and mouth the words - do the expressions, grimaces , whatever, and then laugh, chuckle to himself, then go back to his desk and write it down.\\" Dickens created 989 named characters, which increased his popularity.... Question: The author quotes Dickens' description of Oliver Twist mainly to show Yes or no, is the answer \\"that Dickens was full of pity for poor children\\"? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the author quotes Dickens' description of Oliver Twist mainly to show that Dickens was full of pity for poor children. This is evident in the excerpt provided, where Dickens writes with sympathy about Oliver Twist's suffering and the emotional pain he feels while leaving the only friends he has ever had. This demonstrates Dickens' understanding of the hardships faced by vulnerable and innocent children, which was fueled by his own experience of poverty and adversity during his youth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brewster (Dennis O'Keefe), a newly discharged U.S. soldier back from fighting in Europe during World War II, rushes home in New York City to marry his sweetheart, Peggy Gray (Helen Walker). However, he has to postpone the wedding after he learns of a strange windfall. His deceased uncle has left him 8 million, but he can inherit the money only if he can spend a million of it before his 30th birthday, only two months away by October 13, 1944, without keeping any assets. The lawyer explains that Brewster's relative hoped it would make him so sick of spending that the rest of the fortune would not be wasted. The conditions include not telling anyone what he is doing. Brewster reluctantly agrees. Brewster sets up his own investment company called Brewster &amp; Company and hires his wartime buddies Hacky Smith (Joe Sawyer) and Noppy Harrison (Herbert Rudley) as vice presidents and Peggy as his private secretary. However, despite his best efforts, most of his schemes to lose money become profitable. Worse, Peggy becomes jealous of Brewster spending a great deal of time with first socialite Barbara Drew (Gail Patrick), then showgirl Trixie Summers (June Havoc), even though he is only using them to help squander the million. Smith and Harrison (mistakingly thinking that Brewster has gone crazy due to his spending sprees), begin to thwart all of his spending schemes. At the same time, Peggy breaks up with Brewster, but her wise mother (Nana Bryant) persuades her to go on a costly cruise with him and the cast of a failed play he financed after Smith and Harrison close it down. During the cruise, Smith and Harrison stage a rebellion by confining Brewster to his quarters and ordering Brewster's chartared yacht turned around to return to New York, thinking that Brewster has lost his mind by financing this pointless cruise. When Brewster's chartered yacht is disabled by a leftover U-boat mine, he escapes from his containment and makes it to the bridge to order the captain to radio for help. Brewster learns...

News article: Cedar Lake Ballet’s Closing Reveals the Perils of Relying on a Single Donor Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet was the envy of many in New York’s dance world: It had a wealthy patron who loved dance, provided good pay and benefits to its dancers, built the troupe a chic Chelsea home and almost single-handedly bore the brunt of the company’s costs. But the perils of relying on a single donor became clear this month when Cedar Lake’s founder and benefactor — Nancy Laurie, a Walmart heiress — had a change of heart and announced that she would close the company after performances in June at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. News of the impending demise of Cedar Lake, which had become known in recent years for introducing European choreographers to America and seemed to have plentiful resources, stunned its fans. Many weighed in on the company’s Facebook page with anguished comments like “This is so sad! I would never have guessed!” and “What happened? I have so many questions...” Ms. Laurie, whose net worth was estimated at 4.5 billion by Forbes, declined an interview request. A spokeswoman for Ms. Laurie, Melissa Nathan, said in a statement: “Over the past decade we have dedicated substantial resources to Cedar Lake. Unfortunately, prevailing circumstances make running Cedar Lake no longer viable in this community.” A review of the dance company’s tax filings showed that for the year ending in July 2013, Ms. Laurie and a foundation she ran provided more than three-quarters of Cedar Lake’s 5.9 million in revenue. Tickets and touring brought in only around 7.6 percent of the company’s revenues — about half of what it made by renting out its West 26th Street home for special events. There were indications that the company had considered trying to broaden its donor base. As recently as October, Cedar Lake had advertised for a manager for external affairs whose duties were to have included developing “multiplatform sponsorship proposals for corporate partners, foundations, government, and individuals.” The position was never filled. Katharine DeShaw, the president of Philanthropology, a philanthropic consulting firm, said that while some nonprofit organizations are created by single donors willing to endow their budgets in perpetuity, many of the strongest are created by single donors who then get like-minded supporters to join in the effort. “I guess the big message here is that whoever that founding donor is, unless they’re willing to put enormous endowments behind their vision, their organizations won’t survive if they don’t invite other people in, and I would argue early in the game,” Ms. DeShaw said. When Ms. Laurie decided to start the company more than a decade ago, she offered dancers an almost unheard-of 52-week contract (even many top ballet companies do not pay their dancers year-round), along with benefits and vacation pay. But the company also raised eyebrows with a system of fining dancers for lateness, changing choreography or missing entrances. Even the company’s debut was unusual. In 2004, Cedar Lake filed a lawsuit against another contemporary ballet company, Complexions, charging that Ms. Laurie had donated 82,500 to Complexions with the understanding that Cedar Lake could make its dance debut at a Complexions performance — only to have Cedar Lake dropped from the program. It is unclear how the lawsuit was resolved; Ms. Laurie’s spokeswoman declined to comment on it, and officials at Complexions did not respond to an email and a phone message seeking comment. The company was initially viewed suspiciously as a rich woman’s whim and got decidedly mixed reviews. But it developed a following in New York and beyond, as it toured extensively, and its studio and dancers were featured in the 2011 film “The Adjustment Bureau,” starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. In 2012, Roslyn Sulcas wrote in The New York Times that it had “become a New York success story, possibly the country’s most innovative contemporary ballet troupe with an A-list repertoire, and an accent on creation that few companies worldwide can match.” But there was internal upheaval in recent years as well. The artistic director who helped establish the company, Benoit-Swan Pouffer, a French-born former member of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, resigned in 2013. The company’s executive director died, and a successor left after a brief tenure. Several company dancers and officials, still employed as they prepare for their final performances in Boston in May and Brooklyn in June, declined to comment on the closing of Cedar Lake. The story of Cedar Lake reminded Ms. DeShaw, the consultant, of another New York dance company: the Harkness Ballet. The Harkness Ballet was created in 1964 by Rebekah West Harkness, a philanthropist who gave millions to dance and to medicine, and who also built a theater for dance on 62nd Street and Broadway. It dissolved after a somewhat rocky decade when Ms. Harkness said she had sustained stock market losses and could no longer support it alone. The Harkness Theater was demolished. Ms. Nathan, the spokeswoman for Ms. Laurie, said that Cedar Lake’s home on West 26th Street, which is owned by the Laurie family, would continue to be rented out for private events.

Answer the following question: Information: - Krum was the Khan of Bulgaria from sometime after 796 but before 803 until his death in 814. During his reign the Bulgarian territory doubled in size, spreading from the middle Danube to the Dnieper and from Odrin to the Tatra Mountains. His able and energetic rule brought law and order to Bulgaria and developed the rudiments of state organisation. - Nikephoros I or Nicephorus I , also Logothetes or Genikos ( Greek : , Nikphoros I , \`\` Bringer of Victory '' ; died July 26 , 811 ) , was Byzantine Emperor from 802 to 811 AD , when he was killed in the Battle of Pliska . A patrician from Seleucia Sidera , Nikephoros was appointed finance minister ( logothets tou genikou ) by the Empress Irene . With the help of the patricians and eunuchs he contrived to dethrone and exile Irene , and to be chosen as Emperor in her stead on October 31 , 802 . He crowned his son Staurakios co-emperor in 803 . His rule was endangered by Bardanes Tourkos , one of his ablest generals , who revolted and received support from other commanders , notably the later emperors Leo V the Armenian and Michael II the Amorian in 803 . But Nikephoros gained over the latter two , and by inducing the rebel army to disperse achieved the submission of Bardanes , who was blinded and relegated to a monastery . A conspiracy headed by the patrician Arsaber had a similar issue . Nikephoros embarked on a general reorganization of the Empire , creating new themes in the Balkans ( where he initiated the re-Hellenization by resettling Greeks from Anatolia ) and strengthening the frontiers . Needing large sums to increase his military forces , he set himself with great energy to increase the Empire 's revenue . By his rigorous tax imposts he alienated the favour of his subjects , and especially of the clergy , whom he otherwise sought to control firmly . Although he appointed an iconodule , Nikephoros as patriarch , Emperor Nikephoros was portrayed as a villain by ecclesiastical historians like Theophanes the Confessor . In 803 Nikephoros concluded a treaty , called the \`\` Pax Nicephori '' , with Charlemagne , but refused to recognize the latter 's imperial dignity . Relations deteriorated and led to a war over Venice in 806 -- 810 . In the process Nikephoros had quelled a Venetian rebellion in 807 , but suffered extensive losses to the Franks . The conflict was resolved only after Nikephoros ' death ,... - The Battle of Pliska or Battle of Vrbitsa Pass was a series of battles between troops, gathered from all parts of the Byzantine Empire, led by the Emperor Nicephorus I Genik, and Bulgaria, governed by Khan Krum. The Byzantines plundered and burned the Bulgar capital Pliska which gave time for the Bulgarians to block passes in the Balkan Mountains that served as exits out of Bulgaria. The final battle took place on 26 July 811, in some of the passes in the eastern part of the Balkans, most probably the Vrbitsa Pass. There, the Bulgarians used the tactics of ambush and surprise night attacks to effectively trap and immobilize the Byzantine forces, thus annihilating almost the whole army, including the Emperor. After the battle, Krum encased Nicephorus's skull in silver, and used it as a cup for wine-drinking. This is one of the best documented instances of the custom of the skull cup. - The Balkan mountain range (Bulgarian and , Latin Serbian Stara planina, \\"Old Mountain\\"; ) is a mountain range in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula. The Balkan range runs 560 km from the Vrashka Chuka Peak on the border between Bulgaria and Serbia eastward through central Bulgaria to Cape Emine on the Black Sea. The highest peaks of the Balkan Mountains are in central Bulgaria. The highest peak is Botev at 2,376 m, which makes the mountain range the third highest in the country, after Rila and Pirin. The mountains are the source of the name of the Balkan Peninsula. - Pliska (, romanized: \\"Plskov\\") is the name of both the first capital of the First Bulgarian Empire and a small town situated 20 km Northeast of the provincial capital Shumen. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - The First Bulgarian Empire (Old ) was a medieval Bulgarian state that existed in southeastern Europe between the 7th and 11th centuries AD. It was founded circa 681 when Bulgar tribes led by Asparukh moved to the northeastern Balkans. There they secured Byzantine recognition of their right to settle south of the Danube by defeating possibly with the help of local South Slavic tribes the Byzantine army led by Constantine IV. At the height of its power, Bulgaria spread from the Danube Bend to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River to the Adriatic Sea.

Review: As a big fan of David Mamet's films and plays, especially his first film House of Games that also starred Joe Mantegna, I was expecting great things from this film. Instead, I found myself annoyed by the film's superficiality and lack of credibility. Racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them, in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized. Identity is totally reevaluated and men become \\"heroes\\" for no apparent reason. Because of his oaths taken as a cop, the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives, and yet performs another action which is very violent and VERY illegal, but then still refuses the minor action. In addition, a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting, and the cop's reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits. Needless to say, after expecting another exciting thriller from David Mamet, I was extremely disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10. What is the sentiment of this review?

Background: Adiabatic cooling occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes a parcel of air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. As the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, water vapor normally condenses to form cloud drops. This condensation normally occurs on cloud condensation nuclei such as salt or dust particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.Frontal and cyclonic lift occur when stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure by a process called convergence. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds over a wide area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of the warm air mass just ahead of the front. Paragraph: A meteorologist is analyzing the weather patterns of two different countries. She notices that all signs indicate that Milshen is experiencing adiabatic cooling. She doesn't see any indications of adiabatic cooling in Limlen, though. This is important information to relay in her broadcast later tonight to the citizens of both countries and she is glad she noticed it. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is the air more or less saturated in Limlen?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, there are no indications of adiabatic cooling happening in Limlen, in contrast to Milshen. Since adiabatic cooling leads to air cooling to its dew point, becoming saturated, and forming cloud drops, we can infer that the air is less saturated in Limlen as compared to Milshen."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"Jon wasted no time.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"No time was wasted by Jon.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"Jon wasted no time,\\" the hypothesis \\"No time was wasted by Jon\\" is indeed true. This statement narrates the same situation from a passive viewpoint. The given premise suggests that Jon performed his tasks efficiently without wasting any time, indicating either his quickitude or proficiency at completing tasks, or that a sense of urgency was attached to the tasks he was performing. The hypothesis, \\"No time was wasted by Jon,\\" underscores the fact that Jon didn't use up any extra time or any time unnecessarily. Again, it narrates the same facts but from a passive perspective. It highlights that no amount of time was used ineffectively or without purpose by Jon. It also implies the thoroughness, swiftness, or promptness with which Jon completed whatever tasks he undertook. The hypothesis thus directly aligns with the premise. It is important to point out that the term \\"wasting time\\" can be quite subjective and is dependent mostly on the context in which it is used. In a general context, however, it means spending time doing unproductive things or activities that do not yield any results. So, in this context, both the premise and the hypothesis convey that Jon refrained from engaging in unproductive activities and utilized his time wisely and efficiently. In conclusion, the premise and the hypothesis carry the same meaning but are stated differently: one is an active sentence while the other is passive.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up.

The reviewer recommends Dr. Abravanel's Body Type Diet instead, describing it in very positive terms. This further underscores their negative view of the Atkins diet.

Despite their usurpation of imperial authority, the Fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy. There was great interest in graceful poetry and vernacular literature. Two types of phonetic Japanese script: katakana, a simplified script that was developed by using parts of Chinese characters, was abbreviated to hiragana, a cursive syllabary with a distinct writing method that was uniquely Japanese. Hiragana gave written expression to the spoken word and, with it, to the rise in Japan's famous vernacular literature, much of it written by court women who had not been trained in Chinese as had their male counterparts. Three late tenth century and early eleventh century women presented their views of life and romance at the Heian court in Kagerō Nikki by \\"the mother of Fujiwara Michitsuna\\", The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon and The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu. Indigenous art also flourished under the Fujiwara after centuries of imitating Chinese forms.

En effet, la mondialisation et l'interdépendance croissante des économies nationales ont rendu ces questions intimement liées. Les enjeux économiques sont essentiels pour comprendre les dynamiques mondiales et les conflits potentiels, car la compétition pour les ressources, les marchés et les avantages économiques peut provoquer des tensions entre les États et les différents acteurs non-étatiques. De plus, la répartition inégale des richesses et l'écart grandissant entre les pays développés et les pays en développement exacerbent les problèmes sociaux et politiques, qui peuvent à leur tour engendrer des conflits. L'environnement et les ressources naturelles sont également au cœur des enjeux contemporains, car leur gestion durable est essentielle pour assurer la prospérité et la stabilité à long terme. La dégradation de l'environnement, la surexploitation des ressources, les changements climatiques et les catastrophes naturelles représentent des défis majeurs pour la sécurité internationale et peuvent aggraver les situations de crise et les tensions préexistantes. Les conflits liés à l'eau, par exemple, sont déjà un problème majeur dans certaines régions, et leur augmentation potentielle avec les changements climatiques pourrait déséquilibrer davantage la paix et la sécurité mondiales. La finance est également un facteur clé dans la préservation de la stabilité internationale et la prévention des conflits.

Article: Tom Sawyer is known as one of the most beloved characters in American literature , but new research found that Mark Twain based this character on his friend named Tom Sawyer. He admired his firefighting friend so much that he gave the character his name. Mark Twain and Tom Sawyer had many adventures together, gambling in Nevada and drinking in pubs. Tom Sawyer once worked as a volunteer firefighter, policeman and customs officer. Before making his way out West, Tom Sawyer used his strength to save 90 people from a burning ship. Mark Twain was particularly moved by this story because his own brother died in a fire while working on a similar steamboat. The two men became friends immediately after meeting in 1863, with Tom Sawyer traveling to Virginia City, while Mark Twain was working as a reporter there. After one night they returned to San Francisco, Mark Twain told his friend that he would base a character in his yet-unwritten book on him. Tom Sawyer said, \\"One day he said to me, 'I'm going to put you between the covers of a book, Tom.' 'Go ahead, Sam,' I Said, 'but don't disgrace my name.'\\" Besides their fondness of drinking, the two men also shared a hobby for storytelling. Tom sawyer believed that it was his anecdotes about his own childhood that inspired Mark Twain to create a book on him. Finally Mark Twain said that the character of Tom sawyer was based on a mix of three real people---John B. Briggs, William Bowen and himself. In spite of this, the historical evidence shows that there might be a fourth, more prominent influencer. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the text? Options: A: Mark Twain wanted to be a firefighter after he knew Tom Sawyer. B: Tom Sawyer saved Mark Twain's life in a terrible fire C: Tom Sawyer's experience inspired Mark Twain to create a work. D: Mark Twain didn't know Tom Sawyer until 1963. The answer to this question is:","completion":"C: Tom Sawyer's experience inspired Mark Twain to create a work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Exhaustion: Procreation, which refers to the act of sexual reproduction, can be physically demanding and result in tiredness for the individuals involved, but this feeling varies from person to person. 2. Feeling good: It's common for individuals to feel pleasure and a sense of satisfaction after engaging in sexual activities due to the release of endorphins; however, this might not be the case for everyone. 3. Having children: Procreation might lead to having children, but this result is not guaranteed after just one sexual event. Also, factors like contraception use, fertility, and chance affect this outcome. 4. Overpopulation: While there is a connection between procreation and population growth, a single act of procreation won't directly cause overpopulation. Overpopulation is a complex issue involving social, economic, and political factors. 5. Hair loss: Hair loss is not directly related to procreation. It is influenced by factors such as genetics, hormones, and lifestyle choices. After evaluating each option, the best answer is: Feeling good.

In mathematics , his most notable contribution is his Oppenheim conjecture . - Ergodic theory (Ancient Greek: \\"ergon\\" work, \\"hodos\\" way) is a branch of mathematics that studies dynamical systems with an invariant measure and related problems. Its initial development was motivated by problems of statistical physics. - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - In number theory, the field of Diophantine approximation deals with the approximation of real numbers by rational numbers. It is named after Diophantus of Alexandria. - A mathematical problem is a problem that is amenable to being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br> It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox. - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - In Diophantine approximation, the Oppenheim conjecture concerns representations of numbers by real quadratic forms in several variables. It was formulated in 1929 by Alexander Oppenheim and later the conjectured property was further strengthened by Davenport and Oppenheim. Initial research on this problem took the number \\"n\\" of variables to be large, and applied a version of the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. The definitive work of Margulis, settling the conjecture in the affirmative, used methods arising from ergodic theory and the study of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups. - In mathematics, a quadratic form is a homogeneous polynomial of degree two in a number of variables.

The sentence is \\"Kürt aydını ve siyasetçi Kemal Burkay, uzun yıllar sürgünde yaşadıktan sonra barış çabalarını daha ileriye taşıma umuduyla ülkesine geri döndü.\\" 3. First, \\"Kürt aydını ve siyasetçi Kemal Burkay,\\" can be translated as \\"Kurdish intellectual and politician Kemal Burkay,\\". I've translated \\"Kürt aydını\\" as \\"Kurdish intellectual\\" because \\"aydın\\" in Turkish refers to an intellectual or enlightened person, and \\"siyasetçi\\" is directly translated to \\"politician\\". 4. Then, \\"uzun yıllar sürgünde yaşadıktan sonra\\" can be translated as \\"after living in exile for many years\\". I translated \\"uzun yıllar\\" as \\"many years\\" and \\"sürgünde yaşadıktan sonra\\" as \\"after living in exile\\". 5. Following this, \\"barış çabalarını daha ileriye taşıma umuduyla\\" can be translated as \\"in the hope of taking his peace efforts further\\". Here, \\"barış çabalarını\\" is translated as \\"his peace efforts\\", \\"daha ileriye taşıma\\" as \\"taking further\\", and \\"umuduyla\\" as \\"in hope of\\". 6. Finally, \\"ülkesine geri döndü\\" can be translated as \\"he returned to his country\\". The phrase \\"ülkesine geri döndü\\" directly translates to \\"returned to his country\\". 7. After translating all the smaller segments, I will now put them together to form a coherent English sentence. 8. The final \`English translation\` of the given \`Turkish sentence\` is: \\"Kurdish intellectual and politician Kemal Burkay returned to his country after living in exile for many years, in the hope of taking his peace efforts further.\\" I have ensured the sentence's grammatical correctness and retained the original meaning of the Turkish text in the English translation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Această afirmație subliniază importanța protejării drepturilor și securității persoanelor care se deplasează sau migrează dintr-o țară în alta. Principiul central în acest context este non-refoulement, care interzice returnarea unei persoane într-o țară în care există un risc serios de persecuție sau de a fi supusă la tratamente inumane, degradante sau la tortură. Acest principiu este consacrat în dreptul internațional al refugiaților, în special Convenția de la Geneva din 1951 și în alte tratate internaționale privind drepturile omului. Pe lângă protejarea individului de riscuri imediate, măsuri precum acestea contribuie, de asemenea, la prevenirea instabilității sociale și a conflictelor în țările în care se întorc persoanele vulnerabile. Acest lucru este esențial pentru a promova conviețuirea pașnică între populații și pentru a asigura respectarea drepturilor fundamentale ale tuturor oamenilor, indiferent de naționalitatea sau originea lor. În acest context, guvernele și organizațiile internaționale au responsabilitatea de a evalua și monitoriza situația din țările terțe la care persoanele se întorc, astfel încât să se asigure că acestea nu vor fi expuse la pericole grave sau tratamente inumane după revenire. Aceasta include cooperarea cu autoritățile din respectivele țări pentru a îmbunătăți condițiile de viață și pentru a combate discriminarea și violența. Totuși, este important de menționat că modalitățile și circumstanțele în care returnarea în țările terțe are loc trebuie să respecte principiile dreptului internațional și al refugiaților. Acest lucru implică, printre altele, garantarea accesului la proceduri adecvate și transparente pentru solicitarea azilului și a protecției internaționale, precum și a dreptului la apel și revizuire judiciară a deciziilor de returnare. În concluzie, nu există niciun motiv justificat pentru a trimite persoanele înapoi în țări terțe în care viața sau persoana lor ar fi în pericol. Este esențial să se respecte principiile dreptului internațional și să se lucreze în colaborare pentru a asigura protecția și siguranța acestor persoane."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

E posibil ca acesta să fie un efect anticipat al acordului de liber schimb? Translate to English English:","completion":"Is it possible that this could be an anticipated effect of the free trade agreement? Translation complete. In response to the question, it is indeed possible that certain effects can be anticipated as a consequence of a free trade agreement (FTA). A free trade agreement refers to a pact between two or more countries with the objective of liberating trade across borders. These agreements typically involve the lowering or complete removal of tariffs, import quotas, and other trade barriers. Some of the anticipated effects may include: 1. Economic growth: FTAs can increase the size of the economies of participating countries by promoting greater trade and investment. Access to larger markets and a wider range of products and services can boost productivity and stimulate growth. 2. Job creation: With increased trade and investment, the demand for labor may rise. Businesses within the FTA may experience growth, creating job opportunities and contributing to improvements in overall employment rates. 3. Lower prices for consumers: The elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers can lead to reduced prices for imported goods. This benefit is passed on to the end consumer, who can now access more affordable products. 4. Increased competitiveness: FTAs can foster competition among businesses by creating a level playing field. This encourages innovation, efficiency, and productivity improvements across industries. 5. Enhanced cooperation and political stability: Free trade agreements can improve cooperation between nations on various fronts, including economic, political, and social aspects. These pacts can act as a catalyst for strengthened diplomatic relationships and increased political stability in the region. However, it is essential to consider that the anticipated effects may not be uniformly positive, and there might be negative consequences as well: 1. Job losses in certain sectors: While FTAs can lead to job creation overall, it may result in layoffs in specific industries, particularly those unable to compete with newly available foreign products. 2. Income inequality: The benefits of increased trade may not be evenly distributed among the population. Higher-income individuals may experience more significant gains, while those in lower-income brackets could struggle with job displacement and limited employment opportunities. 3. Loss of domestic industries: Some industries may struggle to survive due to increased foreign competition, particularly if they rely heavily on government protections, subsidies, or support previously in place. 4. Environmental concerns: Increased industrial activity could lead to environmental degradation, increased pollution, and overexploitation of natural resources. 5. Weakening of labor and environmental standards: To maintain competitiveness, countries may lower their labor and environmental standards to attract foreign investment. This could result in reduced worker protections and potential harm to the environment. In conclusion, an FTA may have both positive and negative anticipated effects. It is crucial to evaluate these potential consequences and ensure that the agreement is implemented in a way that maximizes benefits while minimizing drawbacks for the participating countries and their citizens."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write an article with the title: \\"Chrysler to Offer Free College for All Dealership Employees\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Chrysler to Offer Free College for All Dealership Employees Introduction: Chrysler, the American automobile manufacturer, has recently announced a groundbreaking initiative to offer free college education for all employees working at their dealership locations. In a move that showcases the company's commitment to investing in its workforce, Chrysler has partnered with a network of accredited institutions to provide this unique opportunity for their team members. In this article, we will explore the rationale behind this unprecedented decision and discuss the potential benefits for both the employees and the company as a whole. Step 1: Explaining the Program To launch this ambitious initiative, Chrysler has established partnerships with several accredited colleges and universities across the United States. The program, which is set to roll out in phases, will include access to a wide range of degree programs, including associate, bachelor's, and even master's degrees. Employees interested in pursuing their education will have the flexibility to choose from online, on-campus, or even hybrid (a combination of both) learning options, ensuring that they can balance their work responsibilities alongside their studies. Step 2: Justifying the Investment Chrysler's decision to provide free college education for its dealership employees can be seen as a strategic investment in its workforce. By enabling access to higher education, the company is cultivating a more skilled and knowledgeable base of employees, which can lead to better customer service, improved problem-solving skills, and overall higher employee satisfaction. Additionally, the program serves as a valuable employee retention tool, as workers are likely to be incentivized to remain with the company in the long term, knowing that their educational and career growth is being supported. Step 3: Potential Benefits for Employees For employees, this initiative represents an incredible opportunity to improve their career prospects and personal growth. With the cost of higher education being a deterrent for many individuals, Chrysler's program eliminates this barrier, allowing workers to pursue their educational goals without the burden of student loan debt. Furthermore, the acquisition of new skills and knowledge through higher education can lead to better job security, advancement opportunities within the company, and potentially increased earning potential. Step 4: Impact on the Industry Chrysler's move to offer free college education to dealership employees sets a precedent in the automotive industry, setting the company apart as an industry leader in employee benefits and development. As the news of this program spreads, it is likely that other automakers may follow suit, leading to a shift in the industry that places more emphasis on employee education and training. Ultimately, this may lead to a more competitive market, as companies strive to offer the best support and incentives to attract and retain top talent. Conclusion: In conclusion, Chrysler's initiative to provide free college education to all dealership employees marks a significant milestone in the automotive industry. With a focus on cultivating a knowledgeable and skilled workforce, this program has the potential to transform not only the lives of individual employees but also the landscape of the automotive industry as a whole. As more companies recognize the value of investing in their employees' education and career development, it is likely that we will begin to see a trend towards comprehensive employee support and training within the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A South African farmer is receiving phone calls from his sheep after equipping them with cell phones to keep tabs on the flock amid recent livestock thefts, according to local press Wednesday. When the sheep call, it is always bad news for farmer Erard Louw of the Cape Town suburbs, as the phones around their necks are only set to switch on when the sheep start running, a sign that thieves have cut through the fences. \\"As they run it gives me a phone call and says 'Sheep One' or 'Sheep Two' and so on, so at least I know where to start looking because the farm is 750 hectares (1,850 acres),\\" Louw told the Cape Times daily. Louw attached the phone-like security device to the collars of four sheep in separate flocks after thieves sneaked in and stole 27 sheep and 13 lambs a couple of weeks ago, driving Louw to _ for ways to protect his animals. He said there was no use calling nearby police, as they were stationed too far away and in his experience they either lacked an available car or the vehicle was out of fuel or missing tyres -- also the work of thieves. According to Louw, the cell phones have already proved their worth, with one sheep-snatcher caught thanks to the device. Still, with theft attempts currently at their peak, given long winter nights and early nightfall, a few sheep-robbers managed to get away in spite of the device. \\"The phone did start ringing that night and I went out,\\" he said, but added that he was too late.

The plan suggested the division of the US government into three branches: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branch.

Step 3: Further clarification While accrediting a single individual as the creator of the Virginia Plan, it's worth mentioning that it was a collaborative work. The ideas represented in the Virginia Plan, including the division of the government into three branches, were not unique to Madison. They were common among political thinkers of the time, and the process of drafting the Constitution was a group effort among all the participants of the Constitutional Convention.

The Senate debate could start Tuesday afternoon. And when it does, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and his team will be waiting. In a statement on Sunday night, Mr. McConnell denounced the legislation. “Today’s vote will go down in history as the culmination of a year-long quest by a partisan majority to force its will on the public over bipartisan opposition,” he said. “And it marks the beginning of a backlash against Democrats in Washington who lost their way and lost the trust of the people who elected them.” Mr. McConnell added, “Senate Republicans will now do everything in our power to replace the massive tax hikes, Medicare cuts and mandates with the reforms our constituents have been calling for throughout this debate.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The above article is about the Senate getting ready to talk about the reconciliation bill, which has some changes related to health care and student loans.

The party declined in the 1980s and was close to collapse by 1990. It did not contest the 1984 European Parliament election; it received 1.9% of the vote in Cornwall and West Plymouth in the 1989 election. During this period, the party focussed on its opposition to the creation of a South West England region. It also campaigned against the construction of a nuclear station at Luxulyan and proposals to increase house-building in Cornwall. In 1988, MK established the Campaign for a Cornish Constituency, which won the support of Cornwall County Council, all the district authorities, several Cornish organisations and three of Cornwall's five MPs. The campaign was well-publicised, attained national attention, and collected over 3,000 signatures in three months. Loveday Jenkin was elected its leader in 1990. The party's vote share declined further to 1.5% of the vote in the 1994 European Parliament election, in the new constituency of Cornwall and West Plymouth. In 1996, MK published 'Cornwall 2000 - The Way Ahead', its most detailed manifesto to date.

First, let's analyze the negative sentiment: the user mentions that they \\"cried like a baby tonight\\" and they say \\"I'm sorry.\\" The phrase \\"cried like a baby\\" symbolizes a sense of vulnerability and emotional outpouring. Their apology implies that they might feel embarrassed or guilty for their emotional outburst, although it could also be interpreted as a light-hearted way to express that they had an unexpectedly strong emotional response. As for the stronger positive sentiment in the tweet, the user expresses their enthusiasm and appreciation for the show by stating, \\"the show was aaaaaawesome!\\" The elongated 'a' in \\"aaaaaawesome\\" conveys a heightened sense of excitement and satisfaction. Furthermore, the user claims the event was the \\"best night of my life!\\" which demonstrates a high level of enjoyment and implies that the experience had a significant impact on them. In summary, the sentiment of the tweet is a blend of emotions, with a hint of negative sentiment due to the user's vulnerability and feelings of embarrassment.

Javier Sotomayor Sanabria (] ; born October 13, 1967) is a Cuban former track and field athlete, who specialized in the high jump and is the current world record holder. The 1992 Olympic champion, he was the dominant high jumper of the 1990s; his personal best of 2.45 m (8 ft floor(((2.45)*3.28084)−(floor((2.45)*3.28084)) *12) in) makes him the only person ever to have cleared eight feet. Can we infer the following? in the 1990s the previous record was 2 inches shorter than his jump","completion":"To infer if the previous record was 2 inches shorter than Javier Sotomayor's jump in the 1990s, we need to follow these steps: 1. Convert Sotomayor's record from meters to feet and inches and find the total height cleared. 2. Subtract 2 inches from the previous record and convert it back to meters. 3. Determine if the new height is the previous record. Step 1: Convert Sotomayor's record from meters to feet and inches 2.45 m = 2.45 * 3.28084 = 8.038052 ft Rounding down, he cleared 8 feet and 0.038052 * 12 = 0.456624 inches. So, Sotomayor cleared 8 feet and about 0.46 inches. Step 2: Subtract 2 inches from Sotomayor's record and convert it back to meters 8 ft and 0.46 inches - 2 inches = 8 ft and -1.54 inches (-1.54 because 0.46 - 2 = -1.54) To convert back to meters: 8 feet = 2.4384 meters, and -1.54 inches = -0.03912 meters. Total height in meters: 2.4384 - 0.03912 = 2.39928 meters. Step 3: Determine if the new height is the previous record We cannot conclusively say that the previous record was 2 inches shorter than Sotomayor's jump, as we do not have information on the previous records. We can only calculate that if Sotomayor's record was 2 inches shorter, it would be approximately 2.40 meters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As a result, the cup remained resolutely in its position, its contents undisturbed by the sudden and unexpected turn of events. The afternoon had been calm and peaceful, with individuals enjoying the warm weather while lounging at the outdoor cafe. The sun cast a golden hue over the patio, and the vibrant flowers lining the perimeter seemed to burst with life. Everyone was engaged in easy conversation, savoring the delectable treats and refreshing beverages, oblivious to the impending change in the atmosphere. Unbeknownst to them, a weather front had been moving in from the west, bringing along with it a refreshing yet brisk zephyr. While few had noticed the initial buildup of clouds on the horizon, the gradual increase of the wind speed caught everyone's attention. Napkins and table settings began to flutter, and patrons hastened to secure their belongings. It was amidst this chaos that the fateful event occurred. The umbrella, which had been providing shade to a couple enjoying their leisurely repast, finally met its match in the form of the cool breeze. It was a heavy-duty type, designed to withstand most weather conditions, but not this particularly gusty and forceful wind. Its fabric was unfurled from the spokes, the joints strained, and the entire metal frame groaned under the pressure. And then, with a final desperate heave, the cool breeze tipped the umbrella over. Its fall was dramatic, sending fellow diners into a flurry of surprise and dismay as it plummeted downward, knocking over chairs and tables on its way. The couple, who had managed to escape the umbrella's path of destruction in a timely manner, turned to witness the unfolding scene, their eyes wide with shock. However, as the dust settled and the winds calmed, they noticed an odd yet remarkable sight. Amid the chaos, somehow, the cup they had been sipping from during their meal had remained steadfast. The materials from which it was constructed - ceramic, in this instance - gave it the necessary weight and balance to remain securely planted on the table. Its sturdiness withstood the onslaught of the cool breeze, serving as a testament to its stability and resilience. The couple exchanged a look of disbelief and gratitude, thankful for their good fortune and the fact that their beverage had endured the sudden disturbance. Other diners began to regroup and put things back in order, their conversation turning to the startling events that had momentarily disrupted their pleasant afternoon. Thus, as the waitstaff hastily re-positioned tables and chairs and the patrons assessed the situation, the cup remained a silent and unyielding symbol of the power of design and the resolve of inanimate objects to triumph over the unpredictable forces of nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I applaud the \\"vision\\" of Karl Kopp, I feel he preserved the original architectural elements of the building, while finally catapulting the central Phoenix's bar /restaurant scene into 2008. Finally an upscale restaurant and bar that actually looks like money went into the renovation... Ikea purchased items were not identified here. The main \\"lobby\\" bar/restaurant on the first floor is huge... anchored by a large square bar in the center of the room... the ceiling soars above... a perfect space for an art installation. The room is basically divided into a 60/40 bar/dining area with the main focus on the bar area. Speaking of the bar area... strange place... although the seating at the bar is exceptional, several standard bar features are missing... The standard visual liquor selection is nowhere to be found, and the bartender was at a loss for the choices of vodka. I'm not sure where they bought their martini glasses... they are NOTHING close to the \\"birdbath\\" martini size of AZ88...perhaps someone confused the martini glass order and shipped out eye wash cups... I'm thinking that these are not the standard size and it was all just a very evil joke! (Hint... if you enjoy olives in your martini... order them on the side. Once the spear of olives is removed from the drink, the drink then becomes half empty... exzageration? fabrication? Order one and decide for yourself) Speaking of size..check out the enormous medieval torture device in the center of the bar... oh wait... I'm sorry... it's an industrial size prosciutto slicer.. Silly me. Bevnaps where never used, perhaps they have not been stocked yet?? The restaurant table service was spotty, if not aloof. This type of attitude works great after the restaurant opens and introduces the red rope / bouncer.. my opinion... first learn how to wait on tables, then concentrate on affecting (or should I say...perfecting) the attitude. The \\"deconstructed\\" prosciutto and melon plate we ordered was nothing special, the crisp bread pizza type app was ok.. again, nothing exciting here.

His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"...., what would be the answer ?

PEOPLE Now recently asked several stars to share their unique experiences being bullied or cyberbullied — and how they’ve learned to cope. “The one time in my life I felt like I didn’t fit in was every time I had to move schools,” explained Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi, 46. “I went back and forth a lot between New York and India and it was hard to fit in. Sometimes I got teased. Teased for what I brought to school for lunch, teased for my name, teased for how I looked. It was really hard when you’re growing up and you just want to fit in and be like someone else.” “I can even remember their names — when I was in seventh grade it was Sylvia, when I was in eighth grade it was Patty,” she recalled. “One time somebody crushed an egg on my head and punched in the face — it was horrible. I used to be called giraffe and it just makes you feel so, so alone and so scared.” Former Laguna Beach and The Hills star Kristin Cavallari, 29, said she still deals with bullying every single day on social media. “People always say stuff to me on Instagram and you just have to remember that people who are going to comment [stuff like that], they’re obviously coming from an insecure place,” she said. “When you’re happy with your life and everything’s cool, you’re not going to go and try to put someone else down. So just remember: It’s not about you, it’s about them, and all you have to do is block them and delete the comments.” Disney Channel star Olivia Holt is only 19, but she’s already taught herself to deal with the attacks. “All throughout middle school, it was a really tough time for me,” she confessed. “My middle school was kind of like a high school: cliques here and there, and people talking about each other … and it can get to a point where it’s hurtful, it’s stressful, it’s painful, and sometimes when you get online and you pretend to be somebody you’re not and you say those mean and hurtful things I think you have to think about the other person, and what they might be going through, and what happens behind closed doors. Because I don’t think people think about that before they actually write something that’s going to be hurtful to that person and kind of ruin who they are as an individual.” Victoria Justice, 23, said she experienced bullying in middle school because of her work as an actress. “This girl that I thought I was friends with and that a bunch of my friends were friends with was having her bat mitzvah and she invited everyone except for me,” she recalled. “Another friend of mine asked her why and she said it was because I was on a TV show so I was going to try and ‘steal the spotlight.’ So that was kind of a bummer.” Less Than Perfect star Sara Rue, who said she felt bullied throughout her entire childhood, had some sound advice for anyone experiencing the same struggles. “Kids are mean and I guess what I want to say is it gets better,” she said. “Believe in yourself and find the strength inside you to grow and to become the best person you can be — and don’t let them get you down.”","completion":"\\"Stars Speak Up: Celebrity Experiences and Triumphs Over Bullying and Cyberbullying\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bills began their 2008 campaign at home against the Seattle Seahawks. In the first quarter, Buffalo drew first blood as running back Marshawn Lynch got a 21-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter, the Bills increased their lead with wide receiver/punt returner Roscoe Parrish returning a punt 63 yards for a touchdown. The Seahawks responded with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck completing a 20-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Nate Burleson. Buffalo closed out the half with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 35-yard and a 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Seattle responded with kicker Olindo Mare nailing a 45-yard field goal. Afterwards, Buffalo dug into their bag of tricks. Appearing to attempt a 32-yard field goal, holder Brian Moorman completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to defensive end Ryan Denney. The Bills pulled away with quarterback Trent Edwards completing a 30-yard touchdown pass to tight end Robert Royal. With this win, the Bills started their season with a 1-0 record. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Questions: The boy was too nervous to dance, so what was he doing progressively at the ball? Options: - dance like crazy - standing still - wallflower - stand still - like dancing Answer:","completion":"The boy was too nervous to dance at the ball, so the option that aligns with common sense is that he was acting as a wallflower. A wallflower is a term used for someone who attends a social event but prefers to stay on the sidelines, avoiding active participation. In this case, the boy was too nervous or shy to dance and engage in the festivities, so he chose to remain on the periphery of the event. While standing still or standing still may also be considered valid options, the term \\"wallflower\\" is more descriptive and precise in capturing the boy's disposition and behavior at the ball. This term better illustrates his reluctance to dance and indicates that he was not merely standing still, but also avoiding participation in the event due to his nervousness. Dancing like crazy or like dancing are not suitable options since they contradict the premise of the boy being too nervous to dance. These options would imply that the boy overcame his nerves and engaged in the dancing activities wholeheartedly, which is not the situation presented in the question."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Cellar: A cellar is usually a room beneath a house or building, typically used for storage. It is not highly unusual to put a furnace in a cellar, as it can provide a central location for heating the building. 2. Encampment: An encampment is a temporary or semi-permanent outdoor living area, typically made up of tents or similar structures. It is highly unusual to put a furnace in an encampment, as furnaces are usually found in permanent structures and require a stable power source or fuel supply. 3. House: Houses are living dwellings, and it is common for furnaces to be installed in them for heating purposes. 4. Basement: Similar to a cellar, a basement is a space beneath a house or building. It is not highly unusual to have a furnace in a basement, as it can be a practical location for heating the building. 5. Home: A home is a dwelling where people live, much like a house. It is not highly unusual for a furnace to be installed in a home. In conclusion, comparing all of these options, it is highly unusual to put a furnace in an encampment. This is because furnaces are associated with permanent structures and require a stable power source or fuel supply, which is not typically found in a temporary or semi-permanent living area.

Paragraph: BACKGROUND: Despite the high risk for patient harm during unanticipated ICU evacuations, critical care providers receive little to no training on how to perform safe and eff ective ICU evacuations. We reviewed the pertinent published literature and off er suggestions for the critical care provider regarding ICU evacuation. Th e suggestions in this article are important for all who are involved in pandemics or disasters with multiple critically ill or injured patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government offi cials. Th e Evacuation and Mobilization topic panel used the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Guidelines Oversight Committee's methodology to develop seven key questions for which specifi c literature searches were conducted to identify studies upon which evidence-based recommendations could be made. No studies of suffi cient quality were identifi ed. Th erefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modifi ed Delphi process. RESULTS: Based on current best evidence, we provide 13 suggestions outlining a systematic approach to prepare for and execute an eff ective ICU evacuation during a disaster. Interhospital and intrahospital collaboration and functional ICU communication are critical for success. Pre-event planning and preparation are required for a no-notice evacuation. A Critical Care Team Leader must be designated within the Hospital Incident Command System. A threestage ICU Evacuation Timeline, including (1) no immediate threat, (2) evacuation threat, and (3) evacuation implementation, should be used. Detailed suggestions on ICU evacuation, including regional planning, evacuation drills, patient transport preparation and equipment, patient prioritization and distribution for evacuation, patient information and tracking, and federal and international evacuation assistance systems, are also provided. CONCLUSIONS: Successful ICU evacuation during a disaster requires active preparation, participation, communication, and leadership by critical care providers. Critical care providers have a professional obligation to become better educated, prepared, and engaged with the processes of ICU evacuation to provide a safe continuum of critical care during a disaster.

We suggest local and regional mutual-aid agreements should be established with other appropriately staff ed and resourced hospitals to redistribute critically ill and injured patients from an evacuating hospital(s), and these agreements should be integrated within the framework of disaster preparedness plans. 1b. We suggest creation of predisaster formal agreements between hospitals and transport agencies or between Health Coalitions or Regional Health Authorities and transport agencies for air or ground transport of critically ill patients during a disaster. Prepare for and Simulate Critical Care Evacuation 2a.

Disease-causing fungi are parasitic. Recall that parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship between organisms of different species in which one, the parasite, benefits from a close association with the other, the host, which is harmed. I am facing a new situation today: Bill and Larry did some research on fungi. Larry researched saprophytic fungi, while Bill researched parasitic fungi. They later exchanged findings. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which researcher learned less about fungi that get their nutrients from their host? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, it can be inferred that Larry, who researched saprophytic fungi, learned less about fungi that get their nutrients from their host. Saprophytic fungi obtain their nutrients by breaking down and absorbing nutrients from dead or decaying organic matter, while parasitic fungi, as mentioned in the background article, live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. Since the question specifically asks about fungi that get their nutrients from their host, we can conclude that Bill, who researched parasitic fungi, learned more about this type of fungi compared to Larry. Consequently, Larry, who focused on saprophytic fungi - which do not primarily rely on a living host to obtain nutrients - learned less about fungi that get their nutrients from their host."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You see, Donald wanted to be the boss of another big and important country called the United States, but he said some things that upset and scared many people in the UK. These people felt so strongly that they started to really, really not want Donald Trump to visit their country. So they decided to do something about it. Now, in this big country, there's a group of special people called \\"MPs\\" who make and talk about rules and laws to help their country. They meet in a special place called \\"the Parliament.\\" When the people of the United Kingdom wanted their voices to be heard, they made a special kind of letter, called a \\"petition.\\" They got many, many signatures on the petition – more than 370,000! This made it so important and big that the MPs had to pay attention and talk about it. Since so many people signed the petition, the MPs will have to think about whether or not to let Donald Trump come to their country. They will have a big talk about it, called a \\"debate,\\" to decide what to do. The end of this story has not yet been written, but the people who started the petition and all those who signed it are hoping that their voices will be heard and that their wishes will come true.

Lots of stores and supermarkets sell DIY things. TV programs show people how to DIY. English people like DIY. There is a saying in UK---\\"An Englishman's home is his castle\\". Huge numbers of people spend their holidays making their homes beautiful \\"castles\\". If there is anything that needs fixing around their houses, such as painting the walls or putting in a new shower, they will do the jobs themselves. They share DIY experiences with their friends. More and more people have discovered the joy of DIY. Sometimes people also DIY for saving money. With the economic downturn at present, many people can not afford to buy a bigger house. They are looking at how they can make their houses better without spending a lot of money. It is not surprising that DIY is so popular. DIY can be difficult. There is a huge market for DIY furniture which people need to put together themselves with a few basic tools . However, people often find it not easy to build a piece of furniture because they can't understand the instructions. Sometimes the instructions are simple and clear, but the furniture itself is difficult to build. One thing is for sure, though most DIY projects are started with the best intentions (,), many of them may not get finished. DIY can also be dangerous. For example, anything electrical should be done by a professional worker. Unluckily, many people don't care about this warning and put themselves in danger. It is reported that in just one year over 230 000 people were hurt while doing DIY in UK, including 41 000 who fell off ladders . Therefore, DIY can bring us fun and help us save money, but it is not always as easy as it is thought to be if _ . Maybe factories should make products that are easier and safer for us to DIY. Question: Why do English people like DIY ? - Many stores sell DIY things. - DIY can bring them fun. - TV programs teach them to DIY. - All DIY projects are easy. Answer:","completion":"English people like DIY for a variety of reasons, as indicated in the article.

Additionally, DIY can also help them save money, particularly during economic downturns, as they look for ways to improve and maintain their homes without spending a lot on professional services. Lastly, the article points out that the popularity of DIY may be influenced by the availability of DIY materials in stores and supermarkets, as well as TV programs that teach people how to do DIY projects.

Some radio stations use the term to distinguish themselves from classic rock, which tend more towards 1960s-1980s rock music. - Alternative Songs (also called Alternative and formerly known as Modern Rock Tracks and Hot Modern Rock Tracks) is a music chart in the United States that has appeared in \\"Billboard\\" magazine since September 10, 1988. It lists the 40 most-played songs on modern rock radio stations, most of which are alternative rock songs. The chart was introduced as a companion to the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and its creation was prompted by the explosion of alternative music on American radio in the late 1980s. - Viacom, Inc. (known simply as Viacom) is an American media conglomerate with interests primarily in cinema and cable television. It is currently the world's sixth largest broadcasting and cable company in terms of revenue, behind Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, Time Warner, 21st Century Fox and CBS Corporation, respectively. Voting control of Viacom is held by National Amusements, Inc., a privately owned theater company controlled by the billionaire Sumner Redstone. Redstone also holds via National Amusements a controlling stake in CBS Corporation. - A Weekend in the City is the second studio album by British indie rock band Bloc Party. It was recorded at Grouse Lodge Studios in Westmeath, Ireland, in mid-2006 and was produced by Jacknife Lee. The album was refined and mixed at several locations in London at the end of 2006.

The album peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and on the Irish Albums Chart. In the United States, it entered the \\"Billboard\\" 200 at number 12. - Wichita Recordings is an independent record label located in London, founded in 2000 by Mark Bowen and Dick Green. Its most notable signees include Bloc Party, The Cribs, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Bright Eyes, My Morning Jacket, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Best Coast, Los Campesinos! and Peter Bjorn and John.

The song was later re-recorded for the band's 2005 debut album \\"Silent Alarm\\", while \\"The Marshals Are Dead\\" was re-recorded and released on the 7\\" and DVD single versions of the \\"So Here We Are\\" single. - BBC Radio 1 is a British radio station operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation which also broadcasts internationally, specialising in modern and current popular music and chart hits throughout the day. Radio 1 provides alternative genres after 7:00 pm, including electronic dance, hip hop, rock, indie or interviews. It is aimed primarily at the 1529 age group, although the average age of the UK audience in 2008 was 33. BBC Radio 1 started 24-hour broadcasting on 1 May 1991. - MTV2 (formerly M2) is an American digital cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Global Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom. The channel was initially broadcast over-the-air in selected markets, where the former all-request music channel known as The Box was broadcast. The channel was originally launched as a constant commercial-free music video channel, much like the original MTV channel; but once MTV started to change its focus from music to reality television in the 2000s, MTV2's focus changed as well, thus bringing music video programming away from both MTV and MTV2. Today, MTV2 broadcasts unscripted programming and syndicated television episodes from MTV and other networks. - Satellite television is according to \\"article 1.39\\" of the International Telecommunication Unions (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) a \\"Broadcasting-satellite service\\". - A music video is a short film integrating a song and imagery, produced for promotional or artistic purposes. Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. There are also cases where songs are used in tie in marketing campaigns that allow them to become more than just a song. Tie ins and merchandising could be used in toys or marketing campaigns for food and other products. Although the origins of music videos date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s, they came into prominence in the 1980s when MTV based their format around the medium. Prior to the 1980s, these works were described by various terms including \\"illustrated song\\", \\"filmed insert\\", \\"promotional (promo) film\\", \\"promotional clip\\", \\"promotional video\\", \\"song video\\", \\"song clip\\" or \\"film clip\\". Since the creation and increased popularity of YouTube, mainstream artists now promote new music videos by releasing trailers of short promos on the site for their upcoming song and music video. Consequentially, YouTube has been converted into a social media platform for celebrities and artists to market themselves to their fans - New Musical Express (NME) is a British music journalism magazine published since 1952. It was the first British paper to include a singles chart, in the edition of 14 November 1952. In the 1970s it became the best-selling British music newspaper. During the period 1972 to 1976, it was particularly associated with gonzo journalism, then became closely associated with punk rock through the writings of Julie Burchill, Paul Morley and Tony Parsons. It started as a music newspaper, and gradually moved toward a magazine format during the 1980s and 1990s, changing from newsprint in 1998. - Viacom Media Networks (formerly MTV Networks) is an American mass media division of Viacom that oversees the operations of many of its television channels and Internet brands, including Nickelodeon, BET, CMT, Comedy Central, VH1 and the original MTV channel in the United States. Its sister international division is Viacom International Media Networks. - Gordon Peter Moakes (born 22 June 1976) is an English musician, best known as the bassist of rock band Young Legionnaire and former member of indie rock band Bloc Party. - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. - Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents supposedly unscripted real-life situations, and often features an otherwise unknown cast of individuals who are typically not professional actors, although in some shows celebrities may participate. It differs from documentary television in that the focus tends to be on drama, personal conflict, and entertainment rather than educating viewers. The genre has various standard tropes, including \\"confessionals\\" (also called \\"talking heads\\" or \\"interview segments\\") used by cast members to express their thoughts, which often double as the shows' narration. In competition-based reality shows, a notable subset, there are other common elements such as one participant being eliminated per episode, a panel of judges, and the concept of \\"immunity from elimination.\\" - Digital cable is any type of cable television distribution using digital video compression for USE. The technology was originally developed by General Instrument before being acquired by Motorola and subsequently acquired by ARRIS Group. Cable companies converted to digital systems during the 2000s, around the time that television signals were converted to the digital HDTV format, which was not compatible with earlier analog cable systems. In addition to providing higher resolution HD video, digital cable systems provide expanded services such as pay-per-view programming, cable internet access and cable telephone services. Most digital cable signals are encrypted, which reduced the high incidence of cable theft which occurred in analog systems. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - The UK Albums Chart (currently called the Official Albums Chart) is a list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015) audio streaming in the United Kingdom. It was published for the first time on 22 July 1956 and is compiled every week by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on Fridays (previously Sundays). It is broadcast on BBC Radio 1 (top 5) and published in \\"Music Week\\" magazine (top 75), and on the OCC website (top 100). - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Bloc Party are an English indie rock band, currently composed of Kele Okereke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, sampler), Russell Lissack (lead guitar, keyboards), Justin Harris (bass guitar, keyboards, saxophones, backing vocals) and Louise Bartle (drums, percussion). Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in \\"NME\\" magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer, Alex Kapranos, a copy of their demo \\"She's Hearing Voices\\". - The Irish Albums Chart is the Irish music industry standard albums popularity chart issued weekly by the Irish Recorded Music Association and compiled on its behalf by Chart-Track. Chart rankings are based on sales, which are compiled through over-the-counter retail data captured electronically each day from retailers' Point of sale systems and certain digital retailers. All major record stores and over forty independents submit data for the charts, accounting for over 80% of the market, according to Chart-Track. A new chart is compiled and released to the public by the Irish Recorded Music Association on Friday at noon. Each chart is dated with the \\"week-ending\\" date of the previous Thursday (i.e., the day before issue). - House music is a genre of electronic music created by club DJs and music producers that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s. Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Frankie Knuckles, Phuture, Kym Mazelle, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia. - YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. The service was created by three former PayPal employeesChad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karimin February 2005. In November 2006, it was bought by Google for US1.65 billion. YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries. The site allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to favorites, report and comment on videos, and it makes use of WebM, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media videos. Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music videos, short and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers and other content such as video blogging, short original videos, and educational videos.

The keys are \\"name\\", \\"food\\", and \\"customer_rating\\", while their corresponding values are \\"The Eagle\\", \\"English\\", and \\"low\\". A dictionary is an efficient and easily accessible data structure in many programming languages. Alternatively, you can represent the data using a tuple or a list: restaurant_info_tuple = (\\"The Eagle\\", \\"English\\", \\"low\\") restaurant_info_list = [\\"The Eagle\\", \\"English\\", \\"low\\"] In both the tuple and list representations, you would need to remember the indices for respective details (e.g., 0 for the name, 1 for the food type, and 2 for the customer rating). You can choose the data structure based on your specific needs and the programming language you are working with. For most simple applications, a dictionary with clear key-value pairs will work well for the given sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who visits Mrs. Rudge in a psychiatric home? Title: Full Circle Movie plot: As Julia Lofting (Mia Farrow) eats breakfast with her family, her daughter Kate (Sophie Ward) begins to choke on her food. Unable to dislodge the food, Julia attempts to save her by performing a tracheotomy which results in the child's bleeding to death. Julia leaves her husband Magnus (Keir Dullea) and moves to a new house with an upstairs room containing a child's possessions, including a mechanical clown toy with sharp cymbals on which she cuts her finger. In the park, Julia sees a young girl that she believes is Kate but the child disappears. Unusual things happen to take place in the house such as strange noises and appliances turning on by themselves. Later, Julia again sees the girl in the park and finds a mutilated turtle and knife where she stood. Julia lets Magnus' sister Lily use her house to conduct a seance. Mrs. Flood, the medium, explains that spirits need to control someone to carry out physical acts. During the seance, the medium becomes frightened and tells Julia to leave the house immediately. Moments later, one of Lily's friends falls down the stairs before Mrs. Flood can explain what she saw. While Julia is out, Magnus breaks into her house. He sees something and follows it to the basement where he falls from the staircase, fatally cutting his throat on a broken bottle. A neighbor tells Julia the house once belonged to Heather Rudge, who moved away after her daughter Olivia died. Julia visits Mrs. Flood who tells her that during the sÃ©ance she had a vision of a boy in the park, bleeding to death. Julia finds an article about Geoffrey Braden, a young boy who was murdered in the park. Julia visits Geoffrey's mother, Greta Braden, who says a vagrant was executed for the crime but other children in the park murdered her son. She says she and her companion have been following the lives of the children. She asks Julia to visit the remaining two, now adults: Captain Paul Winter and David Swift.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Polls show Ohio remains elusive for Romney as GOP ticket wraps up bus tour That’s an even wider margin than in Tuesday’s Washington Post poll, which showed Obama taking 52 percent to Romney’s 44 percent among Ohio’s likely voters. Why has the Buckeye State so eluded Romney in his bid for the White House? Part of the trouble for Romney is that Obama has showered the state with money and attention over his nearly four years in office. The president’s visit to Bowling Green and Kent on Wednesday marked his 13th trip to the state this year and his 29th since taking office, and either Obama or Biden has visited Ohio an average of once every three weeks since they were inaugurated in 2009. Romney, who was wrapping up a two-day bus tour in the state Wednesday, has visited Ohio 17 times during the 2012 cycle, including 10 trips since May, according to his campaign. Ryan (Wis.) has headlined more than half a dozen events in the state since being tapped last month to serve as Romney’s running mate, making it his most-visited state. Romney has also been overshadowed by Obama when it comes to TV ad spending in the state. According to a National Journal tally, Obama’s campaign had spent nearly 41 million on TV ads in Ohio from May 1 to early September, compared with nearly 21 million for Romney. Romney has been given a boost by a combined 21 million spent by GOP-aligned outside groups, including Crossroads GPS, Restore Our Future, American Future Fund and Americans for Prosperity, as well as an additional 2.8 million spent by the Republican National Committee. But in Ohio as in other states, it appears that the impact of that super PAC spending has fallen short of expectations. Obama, too, has gotten a lift in Ohio in the form of nearly 7 million worth of TV ads aired by the Democratic-leaning super PAC Priorities USA Action. The polls released this week indicate that the Obama campaign has outmaneuvered the Romney camp in terms of its get-out-the-vote operation: Thirty-six percent of registered voters in Ohio polled by The Washington Post said they had been contacted by the Obama campaign, compared with 29 percent who had been contacted by the Romney campaign. The gulf in Ohio was wider than in Virginia or Florida, the two other battleground states polled. The new surveys show Romney at a disadvantage against Obama on several issues and among key groups of Ohio voters. Sixty-four percent of registered Ohio voters polled by The Washington Post said they viewed the federal government’s bailout of the auto industry, which Romney opposed, as “mostly good.” Romney has also lost ground to Obama on the matter of how he would handle the economy: In Wednesday’s Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News survey, 51 percent of likely Ohio voters said Obama would do a better job, compared with 45 percent who said the same of Romney; last month, the candidates were tied on the issue. And while Obama’s favorability ratings appear to have held steady among Ohio voters, unfavorable views of Romney have ticked upward in the past four months. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist University poll released this month showed that 51 percent of registered Ohio voters have an unfavorable view of Romney, up from 47 percent in May. Obama is viewed unfavorably by 44 percent — on par with where he stood in May — and favorably by 51 percent. Ohio is not the only swing state in which polls have consistently shown Romney at a disadvantage, although with 18 Electoral College votes, it is one of the largest. In New Hampshire and Nevada, Romney has not led Obama in a single nonpartisan poll since winning the GOP nod. In Virginia and Colorado, Romney has led in just a handful. Romney’s camp has downplayed its deficit in public polls; the campaign’s national political director, Rich Beeson, told reporters Tuesday that “the ground game is good for a field goal” and that “if you’re within three points, it can make a difference.” Even so, with early voting in Ohio set to begin Oct. 2, the Romney-Ryan ticket has little time to waste in working to make up ground. Summary:","completion":"Recent polls show Obama leading Romney in Ohio, with a significant gap in favorability ratings. Obama has showered the state with money and attention, visiting more frequently and outspending Romney on TV ads. The Obama campaign has also outperformed the Romney campaign in terms of its get-out-the-vote operation in Ohio. Romney has lost ground to Obama on key issues, such as the auto industry bailout and handling the economy. With early voting starting on October 2, Romney and Ryan have limited time to make up ground in this crucial swing state."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: One of the worst feelings you have as a professional athlete is the feeling after losing a game to a team that you should have beaten. That happened last night against the lowly Boston Celtics. They had only won 13 games the whole year and were really struggling. We had just come off a very good win against the Orlando Magic on the road and were feeling good about ourselves. The day did not start out good for us when we learned that T-Mac was going to miss the game with the flu. When you lose your best players (Yao, T-Mac) everyone must play a little harder and do a little bit more on the floor. We inserted Bonzi Wells into the lineup (he was the only one to have a good game for us), in place of T-Mac. It was a nasty game. We are usually one of the best three point shooting teams in the NBA and we only made 1 of 22 three point shots! I have never seen that happen. Never! Rafer Alston, Luther Head, and me combined to shoot 5 of 33 from the field. Ouch! You aren't going to win too many games like that. Even as poorly as we shot the ball, we STILL had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but failed to make the winning plays that you must make to leave the floor victorious. In the locker room after the game, everybody felt terrible. When we play a bad game, we feel that we let our teammates down. There is a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach when you leave the gym and you just want to go home and not talk to anyone. It is a terrible feeling, but it is a feeling that makes you want to try harder and do better the next time. I'll talk to you guys later.

To simplify, we can combine the terms that include n on the right side of the equation. -1394*n - 1922*n = (-1394 - 1922)*n = -3316*n The equation now becomes: -436*n + 48960 = -3316*n Step 2: Isolate n To find the value of n, we want to isolate it on one side of the equation. To achieve this, we can start by adding 436*n to both sides of the equation to eliminate n from the left side. -436*n + 436*n + 48960 = -3316*n + 436*n The equation becomes: 48960 = -2880*n Step 3: Divide both sides by the coefficient of n Now, to solve for n, we can simply divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of n, which is -2880. 48960 / -2880 = n Step 4: Simplify and find the value of n Finally, we can perform the division to find the value of n: n = -17 So, the answer is n = -17."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: What process allows plants to convert light energy into sugars and energy for food? A: Answer:","completion":"The process that allows plants to convert light energy into sugars and energy for food is known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a fundamental process for plant growth, as well as the primary energy source for most living organisms on Earth. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight (light energy) along with carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and water (H2O) from the soil. These elements are combined within the chlorophyll-containing cells of plant leaves called chloroplasts. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, is responsible for capturing light energy, which is then used to power a set of chemical reactions. Photosynthesis can be divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). 1. Light-dependent reactions: These reactions occur in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast and require light energy. When sunlight hits the chlorophyll, it energizes electrons, which then move through a series of membrane proteins called the electron transport chain. This movement generates ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), two energy-rich molecules used in the next stage. 2. Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle): These reactions occur in the stroma of the chloroplast and do not require light energy. During the Calvin cycle, CO2 from the atmosphere is fixed, and the chemical energy stored in ATP and NADPH is used to produce glucose (a sugar) and other organic compounds. These sugars and compounds serve as the primary food source for plants and, indirectly, for most other living organisms. In summary, photosynthesis enables plants to convert light energy into chemical energy stored in the form of glucose and other organic molecules, which serve as essential nutrients for both plants and various other life forms. This process plays a crucial role in maintaining life on Earth and maintaining the balance of atmospheric gases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering What will Remy want to do next? Possible answers: 1. fix the car. 2. go on a long road trip. 3. ignore the sound.","completion":"Based on the given situation, it seems that Remy has noticed that their car's engine is making a strange rumbling noise. Given this issue, the most logical next step to avoid further damage or issues with the car would be option 1: to fix the car. Remy would likely want to take the car to a garage or an automotive technician to have it evaluated and determine the cause of the strange rumbling sound. Depending on the severity or cause of the issue, they may need to have the car repaired before considering other options like going on a long road trip or ignoring the sound. Ignoring the sound (option 3) might lead to more significant issues with the car or even dangerous driving conditions. Going on a long road trip (option 2) without addressing the issue might not be the safest or most responsible choice, as the car's engine could potentially break down during the trip resulting in inconvenience or danger for both Remy and other road users."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The task is to check the validity of the answer. Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". Input: Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans. E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\" <sep>What might be two characteristics that would appeal to smokers who wish to quit?<sep>They are flavored, have the nicotine but do not have the smoke Output:","completion":"Yes"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

At what point will technology allow for women to establish, develop, DEFEND, and maintain their own civilisation? How low will China allow its reserves to fall? At what point will it just give up and stop defending its currency? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"The two questions posed are fundamentally different, focusing on separate topics: the advancement of women and the development of their own civilization, and China's economic decisions regarding its currency reserves. Let's examine each question in detail. 1. At what point will technology allow for women to establish, develop, DEFEND, and maintain their own civilization? The concept of a separate civilization exclusively comprised of women is not solely dependent on technology but also on social, political, and cultural factors. However, technology indeed plays a significant role in empowering women and could contribute to the establishment and development of such a civilization, though some challenges remain. A few ways in which technology can serve women in this regard include: - Education: Access to technology and the internet allows women to gain knowledge, develop skills, and pursue higher education, promoting self-reliance and economic independence. - Healthcare: Technological advancements in healthcare have enabled women to take greater control over their reproductive rights and overall health, leading to an improvement in their quality of life. - Security: As emerging technologies become more sophisticated, women can utilize them for self-defense and protection against violence or external threats. Additionally, AI surveillance and security systems can help safeguard communities and maintain order. - Communication: Social media platforms, messaging apps, and other tools offer women a way to connect, network, and collaborate. This aids in organizing and forming movements, sharing resources, and working together for the establishment of a new civilization. - Governance: E-governance tools, online decision-making platforms, and transparent channels of communication with citizens would allow women to establish democratic systems and maintain order in their civilization by enabling participation and accountability. However, it's essential to address existing gender-related biases and barriers in technology access, usage, and application. This involves promoting digital literacy and inclusivity, addressing cyber harassment and online violence, and ensuring that technology serves rather than marginalizes women. Ultimately, the creation of a women-only civilization depends on a variety of factors, with technology playing a supportive role in enhancing their capacities and opportunities. 2. How low will China allow its reserves to fall? At what point will it just give up and stop defending its currency? China's foreign exchange reserves and its management are primarily determined by its economic policies, the health of its domestic economy, and the global economic environment. As the world's largest foreign exchange reserves holder, China carefully manages its reserves to maintain its economy's stability and currency value. The decision to stop defending its currency or allowing reserves to fall is highly complex and not easily predicted. There are several factors that could influence China's decision, including: - The foreign exchange reserves' adequacy in terms of import coverage, external debt, and in relation to GDP. - The willingness to allow the currency to appreciate or depreciate against other currencies, mainly the US Dollar, considering its impact on domestic and international trade. - The balance between defending the currency and maintaining macroeconomic stability, which involves interest rates, inflation, and employment. - The global economic environment and the capital flows into and out of China, which may force them to intervene in the currency markets to control excess volatility. China would only stop defending its currency if it deems reserves inadequate for managing economic stability or if the domestic financial system can withstand fluctuations without compromising the nation's economic goals. However, predicting a specific threshold is difficult due to the multitude of factors involved. In conclusion, the two questions differ considerably in the subject matter and the factors that influence them. The first question focuses on the role of technology in empowering women and facilitating the creation of a women-led civilization, while the second question delves into China's strategic economic decisions and its management of foreign currency reserves."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Long long ago, an old scientist made a few tests on different animals to find out which was the cleverest of all the animals.

Answer the following question: Information: - A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms. - Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, an ideal \\"intelligent\\" machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term \\"artificial intelligence\\" is applied when a machine mimics \\"cognitive\\" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as \\"learning\\" and \\"problem solving\\". As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar of \\"artificial intelligence\\", having become a routine technology. Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as Chess and Go), self-driving cars, and interpreting complex data. Some people also consider AI a danger to humanity if it progresses unabatedly. - Prolog is a general-purpose logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. - Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages according to the style of computer programming. Features of various programming languages determine which programming paradigms they belong to; as a result, some languages fall into only one paradigm, while others fall into multiple paradigms. Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar. - Carcassonne is a fortified French town in the Aude department, of which it is the prefecture, in the Region of Occitanie. - Datalog is a declarative logic programming language that syntactically is a subset of Prolog. It is often used as a query language for deductive databases. In recent years, Datalog has found new application in data integration, information extraction, networking, program analysis, security, and cloud computing. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - A computer scientist is a scientist who has acquired the knowledge of computer science, the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their application. - Logic programming is a type of programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Major logic programming language families include Prolog, Answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of \\"clauses\\": - Aude is a department in south-central France named after the river Aude. The local council also calls the department \\"Cathar Country\\". Aude is also a frequent feminine French given name in Francophone countries, deriving initially from Aude or Oda, a wife of Bertrand, Duke of Aquitaine, and mother of Saint Hubertus's brother Eudo. Aude was the name of Roland's fiancée in the chansons de geste. - Answer set programming (ASP) is a form of declarative programming oriented towards difficult (primarily NP-hard) search problems. It is based on the stable model (answer set) semantics of logic programming. In ASP, search problems are reduced to computing stable models, and \\"answer set solvers\\" programs for generating stable modelsare used to perform search. The computational process employed in the design of many answer set solvers is an enhancement of the DPLL algorithm and, in principle, it always terminates (unlike Prolog query evaluation, which may lead to an infinite loop). - Alain Colmerauer ( born 24 January 1941 , Carcassonne ) is a French computer scientist and the creator of the logic programming language Prolog . - Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective.

It has something to do with how people produce food: growing it on the farm, processing it in factories, and making it ready for you to eat. Here's what happens: Most farmers use chemicals to stop their crops from getting sick. Many of these chemicals remain in the food that you eat. Some people believe this may cause cancer. These chemicals may also pollute water and air, and kill animals and even people by accident. Most drinks are just flavored water . Every drink coming in plastic bottles which you then throw away means a waste. Sugary drinks make you fat. In the factories, much of what you eat and drink gets messed.

What is the sentiment of the following tweet? Tweet:getting ready for my friends bonfire tonight!","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of the tweet, I will perform sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques. Here's a step-by-step breakdown: 1. Preprocess the tweet: Remove unnecessary words, symbols, or links that don't affect the sentiment. In this case, there isn't anything to remove, so the tweet remains unchanged: \\"getting ready for my friends bonfire tonight!\\" 2. Tokenize the tweet: Break the tweet into individual words. The tweet becomes: [\\"getting\\", \\"ready\\", \\"for\\", \\"my\\", \\"friends\\", \\"bonfire\\", \\"tonight\\"] 3. Determine word sentiments: Analyze each word and assign a sentiment score (positive, negative, or neutral). In general, positive words express happiness or excitement, negative words express sadness or anger, and neutral words don't convey any strong emotion. - \\"getting\\": neutral - \\"ready\\": neutral - \\"for\\": neutral - \\"my\\": neutral - \\"friends\\": positive (friends often have a positive connotation) - \\"bonfire\\": neutral (it depends on the context) - \\"tonight\\": neutral 4. Calculate overall sentiment: Now that we've assigned sentiment scores to each word, let's evaluate the overall sentiment of the tweet. - There's one positive word (\\"friends\\") and no negative words. The majority of the words are neutral. Conclusion: The sentiment of the tweet is positive.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Art review: Turner Prize, Tate Britain, London If ever you were thinking of giving the Turner Prize a miss, not rushing down to the show at Tate Britain, not tuning into the televised ceremony, then 2008 is the ideal year. It is not that the art is wilfully bad - that would at least imply energy - it is just that it is almost entirely inactive. Compared to the roaring Nineties, where everything jostled and shrieked and poked you in the eye, stirring a response one way or another, this year feels bloodless, academic and quiet. The shortlist is unusually international, not just in its choice of artists - Goshka Macuga is Polish, Runa Islam is Bangladeshi - but in the shows for which the artists were nominated. Bergen, Dijon, Oslo, Cologne (and Milton Keynes): I think we can all agree that none of us is likely to have seen more than one of these supposedly enthralling events. It is often whispered that the judges haven't either, of course, and that the show at Tate Britain may be their first real opportunity to contemplate the work of all four artists in any depth. I doubt that this is the case in 2008 - the members of the judging panel are well respected European curators and journalists, and as widely travelled as contemporary art professionals have to be in today's back-to-back biennale circuit. But something else has now become a certainty. Tate Britain can stop pretending that the public's nominations count for anything since these can hardly be the shows we proposed in our written nominations, unless we too are all European art professionals. Two other points about this year's prize: the show is being held in the museum's basement instead of the main floor, which feels apt since the prize itself is surely beginning to decline as any kind of front-page outrage. The tabloids are not likely to puff themselves up like furious bullfrogs over Islam's careful little films or the old-fashioned kitchen sink installations of Cathy Wilkes, Macuga's recherché photomontages or the passionate enthusiasm of Mark Leckey for cinema and the art of Philip Guston. The sensational years are over. But it is rumoured that there was furore among the artists themselves about who should have which rooms of the gallery and in which order of precedence. This is not surprising since a display at Tate Britain counts for a great deal if you are not yet a cherished public artist. Whatever occurred, though, the outcome was bad for the Scottish artist Cathy Wilkes whose installation looks miserably puny in a gallery the size of a tennis court. Not that it could have filled any space with conviction, vast as it is. If pressed, you might say that this rambling assemblage of dirty dishes, cookers, check-out tills and conveyer belts, old jam jars, naked shop dummies strung with horseshoes, cups, withered balloons and nurses' hats had the aesthetic of late-flowering Surrealism. But of course it hasn't really, for it is too busy hammering its point home with all the didacticism of a fifth-form project. Any item could have been removed or replaced with more of the same without any loss of effect. Look at that unwashed mug labelled Daddy, those Tommy Tippee cups, those bricks in the shape of a cross, that woman with her head in a cage - and then do the maths. One of the judges has said that Wilkes's work is about disrupting 'an idealised idea of what women might be'. Nobody could disagree. For what else could it possibly be about? This is the kind of work that really gives curators a role as major art-explainers, the kind of work that cannot speak for itself. A wall label in Goshka Macuga's room (she got the first, incidentally, which may have saved her from looking especially lifeless by comparison with what follows) informs us that her practice 'examines the conventions of archiving, exhibition making and museum display', which makes it sounds about as appealing as a dead thing under a stone. Macuga is showing scuptures of tinted glass and steel (based on designs for display stands by Lilly Reich, Mies van der Rohe's lover) that look like partitions and barriers decoupled from their usual functions. She also has a dozen photomontages which splice together images from the Tate's Paul Nash and Eileen Agar archives (the artists were lovers): photographs of her body and his art. It is possible that they are intended to be elegiac, but there is a marked absence of tone. Macuga has covered the walls in a faint shower of pencilled rain. But that is the motif to bear in mind: cold, colourless and short-lived. Leckey's work is also knee-deep in the art of the past, but he is a cheerleader by comparison. Leckey loves Guston, Baselitz, The Simpsons and Fritz the Cat. He has a film showing how the original drawings of the cat became a cartoon and another in which Jeff Koons's polished steel bunny reflects Leckey's studio in its convex surface (though somehow not his camera) that immediately brings Van Eyck's The Arnolfini Portrait to mind. Does art reflect reality or mysteriously recreate life? Images stick in Leckey's mind and he often tries to animate them himself in film and sculpture. Cinema in the Round is the title of his multi-part installation and it culminates, very fittingly, with an exuberant public lecture by Leckey in a DJ. He is in fact a professor of film studies at the Stadelschule in Frankfurt (where one of the Turner Prize judges is director) and you can bet his students adore him. No disrespect to either, but BBC4 should hire him right away. Islam's intelligent films feel, alas, almost pedantic by comparison. Rickshaw drivers perform a still life of suspended animation until a puff of wind disturbs the tableau. A well-dressed woman examines assorted items of china on plinths, slowly nudging them, little by little, until they shatter in slo-mo. But Islam does all she can to baffle the build-up of anticipation and climax, with disruptive repetitions and cuts. Her unmanned camera panning indiscriminately through the backlots of a film studio, pulling in and out of focus, swinging side to side, is an interesting idea (although of course the viewpoint never settles on anything the human eye could find interesting) - until you learn that it is spelling out the letters of the word Cinematography. I expect Islam may win, because her work is so steeped in film theory and very skilfully edited. But it made me think of better film-artists who ought to have won, such as the marvellous Tacita Dean. It is never possible to say the Turner Prize is a dead letter. Mark Wallinger won it, to the credit of all involved, last year. But until they abolish the unwritten rule that artists mustn't appear on the shortlist more than a couple of times (unlike, say, the Man Booker) then judges are going to have to keep plucking new names from ever more distant places - and genius is not so widely spread as we might hope.","completion":"The 2008 Turner Prize at Tate Britain has been criticized as inactive and lacking energy compared to the roaring art scene of the 1990s. The shortlist of artists features a diverse range of nationalities, with Goshka Macuga of Poland and Runa Islam of Bangladesh among them. Critics argue that this year's prize is unlikely to generate front-page outrage like previous years. Cathy Wilkes' installation appears cramped, and other works by Macuga and Leckey struggle to make the desired impact. While Islam's films might be the most likely to win, the overall feel of the Turner Prize in 2008 suggests that it is time for a change to revitalize the prize's relevance and excitement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects.

It is also used to describe the speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven. The hertz is equivalent to cycles per second, i.e., \\"1/second\\" or formula_1. The International Committee for Weights and Measures defined the second as \\"the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom\\" and then adds the obvious conclusion: \\"It follows that the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of the caesium 133 atom is exactly 9 192 631 770 hertz, ν(hfs Cs) = 9 192 631 770 Hz.\\" In English, \\"hertz\\" is also used as the plural form. As an SI unit, Hz can be prefixed; commonly used multiples are kHz (kilohertz, 10 Hz), MHz (megahertz, 10 Hz), GHz (gigahertz, 10 Hz) and THz (terahertz, 10 Hz). One hertz simply means \\"one cycle per second\\" (typically that which is being counted is a complete cycle); 100 Hz means \\"one hundred cycles per second\\", and so on. The unit may be applied to any periodic event—for example, a clock might be said to tick at 1 Hz, or a human heart might be said to beat at 1.2 Hz. The occurrence rate of aperiodic or stochastic events is expressed in reciprocal second or inverse second (1/s or s) in general or, in the specific case of radioactive decay, in becquerels. Whereas 1 Hz is 1 cycle per second, 1 Bq is 1 aperiodic radionuclide event per second. 1. What is a hertz? 2. What does it measure? 3. Anything else? 4. Like what? 5. How did it get its name? 6. Who is he? 7. Is it used only in English-speaking countries? 8. How do you know that? 9. What time span is used in defining the measurement? 10. How long is a second? 11. Who decided that?

Are the following two questions the same? How old is the Hindu religion? When did Hindu religion begin?","completion":"While the two questions – \\"How old is the Hindu religion?\\" and \\"When did the Hindu religion begin?\\" – may seem quite similar at first glance, they are seeking different types of information. Although both inquiries aim to understand the origins and age of Hinduism, they have distinct emphases that warrant a closer evaluation. The first question, \\"How old is the Hindu religion?\\" requests a specific duration or timeframe to accurately gauge Hinduism's age. Answering this query necessitates providing an estimated or definite number of years since the religion's inception. The Hindu religion is one of the oldest surviving religions globally, with its origins believed to date back to approximately 4,000 years ago. However, this estimation is contingent upon various factors, including archeological findings, historical texts, and evolving hypotheses. Scholars attribute Hinduism's roots to the ancient Vedic religion, which emerged between 1500 and 500 BCE in the Indian subcontinent. The period, characterized by the composition of sacred Vedic texts, saw the formation of early Hindu beliefs and practices. Consequently, it is plausible to argue that Hinduism is approximately 2,500 to 4,000 years old, although precise dating remains subject to scholarly debate. As archeological discoveries and historical research progress, these estimations may be subject to revision. Meanwhile, the second question, \\"When did Hindu religion begin?\\" necessitates identifying a specific era or period when Hinduism initially materialized. Instead of providing a numerical age, this inquiry seeks the pinpointing of a historical timeframe. As previously mentioned, Hinduism emerged between 1500 and 500 BCE, as the Vedic religion developed in the Indian subcontinent. Throughout this era, sacred scriptures – the Vedas – were composed, forming early Hinduism's belief system. Although exact dates remain uncertain, the Vedic period (1500-500 BCE) is generally referenced as the beginning of the Hindu religion. In conclusion, while both questions center around comprehending the age and origins of Hinduism, they convey distinct focuses. The first question revolves around determining the religion's age in terms of years, while the second question seeks to uncover the historical period when Hinduism commenced. Nevertheless, answering both questions requires an understanding of Hinduism's roots in the Vedic religion and the significance of the Vedic period – 1500 to 500 BCE – to the development of this ancient faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Infantry is the general branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot. As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry, infantry of the Norwegian Army. Infantry can enter and maneuver in terrain that is inaccessible to military vehicles and employ crew-served infantry weapons that provide greater and more sustained firepower. The transport and delivery techniques of modern infantrymen to engage in battle include marching, mechanised transport, aerial drop by parachute or by air assault from helicopter and amphibious landing from the sea. In English, the 16th century term infantry (ca. 1570s) describes soldiers who walk to the battlefield, and there engage, fight, and defeat the enemy in direct combat, usually to take and occupy the terrain. As describing the branch of the combat arms, the term \\"infantry\\" derives from the French infanterie, which, in turn, is derived from the Italian fanteria and ultimately from the Latin infantera; the individual-soldier term infantryman (1837) was not coined until the 19th century. Historically, before the invention and the introduction of firearms to warfare, the foot soldiers of previous eras—armed with blunt and edged weapons, and a shield—also are considered and identified as infantrymen.

Question: \\"What happened one universities were no longer the best place to get scientific information?\\" Context: \\"Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"When universities were no longer considered the best place to get scientific information, the role of scientific academies and societies significantly increased in terms of producing and disseminating new scientific knowledge.

Background: Jennifer Maria Capriati (born March 29, 1976) is an American former professional tennis player. A member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, she won three singles championships in Grand Slam tournaments, was the gold medalist at the 1992 Summer Olympics, reached the World No. 1 ranking, and is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Capriati set a number of youngest-ever records at the start of her career. She made her professional debut in 1990 at the age of 13 years 11 months, reaching the final of the hard-court tournament in Boca Raton, Florida. Context: As a result of Lindsay Davenport's withdrawal from the Australian Open due to an injury, Capriati was the top seed. She defeated the sixth-seeded Amelie Mauresmo and the fourth-seeded Kim Clijsters en route to her second consecutive final there, where she once again faced Martina Hingis. The match was played in very hot conditions, with the temperature exceeding 35 degrees Celsius. Capriati fought back from 6-4, 4-0 down and four championship points to eventually prevail 4-6, 7-6(7), 6-2. This was Capriati's third and final Grand Slam title. In the spring, Capriati reached finals in Scottsdale and Miami losing to Serena Williams on both occasions. Capriati prepared for her French Open title defense by participating in events in Charleston, Berlin, and Rome, losing in the semifinals of all three. As the top seed at the French Open, Capriati reached the semifinals--before losing to the eventual champion Serena Williams in three sets. Capriati surrendered her No. 1 ranking to Venus Williams as a result of this loss. Capriati's streak of six consecutive Grand Slam semifinals was broken at Wimbledon, where she lost to Amelie Mauresmo in three sets in the quarterfinals. She also lost to Mauresmo in the finals of the Canadian Open, and in the quarterfinals of the US Open after having served for the match. Capriati won only one match in the three European indoor events she played. She rebounded at the year-ending championships, reaching the semifinals for the first time, losing to Serena Williams. Capriati finished the year ranked third. Question: did she have any injuries during thist ime?

Here is a question about this article: In an effort to discourage Japanese militarism, Western powers including Australia, the United States, Britain, and the Dutch government in exile, which controlled the petroleum-rich Dutch East Indies, stopped selling oil, iron ore, and steel to Japan, denying it the raw materials needed to continue its activities in China and French Indochina. In Japan, the government and nationalists viewed these embargos as acts of aggression; imported oil made up about 80% of domestic consumption, without which Japan's economy, let alone its military, would grind to a halt.

U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived here on Tuesday night for meetings with fellow foreign ministers aimed at solidifying a second front, in Southeast Asia, in the campaign against global terrorism. But he has had to balance that goal with longstanding concerns about human rights abuses in the region. In meetings on Tuesday in Malaysia and Singapore before touching down in this oil-producing sultanate for two days of talks with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, Powell said he repeatedly raised the issue. \\"We still believe strongly in human rights, and that everything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights,\\" he said. But at a news conference in Singapore, Powell hinted that the Bush administration was ready to discuss resuming military cooperation with Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation and a sometimes reluctant partner in the efforts to crack down on militant Islamic groups. The United States cut virtually all military links with Indonesia in 1999 after its forces were implicated in the violence that swept East Timor after that territory voted for independence. On Thursday, Powell and representatives of the nations of the Asian group, including Indonesia, are expected to sign a declaration promising cooperation to prevent terrorism by sharing information, blocking funds, tightening borders and making it hard to use forged travel papers. \\"We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and transnational crimes, which continue to threaten world peace and stability, must be tackled by the international community,\\" the ministers said in a communique on Tuesday. Powell is among the representatives from 13 nations outside Southeast Asia, including China, Japan and Russia, that are taking part in the annual meeting of the group's regional forum. Terrorism dominates the agenda, though the possibility of a meeting here between Powell and his North Korean counterpart, Paek Nam Sun, has generated the most news. It would be the highest-level contact between the United States and North Korea since President Bush took office. Powell heads to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, late on Thursday before finishing a weeklong trip through the region in the Philippines on Saturday. He said that when he arrives in Jakarta, he will have \\"some ideas and some initiatives\\" to present to President Megawati Sukarnoputri. Indonesia is already receiving 400,000 in the current fiscal year for civilian training programs and is to receive a like amount next year; and the United States expects to provide an additional 16 million this year to train police officers in counterterrorism. At the same time, the Pentagon is reviewing how to allocate another 17 million in \\"counterterrorism fellowships,\\" some of which could go to Indonesia. But a senior State Department official also acknowledged that some in the administration and Congress are pushing for more direct military cooperation, which would require congressional approval. \\"I think they recognize the danger that we all face and I think they have been cooperating more fully with us as time goes by, and I'm quite sure that Mrs. Megawati is committed to this cause,\\" Powell said in Singapore. He met there with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who endorsed the idea of renewed military ties between the United States and Indonesia as an important step in stabilizing that country. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"A peace award\\" correctly answer the question \\"What is the US Secretary of State going to present to Indonesia's president in Jakarta?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"A peace award\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"What is the US Secretary of State going to present to Indonesia's president in Jakarta?\\".

In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term \\"vampire\\" was not popularized in the West until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by different names, such as \\"shtriga\\" in Albania, \\"vrykolakas\\" in Greece and \\"strigoi\\" in Romania.

Article: More than 40 years ago, John Williams gave away all of his belongings and went off to the mountains to live the way people lived 100 years ago. For food he traps wild animals, fishes in the rivers, and plants whatever he can. John lives in a cabin he made by hand, out of trees he chopped down with an ax. Though he has no s he knows of, he does have a deer he raised from a fawn. The deer lives in the house in the winter and goes with John when he goes into the forest for food. Nobody lives within fifty miles of his cabin in the mountains and John has not been out of the mountains during the entire forty years. One day last year I hiked in to see how John lives. It was like going back in time. There were no roads, no stores, no noise, no pollution, not even a post office. Most notable of all, there were no people and that's just the way John Williams wants to keep his part of the world--without people. But there is a paradox in his story. John is an educated man. He has books and nobody knows how he got them. Mostly he reads about his world, the forest, the animals, the plants, and the mountains. He has seen airplanes flying overhead but does not want to know about them. For him, electricity is lightning, not light bulbs, refrigerators, televisions, or washing machines.

Furthermore, their mention of frequent visits mainly for the meat and seafood sections demonstrates that they are satisfied with the offerings in those categories.

By expressing their joy in picking up \\"a few bottles of super cheap wine,\\" the reviewer shows appreciation for the competitive pricing and good deals available in this particular product category. This aspect of the review contributes further to the positive sentiment. However, the reviewer's opening statement points to the negative aspect of their experience - the high prices at Whole Foods.

Question: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis promised Thursday the Pentagon will \\"notify\\" Congress before any possible military action in Syria, where the U.S. is considering responding to a suspected chemical weapons attack. \\"There will be notification to leadership, of course, prior to the attack,\\" Mattis said in his testimony at the House Armed Services Committee. \\"We will report to Congress. We will keep open lines of communication.\\" But notably, Mattis did not indicate the Trump administration would seek congressional approval before the strike, which presumably would target the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump says the U.S. will soon launch \\"nice and new and smart\\" missiles in response to last week's suspected poison gas attack, which left scores dead in a rebel-held area. Trump blames Assad for the attack. A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution. Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world. The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq. The overwhelming majority of U.S. lawmakers have not publicly objected to the administration's legal rationale for those missions.

Meanwhile, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant and well-connected rock producer named Ronnie \\"Z-Man\\" Barzell (John LaZar), who urges the girls to give an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties. The number goes over so well that Z-Man takes the band under his wing, changing their name to The Carrie Nations, much to the chagrin of Harris. Harris is even further demeaned when Kelly gets involved with a gigolo named Lance Rocke (Michael Blodgett), who knows about her inheritance and wants her to claim as much of it as possible so that he can bleed her financially. Harris has a fling with porn star Ashley St. Ives (Edy Williams). Casey, who clearly mistrusts men, is pursued by lesbian clothes designer Roxanne (Erica Gavin). Meanwhile, Petronella has a very sweet, proper romance with law student Emerson Thorne (Harrison Page).The Carrie Nations take off as rock stars, but their personal lives begin to unravel. Porter Hall wages war on Kelly to get her to drop her claim for her share of the inheritance, and his scheme backfires; spurred on by Lance, Kelly changes her demands to half of the fortune instead of a third. When Porter realizes that Susan intends to honor her wishes, he attempts to...

Answer based on context: Trying to end a two-game losing streak, the Giants went into Lincoln Financial Field for a crucial Week 8 game with the Philadelphia Eagles, as the divisional lead was up for grabs. New York trailed greatly in the first quarter as Eagles fullback Leonard Weaver got a 41-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Donovan McNabb's 17-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brent Celek (with a blocked PAT). Philadelphia would add onto their lead in the second quarter with a 30-yard field goal from kicker David Akers. The Giants would get on the board as quarterback Eli Manning found tight end Kevin Boss on an 18-yard touchdown pass, but the Eagles continued their scoring as McNabb completed a 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson and a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jeremy Maclin. Philadelphia would begin the third quarter with an increase to their lead as Akers nailed a 35-yard field goal. New York tried to rally as kicker Lawrence Tynes booted a 35-yard field goal, followed by running back Ahmad Bradshaw. However, the Eagles would seal the win in the fourth quarter as running back LeSean McCoy got a 66-yard touchdown run. What all field goals did David Akers make?","completion":"In the context provided, David Akers, the kicker for the Philadelphia Eagles, made two field goals during the Week 8 game against the New York Giants at Lincoln Financial Field. The first field goal was scored in the second quarter, where Akers successfully kicked a 30-yard field goal. The second field goal came in the third quarter, with Akers successfully nailing a 35-yard field goal. These two field goals contributed to the overall score of the game and helped the Eagles secure their victory against the Giants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This question has options. Is the word \\"be\\" used in the same way in the following two sentences? When will the meeting be? I shall be writing to you soon. Options are: 1). different meanings 2). the same meaning","completion":"The word \\"be\\" in the two given sentences does not have the same meaning. So, the correct answer is: 1). different meanings Here's a detailed explanation: In the first sentence, \\"When will the meeting be?\\", \\"be\\" functions as a linking verb or copula. A linking verb or copula is used to link the subject (in this case, \\"the meeting\\") with a subject complement that provides additional information about the subject without expressing any action. In other words, this form of \\"be\\" connects the main subject with a state or condition. In this specific sentence, \\"be\\" is part of the future simple tense (will be) and is used to inquire about the time of the meeting. The focus here is on the existence or occurrence of the meeting. In the second sentence, \\"I shall be writing to you soon,\\" the word \\"be\\" serves as the auxiliary verb in the future continuous tense (shall be writing) construction. Auxiliary verbs are helping verbs that provide further information about the main verb, in this case, \\"writing.\\" The main verb \\"writing\\" indicates an action. In this instance, the future continuous tense is used to convey an action that will occur over a period of time in the future. The focus of this sentence is on a future progressive action (writing) that the speaker shall be performing. In conclusion, while the word \\"be\\" appears in both sentences, it carries different meanings and functions in each. In the first sentence, it serves as a linking verb denoting a state or condition, whereas, in the second sentence, it acts as an auxiliary verb illustrating a progressive action in the future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what was bernie madoff selling Suggested answer: Madoff said he began the Ponzi scheme in the early 1990s. Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","completion":"Partially correct. While it is true that Bernie Madoff operated a Ponzi scheme which he claimed had started in the early 1990s, the answer does not provide sufficient information about what he was selling. Bernie Madoff, the founder of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, was selling what appeared to be an investment opportunity with consistently high returns. He attracted investors by promising unusually stable and consistent returns, which were not affected by market fluctuations. The investment opportunity he presented was related to his market-making and proprietary trading businesses, as well as investment advisory services. In reality, Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme, one of the largest and most infamous financial frauds in history. Instead of investing clients' funds as promised, he used the money from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, creating the illusion of a successful and profitable business. This fraudulent activity went undetected for years as Madoff fabricated account statements to deceive both the investors and regulatory authorities. To better answer the question, what Bernie Madoff was selling can be described as a false investment opportunity based on the illusion of consistent high returns, fueled by a massive Ponzi scheme that lasted for decades."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War (German: Deutsch-Französischer Krieg, lit. German-French War, French: Guerre franco-allemande, lit. Franco-German War), often referred to in France as the War of 1870 (19 July 1870 – 10 May 1871), was a conflict between the Second French Empire and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification. Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck planned to provoke a French attack in order to draw the southern German states—Baden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt—into an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia, while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded.

Write a summary based on this article: Ashleigh Parker was in line to vote on Tuesday when she noticed a man in front of her wearing a T-shirt with a Confederate flag, the image of a noose, and the words “Mississippi Justice.” Rashaud’s post quickly began attracting comments and shares. He also shared the photo with a friend who posted it on Twitter , where it quickly went viral after the friend added an incorrect claim that the man in the shirt was a poll worker. (Rashaud told BuzzFeed News he initially thought the man worked at the polling station, but later said he was mistaken. Parker also confirmed the man was a voter.) “When I saw him I wanted to say something, but my mom was like, ‘Don’t say anything,’ so I took a picture and posted it on Facebook,” Rashaud told BuzzFeed News by phone. (He asked not to be identified by his full name because of safety concerns. He later deleted his Facebook post.) Parker watched the man walk over to what she said was a voting machine, and at that moment another voter who was disgusted by what they saw began taking photos. “It was racist and terrible and I hoped no one saw it. I wish I had said something but I held my tongue because I didn’t want to give him any attention,” she later wrote in a Facebook post about what she saw. Rashaud said it was shocking to see someone wearing that shirt, especially in a polling station. “It’s crazy — they try to say the rebel flag is not racist, but to have a noose on the rebel flag, it’s like, what are you trying to say?” Rashaud said. “It just shocks me that people feel it’s OK to come out in public like this. I was just kind of shook up.” As the photo spread, people began identifying the man as Clayton John Hickey, a registered nurse who works at a hospital in Memphis and lives in Olive Branch, Mississippi, where the photo was taken. Public records confirm Hickey is an RN, and that he lives in Olive Branch. BuzzFeed News spoke to three people who said they recognized Hickey in the photo. One is a former coworker, one currently works with Hickey at the same hospital, and another interacted with Hickey because he works for the fire department in Memphis. “I work for the Fire Department and I have dropped off several patients with him,” the man told BuzzFeed News in a Facebook message. (He asked to not be identified due to the fact that he could face discipline for speaking to the media without permission.) “I wasn’t at the polling place, but I know for certain that’s him,” said a former coworker, who asked not to be named due to concerns that it could affect her employment. The person who said they currently work with Hickey said he’s employed at Regional One Health. The hospital confirmed this to BuzzFeed News, and said it was aware of the photo and was investigating. A day later, it announced on Twitter that Hickey had been fired. \\"As of today, November 8, 2018, we have completed our investigation and what we learned led to the termination of the employee in question. Regional One Health holds employees to a high standard,\\" read one tweet. The hospital said it's committed to \\"fostering a safe and protected work and care environment for all. Behaviors contrary to these principles are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\\" Prior to becoming a nurse, Hickey was a Memphis police officer. He left that job after being arrested in Olive Branch in 2010 and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He was found with a 17-year-old girl and open alcohol. (It’s unclear what the outcome of the case was.) Though a few old news articles can be found about that incident, Hickey appears to have made a concerted effort in 2011 to place positive press releases, slideshows, and other references to himself on multiple websites. This is a common approach used by people to improve their online reputation. Some press release and slideshow titles include, “Clayton Hickey Is A Brave Person,” “Clayton Hickey Memphis Police – Awarded Employee Of The Month In 2000,” “Clayton Hickey Memphis Police Is A Black Belt Winner,” and “Clayton Hickey Memphis Police Loves Sports.” There’s also a Clayton Hickey Twitter account that a former coworker of his shared with BuzzFeed News, and which was used to promote links to the reputation-enhancing articles. Hickey did not respond to two emails sent to an an address found online for him, or to a phone message left at a number he previously listed in a domain name registration. (Phone numbers listed for him in public records were disconnected.) In her Facebook post, Parker said her two sons were with her at the polling station when she saw the shirt. “We talked about it on the way home, my big boys saw it and were equally offended,” she said. “Heartbreaking and not a true depiction of our community. Now there’s a picture of him going viral on twitter and of course Mississippi is taking some big hits because of it.” She added, “He doesn’t speak for me, my family or my friends. I’m disgusted.” Rashaud said seeing the shirt in a polling station helped crystalize how important it was for him and other black people to cast a ballot. “That’s the reason why we need to get out and vote. That’s my main message.” ||||| In an online post a few months later, Hickey described himself as a “generous and open-handed humanitarian who believes in helping others.” The post went on to say Hickey “is always ready to help the needy” and that “his charitable nature and loving attitude set an example for others to follow.” |||||","completion":"A registered nurse named Clayton John Hickey was fired from his job at Regional One Health after being photographed wearing a racist T-shirt at a polling station in Mississippi.
