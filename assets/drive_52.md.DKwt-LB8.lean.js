Text: While traveling through the Southern United States in around 1998, Martin McDonagh came across a couple of accusatory billboards about an unsolved crime, which he described as \`\`raging and painful and tragic (sic)''. The billboards highlighted the incompetence of police work and deeply affected McDonagh; he said that the image \`\`stayed in my mind (...) kept gnawing at me'' and presumed that they were put up by the victim's mother. This incident, combined with his desire to create strong female characters, inspired him to write the story for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. McDonagh discussed the creative process, saying that it took him about ten years to \`\`(decide) that it was a mother who had taken these things out. It all became fiction (...) based on a couple of actual billboards''. Question: three billboards outside ebbing missouri is a real story?","completion":"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not a real story, but it is inspired by a real-life incident encountered by its writer-director, Martin McDonagh, during his travels through the Southern United States around 1998. McDonagh came across billboards accusing the police of incompetence concerning an unsolved crime, which moved him deeply. These billboards, in conjunction with his ambition to create strong female characters, served as the basis for the film's narrative. Though the incident of the billboards was real, Martin McDonagh's creative process transformed and fictionalized it into the story present in the film. Over a period of approximately ten years, he adapted the concept and introduced the character of a mother putting up the billboards as a pivotal figure in the narrative. As a result, while Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri draws inspiration from actual events, it is ultimately a work of fiction crafted by McDonagh's imagination and storytelling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do you rinse a bowl of blueberries? Possible answers: *Place the bowl in the sink under the faucet, turn on the faucet until water covers the berries, swish the berries in the water with your hand, tip the bowl enough to drain the water without letting the berries fall out.. *Place the bowl in the bathtub under the faucet, turn on the faucet until water covers the berries, swish the berries in the water with your hand, tip the bowl enough to drain the water without letting the berries fall out..","completion":"Between the two options given, the better solution for rinsing a bowl of blueberries would be placing the bowl in the sink under the faucet, turning on the faucet until water covers the berries, swishing the berries in the water with your hand, and tipping the bowl enough to drain the water without letting the berries fall out. Here are the reasons why this option is considered better: 1. Accessibility: The sink is usually located in the kitchen, where the blueberries are likely to be stored and used, making it a convenient and easily accessible location for rinsing. The average consumer spends most of their food preparation time in the kitchen, making the proximity of the sink a logical choice. 2. Cleanliness: Sinks are designated primarily for cleaning dishes, utensils, and produce, so they are generally more sanitary than the bathtub. Bathtubs are used for personal hygiene and bathing, and may contain soap residue, hair, or other contaminants. Rinsing your blueberries in the bathtub could expose them to these unwanted contaminants, affecting the quality and safety of your food. 3. Efficiency: The faucet in the kitchen sink usually has a higher water pressure and flow rate compared to the bathtub faucet. This means that it is more efficient at rinsing the blueberries, as it allows for quicker filling of the bowl and better agitation of the water to dislodge dirt, debris, or pesticides. 4. Control: Kitchen sinks often have more precise control over water temperature, allowing you to rinse the blueberries with water that is not too hot or too cold. This helps prevent damage to the blueberries and ensures a more effective cleaning process. 5. Ergonomics: The height of the kitchen sink is typically more appropriate for tasks such as rinsing blueberries, as it allows for comfortable standing and less strain on the back. In contrast, using the bathtub faucet would require bending at the waist or kneeling, which can be more uncomfortable and less ergonomic for the user. 6. Drainage: Kitchen sinks usually have proper drainage systems, like a garbage disposal, to handle debris from rinsing produce. Bathtubs, on the other hand, may not have such a system, so rinsing the blueberries in the bathtub could potentially cause clogging or other drainage issues. In summary, rinsing a bowl of blueberries in the kitchen sink under the faucet is a more convenient, hygienic, efficient, controlled, ergonomic, and safe option when compared to using the bathtub for this task."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: This study examined the impact of omentin on myocardial injury in a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and explored its underlying mechanisms.', 'Obesity is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease. Omentin is a circulating adipokine that is down-regulated by obesity.', 'In patients who underwent successful reperfusion treatment after acute myocardial infarction, cardiac function and perfusion defect were assessed by using scintigraphic images. Mice were subjected to myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion.', 'This study found that high levels of plasma omentin were associated with improvement of heart damage and function after reperfusion therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Systemic administration of human omentin to mice led to a reduction in myocardial infarct size and apoptosis after I/R, which was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Akt in the ischemic heart. Fat-specific overexpression of human omentin also resulted in reduction of infarct size after I/R. Blockade of AMPK or Akt activity reversed omentin-induced inhibition of myocardial ischemic damage and apoptosis in mice. In cultured cardiomyocytes, omentin suppressed hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis, which was blocked by inactivation of AMPK or Akt. Answer: Our data indicate that omentin functions as an adipokine that ameliorates acute ischemic injury in the heart by suppressing myocyte apoptosis through both AMPK- and Akt-dependent mechanisms.

Choose from options, is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? Gas escaped the tube. Available options: [A]. unacceptable [B]. acceptable","completion":"[B]. Acceptable The sentence \\"Gas escaped the tube\\" is an acceptable formation in English grammar. Here's a more detailed look into each component of the sentence and why it is linguistically correct: 1. Subject: \\"Gas\\" - \\"Gas\\" is a general term used to refer to any substance in a state of matter where particles can freely move and fill up their container, like air or helium. Here, it's used as the subject of the sentence, meaning it's the element or person performing the action or verb. 2. Verb: \\"escaped\\" - \\"Escaped\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"escape.\\" In English, it's common to use this type of verb to express an action that occurred in the past. In the context of this sentence, \\"escaped\\" conveys that the action of the gas leaving the tube has already happened. 3. Object: \\"the tube\\" - \\"Tube\\" is a common English noun that usually refers to a long, hollow cylinder that's typically made of metal or plastic. \\"The\\" is a definite article that specifies the exact tube from which the gas escaped, implying that the tube mentioned was already known or specified in prior conversation or context. So, to put it together: the subject (Gas) performed an action in the past (escaped), and it was done to a specific object (the tube). This sentence is simple, but it completely fits the Subject-Verb-Object word order that's typical in English, along with using the right tense to show that the action was done in the past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"One never knows.\\"\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"One always knows.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"One never knows.\\", it is not accurate to conclude that the hypothesis \\"One always knows.\\" is true. Both statements, essentially, represent two opposite ends of a spectrum when it comes to human knowledge and understanding - complete uncertainty and total certainty, respectively. To analyze these assertions, we must first break them down and explore their underlying implications. The premise \\"One never knows.\\" suggests that uncertainty is a fundamental characteristic of human nature. Life is unpredictable, full of surprises, and people are continually faced with new situations, challenges, and information. Knowledge is not static, and what we know may change over time as new discoveries are made, experiences are gained, or perspectives shift. This statement acknowledges that human understanding is limited and implies that humans are incapable of omniscience - possessing complete knowledge about all subjects and matters. This uncertainty can stem from various sources, such as lack of information, individual and societal biases, cognitive limitations, or even existential and philosophical uncertainty, like the ultimate meaning of life. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"One always knows.\\" posits that human beings possess absolute certainty and that, by extension, our understanding of the world we live in is complete and unwavering. While this assertion may appear ambitious and perhaps encouraging, it fails to recognize the inherent fallibility of human nature. Mistakes, biases, contradicting beliefs, and lack of comprehensive information frequently influence our understanding and shape the way we perceive the world. Moreover, the notion of \\"always knowing\\" also encounters challenges in realms like philosophy, ethics, and morality, where many questions lack universally agreed-upon answers. Concepts such as cultural relativism and subjectivism further underscore the notion that our grasp of knowledge is continuous as our perspectives grow and evolve. In conclusion, rather than supporting one another, the premises \\"One never knows.\\" and \\"One always knows.\\" represent two competing perspectives on the nature of human knowledge and understanding. The former emphasizes the inevitability of uncertainty and incompleteness, whereas the latter suggests an unrealistic scenario of absolute certainty and omniscience. The truth lies somewhere in between these two extremes. As humans, we strive to continually learn, adapt, and grow, overcoming our limitations and encountering new information that challenges our existing beliefs. Despite our efforts and progress, we must simultaneously acknowledge and accept our inherent fallibility and the ever-changing nature of knowledge and understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri. He's a lively and clever young boy, and he finds himself in many exciting adventures . He runs away with his friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold. My favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive. Tom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story. The theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior. Why do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story.

Over the years, they have released numerous albums and earned multiple awards and accolades for their exceptional contributions to music. Their repertoire showcases a wide variety of musical styles, with the group's vocal range and tight harmonies being their signature elements. Some of their well-known hits include \\"Java Jive,\\" \\"Birdland,\\" \\"The Boy from New York City,\\" and \\"Chanson D'Amour.\\" The original lineup underwent a change in 1979 when Laurel Masse left the group due to a car accident and was subsequently replaced by Cheryl Bentyne. This revised lineup of Tim Hauser, Cheryl Bentyne, Alan Paul, and Janis Siegel continued to perform and record together for many years. Sadly, Tim Hauser passed away in 2014, but The Manhattan Transfer continues to perform and carry on their impressive legacy with Trist Curless taking Hauser's place. Throughout their illustrious career, The Manhattan Transfer has earned numerous honors and accolades. They have won 10 Grammy Awards, including the first Grammy awarded for \\"Best Jazz Fusion Vocal or Instrumental Performance\\" for their 1980 album, \\"Extensions.\\" In 1998, they became the first group ever to win Grammy Awards in both pop and jazz categories simultaneously. Additionally, they have been inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in recognition of their outstanding contributions to the vocal harmony genre. In conclusion, The Manhattan Transfer, initially made up of Tim Hauser, Laurel Masse, Alan Paul, and Janis Siegel, is a highly influential and innovative American vocal group.

I have a new situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. But I can use this background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. What is an answer for this question: Which country would have higher labor supply in response to their taxation? A:","completion":"Based on the Laffer curve and the background information provided, Germany would have a higher labor supply in response to their taxation policies. Since West Germany implemented tax rates below the critical rate, this would encourage a higher labor supply as workers and businesses are less burdened by taxation. On the other hand, France implemented tax rates above the critical rate, which could lead to a decline in labor supply due to the increased burden on businesses and workers.

Write some highlights for the following article: Private health insurance exchanges still are not able to directly enroll consumers in subsidized health plans offered through Obamacare even though the government has said problems doing so should have been cleared up weeks ago. Executives from three online health exchanges that contract with both insurance companies and government agencies to enroll consumers eligible for federal subsidies in marketplace plans say the process still isn't ready to go and that more work remains. This despite several promises from government officials that technical fixes have been made to allow for business to be conducted on those sites, which are alternatives to the troubled HealthCare.gov website and health exchanges sites run by states. The direct enrollment process designed by the Department of Health and Human Services would allow private marketplaces to direct consumers to a federal data hub to confirm their eligibility for government assistance, and then allow them to return to the third-party sites to enroll. \\"We're not going to launch anything that doesn't work, but we can't even start testing for a while yet,\\" said eHealth.com CEO Gary Lauer, weeks after the first round of fixes were announced in mid-November. \\"We're still going through all of this. The stuff we've had up to this point has been junk, and that's why I'm so concerned about this. It may not work,\\" he said. Officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency overseeing HealthCare.gov, announced in November several fixes that were supposed to allow for direct enrollment through private issuers within a matter of days. After the announcement, consumers should have been able to compare plans on a private exchange, visit HealthCare.gov to receive their subsidy eligibility, and then be directed back to the private site to complete enrollment. \\"We believe more improvements need to be made before it's stable enough and consumer-friendly enough,\\" said Michael Mahoney, senior vice president of consumer marketing at GoHealth.com, another private online health insurance exchange. Launched in 2010, GoHealth has been participating in an alternate form of direct enrollment since late November, but visitors to the site still cannot complete the entire process online as CMS officials promised. Shoppers can compare plans and get an estimate of what kind of subsidy they may qualify for through the GoHealth system, but in order to officially determine their eligibility and enroll in a plan consumers must call a GoHealth call center. \\"We're still working with CMS on a solution where you don't have to interact over the phone,\\" Mahoney said. Other private exchanges are also using their call centers as a workaround, but one official said companies are still working towards the \\"holy grail,\\" when customers can enroll online from start to finish. In November, officials at GetInsured.com told CNN they believed they were days away from launching such a process on their site. But weeks later, company spokeswoman Andrea Riggs said the direct enrollment process is still not ready for public use even though her company has been in near-daily contact with CMS. \\"We're not going to put it in front of the consumer and make noise about it until it's a great experience,\\" Riggs said. During congressional testimony on December 11, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius pointed to direct enrollment as a viable option for those who have had trouble enrolling on HealthCare.gov, which experienced enormous problems upon its October 1 launch and was only recently brought up to speed. In response to a question from Georgia Republican Rep. John Barrow about ways consumers can enroll in insurance outside of the troubled federal website, Sebelius said that private online options were available. \\"I know that the e-surance, e-health brokers have a variety of plans available,\\" Sebelius said. \\"I can't tell you how broad-based that is, but I know a number of companies, you can either sign up in person with an agent or broker or sign up online.\\" The secretary quickly clarified that in order to check whether a consumer is eligible for a premium subsidy, private issuers had to first check in with the federal data hub. But when pushed, she assured Barrow that online exchanges were participating in the process. \\"The e-health insurance folks are now engaged and involved, the brokers involved in that,\\" Sebelius said. \\"The companies are directly involved, as well as individuals navigating on their own.\\" While some individual insurance companies are currently using direct enrollment to sign up new customers on their company websites, CMS officials could not point to any private exchanges successfully using the process the way it was intended. Through private exchanges, consumers can compare plans offered by multiple providers, filter them by coverage features, and even get free advice as to what kind of coverage they may need. Insurance company sites only allow consumers to choose from plans offered by that specific company. Lauer said the government is making a mistake by not making it easier for private exchanges like his company to enroll customers, calling the redirect system designed by CMS \\"byzantine.\\" Describing himself as a supporter-turned-critic of the ACA, Lauer said at the current pace, he doesn't see how the government can reach its projection of 7 million enrollees using just HealthCare.gov and 14 state-run exchanges. \\"There's absolutely no reason why we shouldn't be connected directly to the federal data hub, we've got all kinds of security and requirements built into the regulation,\\" Lauer said, referring to the contract his company signed with CMS. \\"If they want more regulations, more requirements, bring 'em on.

Given the following context: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose publisher was Giulio ?

Question: Why did people immigrate to Portugal? Context: Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants.

Police \\"fully inspected\\" the tunnel before reopening it, Windsor authorities said. The bomb threat led to traffic backups as drivers on both sides of the border were rerouted. Employees at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel received an anonymous phone call around 12:30 p.m. from someone saying there was a bomb in the tunnel, Sgt. Matthew D'Asti with Windsor police told HLN. Authorities were working together on both sides of the border to investigate and search the tunnel for any possible device, D'Asti said. Neal Belitsky, president and CEO of Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, said the threat was called in to the Canadian side. Authorities treated the matter \\"as a nonspecific, anonymous bomb threat,\\" said D'Asti. The tunnel was evacuated. The tunnel is one of two international crossings between the cities of Windsor and Detroit. Traffic was being routed to the other, a bridge about two miles away. Approximately 27,000 to 29,000 vehicles pass daily through the tunnel, which opened in 1930. The Coast Guard said it set up a safety zone in the Detroit River in order to keep vessels away from the tunnel. CNN's Chandler Friedman, Devon Sayers and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

Hole was an American alternative rock band formed by singer and guitarist Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson in Los Angeles, California in 1989. Influenced by Los Angeles' punk rock scene, and produced by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, the band's debut album, Pretty on the Inside (1991), attracted critical interest from British and American alternative press. Their second album, Live Through This, released 1994 by DGC Records, which featured less aggressive melodies and more restrained lyrical content, was widely acclaimed and reached platinum status within a year of its release. Their third album, Celebrity Skin (1998), which garnered them four Grammy nominations, marked a notable departure from their earlier punk influences, boasting a more commercially viable, \\"mature\\" sound. In the winter of 1998-99, Hole went on tour to promote Celebrity Skin, joining Marilyn Manson, who was promoting his album, Mechanical Animals (1998) on the \\"Beautiful Monsters Tour\\". The tour turned into a publicity magnet, and Hole dropped out of the tour nine dates in, due to both the majority of the fans being Manson's, and the 50/50 financial arrangement between the groups, with Hole's production costs being disproportionately less than Manson's. Manson and Love often mocked one another onstage, and Love attacked Manson's stage antics, which included tearing up a Bible during performances: \\"You know, whenever somebody rips up the Bible in front of 40,000 people, I think it's a big deal,\\" she said during a 1999 interview. Hole officially announced that they would be dropping out of the tour after a poorly received concert at the Rose Garden Arena in Portland, Oregon, which ended with Manson fans booing the band. The band continued to book shows and headline festivals after dropping off Manson's tour, and according to Auf der Maur, it was a \\"daily event\\" for Love to invite audience members onstage to sing with her for the last song at nearly every concert performance. On June 18, 1999 during Hole's set at the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, a 19-year-old girl died after being crushed by the mosh pit behind the mixing board. Hole played its final show at Thunderbird Stadium in Vancouver on July 14, 1999. In October 1999, Auf der Maur quit Hole and went on to become a touring bassist for The Smashing Pumpkins. Samantha Maloney also quit a few months later. The band's final release was a single for the movie Any Given Sunday (1999). \\"Be a Man\\", released in March 2000, was an outtake from the Celebrity Skin sessions. Love and Erlandson officially disbanded Hole via a message posted on the band's website in 2002. After the split, the four musicians each took on projects of their own: Erlandson continued to work as a producer and session musician, eventually forming the experimental group RRIICCEE with controversial artist Vincent Gallo. Love began a solo career, releasing her debut, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. Melissa Auf der Maur also embarked on a solo career, and released her self-titled debut album in 2004, which included Erlandson performing lead guitar on the track, \\"Would If I Could.\\" Her second album, Out of Our Minds, was released in March 2010.

Goffredo and Eustazio are told by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they overcome the monsters, but as they reach the gates of the palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock in the midst of a stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight. In the palace garden Armida prepares to kill Almirena. Rinaldo draws his sword, but Armida is protected from his wrath by spirits. Suddenly Goffredo and Eustazio arrive, but as they touch the garden with their wands it disappears, leaving them all on an empty plain with the city of Jerusalem visible in the distance.

(CNN) -- Casey Anthony is responsible for the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee, a report released Thursday by Florida's Department of Children and Families concludes. A month after a jury acquitted Anthony on murder and child neglect charges, the state agency found that Anthony \\"is the caregiver responsible for the verified maltreatments of death, threatened harm and failure to protect\\" in her daughter's death. Carrie Hoeppner, a spokeswoman for the Department of Children and Families, said the report was issued this week as a \\"professional courtesy\\" after the sheriff's office and prosecutors finished their work on the case. She added that the state agency is mandated to conduct reviews when there are allegations that a child dies as a result of abuse, abandonment or neglect. The agency had no contact with the Anthonys prior to the girl's disappearance in the summer of 2008, Hoeppner added. The Orange County Sheriff's Office will not take any further action as a result of the report, Capt. Angelo Nieves said Thursday. \\"This closes out the DCF case, and it does not create additional follow-up on our part,\\" he said. The report said: \\"The Department of Children and Families concludes that the actions or the lack of actions by the alleged perpetrator ultimately resulted or contributed in the death of the child.\\" The report was signed by officials in the department Wednesday. Anthony is now free. While she was cleared on murder and aggravated child abuse charges, the 25-year-old Orlando woman was convicted on four counts related to misleading law enforcement authorities. She was sentenced to four years in jail on those convictions, but was given credit for the time she had already served between her arrest and the end of the seven-week trial and was released from jail in mid-July.

The Esquisses of 1861 are a set of highly varied miniatures, ranging from the tiny 18-bar no. 4, Les cloches (The Bells), to the strident tone clusters of no. 45, Les diablotins (The Imps), and closing with a further evocation of church bells in no. 49, Laus Deo (Praise God). They were preceded in publication by Alkan's deceptively titled Sonatine, Op. 61, in 'classical' format, but a work of \\"ruthless economy [which] although it plays for less than twenty minutes ... is in every way a major work.\\"Two of Alkan's substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 (\\"By the waters of Babylon ...\\"). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces. Alkan's publications for organ or pédalier commenced with his Benedictus, Op. 54 (1859). In the same year he published a set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes (1859, without opus number), which, in Smith's opinion, \\"seem to stand outside the barriers of time and space\\", and which he believes reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty.\\" These were followed by pieces such as the 13 Prières (Prayers), Op. 64 (1865), and the Impromptu sur le Choral de Luther \\"Un fort rempart est notre Dieu\\" , op. 69 (1866). Alkan also issued a book of 12 studies for the pedalboard alone (no opus number, 1866) and the Bombardo-carillon for pedalboard duet (four feet) of 1872.Alkan's return to the concert platform at his Petits Concerts, however, marked the end of his publications; his final work to be issued was the Toccatina, Op. 75, in 1872.","completion":"The name of the person who believes that the set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes, published in 1859, reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty\\" is Smith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to attract eastern bluebirds Choose high quality nesting boxes. Providing a secure nesting location is one of the best ways to attract bluebirds to your property. Whether you purchase or build your nesting boxes, its important to make sure that they are good quality so they will last a long time.","completion":"Additionally, it is essential to select nesting boxes that are constructed from long-lasting, weather-resistant materials, like cedar or recycled plastic composites, promoting proper ventilation and drainage. The design of the nesting box should facilitate easy access for bluebirds while deterring predators and other competitors. Installing predator guards or baffles can also help improve the safety of your nesting boxes. Furthermore, the entrance hole should be the right size (1.5 inches in diameter) to allow eastern bluebirds in but preventing larger, more aggressive birds like European Starlings and House Sparrows from taking over. It's also beneficial to have a clean-out door on the nesting box to ensure simple end-of-season cleanups and better sanitation for potential new bluebird families in the coming years. To maximize the chances of attracting bluebirds, it's crucial to find the perfect spot for your nesting boxes. Eastern Bluebirds prefer open, grassy areas with scattered trees or shrubs, where they can spot insects to feast on and escape to nearby perches if necessary. The ideal location for a nesting box is 4 to 6 feet above the ground, facing southeast (to avoid strong winds and weather exposure) and at least 100 yards away from other birdhouses since bluebirds are territorial creatures. In addition to providing a suitable nesting environment, consider complementing your efforts by offering an inviting food source like mealworms, which are a favorite of bluebirds. Setting up a mealworm feeder nearby can entice these beautiful birds to spend more time in the vicinity of the nesting boxes. Furthermore, having a clean water source, such as a birdbath or shallow pond, not only benefits bluebirds and other avian visitors but also creates an overall more attractive habitat. Lastly, be patient and persistent in your endeavours to attract eastern bluebirds. It may take time for bluebirds to find and occupy a given nesting box, but with the right combination of high-quality nesting boxes, strategic placement, supplementary food sources, and habitat improvements, you can significantly enhance your chances of welcoming these vibrant feathered friends to your property and support the conservation efforts for this once-threatened species."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association...

Dismissing Williams' appeal, judge Sir Brian Leveson said: \\"In our judgement he (Williams) cannot have any complaint with the sentence passed upon him.

Adam Davis QC argued Williams had been sentenced to \\"very many years, far in excess of what was appropriate on the facts of the case\\". \\"Is this so grave a crime that merited a sentence of 20 years for a 19 year old?\\" he said.

By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created DiscReet Records, also distributed by Warner Bros. Zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No. 10 on the Billboard pop album charts helped by the No. 86 chart hit \\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\\". Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as \\"Dinah-Moe Humm\\" and \\"Montana\\", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and One Size Fits All (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as \\"Inca Roads\\", \\"Echidna's Arf (Of You)\\" and \\"Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)\\". A live recording from 1974, You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 (1988), captures \\"the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–75 band\\". Zappa released Bongo Fury (1975), which featured a live recording at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin from a tour the same year that reunited him with Captain Beefheart for a brief period. They later became estranged for a period of years, but were in contact at the end of Zappa's life. Answer:","completion":"DiscReet Records"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is?","completion":"The answer to the trivia question is \\"Julius Caesar.\\" The 1953 film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play, \\"Julius Caesar,\\" starred renowned actors such as Marlon Brando, James Mason, Louis Calhern, John Gielgud, Deborah Kerr, and Greer Garson. This critically acclaimed film was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who also served as a producer and screenplay writer for the movie. In this adaptation, Marlon Brando took on the role of Mark Antony, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. James Mason portrayed the character of Brutus, while Louis Calhern played Julius Caesar. John Gielgud, a renowned Shakespearean actor, portrayed Cassius, and Greer Garson appeared as Calpurnia, Caesar's wife. Deborah Kerr, though not in the original stage production, played Portia, the wife of Brutus. The movie stays quite true to the original play, telling the story of Julius Caesar's rise and eventual assassination at the hands of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius. The film's screenplay, adapted directly from Shakespeare's text, retains much of the rich language and famous lines, such as \\"Beware the Ides of March\\" and \\"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.\\" The 1953 film version of \\"Julius Caesar\\" was well-received by both audiences and critics, garnering five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor (for Marlon Brando). The film ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White.

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. and the situation: John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L.

Bernard Lewis, FBA (born 31 May 1916) is a British American historian specializing in oriental studies. He is also known as a public intellectual and political commentator. Lewis is the Cleveland E. Dodge Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University. Lewis' expertise is in the history of Islam and the interaction between Islam and the West. In 1936, Lewis graduated from the School of Oriental Studies (now School of Oriental and African Studies, SOAS) at the University of London with a BA in history with special reference to the Near and Middle East. He earned his PhD three years later, also from SOAS, specializing in the history of Islam. Lewis also studied law, going part of the way toward becoming a solicitor, but returned to study Middle Eastern history. He undertook post-graduate studies at the University of Paris, where he studied with the orientalist Louis Massignon and earned the \\"Diplome des Etudes Semitiques\\" in 1937. He returned to SOAS in 1938 as an assistant lecturer in Islamic History. During the Second World War, Lewis served in the British Army in the Royal Armoured Corps and as a Corporal in the Intelligence Corps in 1940-41 before being seconded to the Foreign Office. After the war, he returned to SOAS. In 1949, at the age of 33, he was appointed to the new chair in Near and Middle Eastern History. In 1974, aged 57, Lewis accepted a joint position at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study, also located in Princeton, New Jersey. The terms of his appointment were such that Lewis taught only one semester per year, and being free from administrative responsibilities, he could devote more time to research than previously. Consequently, Lewis's arrival at Princeton marked the beginning of the most prolific period in his research career during which he published numerous books and articles based on previously accumulated materials. After retiring from Princeton in 1986, Lewis served at Cornell University until 1990. In 1966, Lewis was a founding member of the learned society, Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA), but in 2007 he broke away and founded Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa (ASMEA) to challenge MESA, which the New York Sun noted as \\"dominated by academics who have been critical of Israel and of America's role in the Middle East.\\" The organization was formed as an academic society dedicated to promoting high standards of research and teaching in Middle Eastern and African studies and other related fields, with Lewis as Chairman of its academic council. In 1990, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Lewis for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. His lecture, entitled \\"Western Civilization: A View from the East\\", was revised and reprinted in The Atlantic Monthly under the title \\"The Roots of Muslim Rage.\\" His 2007 Irving Kristol Lecture, given to the American Enterprise Institute, was published as Europe and Islam.

Here are possible answers to this question: - falling down - tripping - death - lower standards - slurred speech I believe the correct choice is \\"falling down\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"\\"Falling down\\". When someone is intoxicated, they experience a loss of coordination, poor balance, and slower reaction times due to the effects of alcohol on the central nervous system. This makes it more difficult for them to navigate stairs safely, increasing the risk of falling down.

While the other options provided may also be outcomes of getting drunk, they don't directly relate to the danger associated with using stairs. Tripping could be a cause of falling down, but falling down better encapsulates the scenario described. Death, although possible as a result of falling down, is a more extreme consequence and not the most fitting answer.

Ants are one of the most interesting creatures on earth. David wants to study ants for his biology project. He is specifically interested in ant species Acromyrmex heyeri. This semester he studied this ant in Americas. First day when he studied the ants the temperature was 10 degree Centigrade. In the second day of his study the temperature rose to 25 degree Centigrade. In the third day of his study the air humidity was high. But in the fourth day of his study air humidity dropped. David wants to continue his study of this same ant species in Asia next semester. Hint: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.

Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed.

United boss Louis van Gaal wants to sign Vermaelen in a £12million deal. Vermaelen has grown frustrated at a lack of opportunities at Arsenal. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is ready to offer Vermaelen a new deal.","completion":"Title: Arsenal Captain Thomas Vermaelen Eyeing Manchester United Move Post-World Cup Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen has reportedly confided in close friends that he is strongly considering a move to Manchester United after the World Cup. With United's new boss Louis van Gaal showing interest in signing the Belgian defender in a £12 million deal, Vermaelen may just be on the brink of switching sides. The recent developments have come to light as the player grows increasingly frustrated due to limited opportunities at Arsenal. Thomas Vermaelen has been a part of Arsenal since 2009 when he signed with the club after leaving Ajax. Initially, the defender made a strong impact within the squad and was subsequently named captain in 2012 – a testament to his importance at the club. However, over time, Vermaelen has faced stiff competition for a starting spot in the team, thereby putting his position and long-term future plans in jeopardy. United boss Louis van Gaal has expressed his desire to bolster the team's defense ahead of the new season - an essential decision following the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic from the club. Vermaelen, having demonstrated his ability both as a center-back and left-back, could be the answer Van Gaal is looking for to offer a stable and experienced presence at the heart of the defense. Moreover, in the light of Vermaelen’s team-leading skills, there is significant potential for a smooth transition in acclimating to the demands of his potential new club. While the prospect of moving to Manchester United appears to be enticing for Vermaelen, any final decision is bound to demand careful consideration. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has shown his intent to keep the Belgian in his squad by offering him a new deal. Wenger's potential offer may throw a spanner in the works, as Vermaelen, who still holds the captaincy at Arsenal, must weigh the opportunities and possibilities both clubs present. Overall, a potential move to Manchester United by Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen seems to be gaining momentum as the 2014 FIFA World Cup comes to an end. With a £12 million deal on the table and the allure of more playing time, it is up to the defender to decide his future. Arsene Wenger's willingness to put forward a new deal reflects the player's value to the Arsenal squad, but Vermaelen's grievances regarding his lack of opportunities could be the deciding factor in this transfer saga. The final decision lies in Vermaelen's hands, but one thing is for certain - the conclusion of the World Cup will mark the beginning of an intense battle for his signature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Will Stewart and Leon Watson. PUBLISHED:. 07:07 EST, 26 March 2012. |. UPDATED:. 17:57 EST, 28 March 2012. A Moscow oligarch whose attempted killers were allegedly fingered by the banker shot in London has claimed Russian 'terrorism' has arrived on Britain's streets. Alexander Antonov spoke out in support of German Gorbuntsov, 45, now in a coma after being gunned down in a suspected contract killing attempt last Tuesday. Shortly before the attack the wounded banker had given evidence implicating his own associates in an earlier mafia-style assassination bid against Mr Antonov, a key figure in the Converse Bank empire. Coma: German Gorbuntsov (left) was repeatedly shot outside a block of flats near Canary Wharf in an attempted assassination. There are now also fears for the safety of Larisa Gorbuntsov (right) who flew to her husband's bedside in London. At one point, the Russian authorities. regarded Mr Gorbuntsov as a possible suspect because of an alleged. 106million debt owed by Mr Antonov to Gorbuntsov. Yesterday, 61-year-old Mr Antonov claimed that he and Mr Gorbuntsov had 'normal' and even 'friendly' relations. 'He was not a part of the. assassination attempt. He had some information about how it was. prepared, and wanted to pass it on, that's it,' he said. Asked why Mr Gorbuntsov had been. targeted, he said: 'Perhaps because the people who did it were very. scared of this information getting publicly known, specially given that,. as I understood, German was adamant in his decision to make it public. 'So they went as far in the centre of. the legal world - I consider London to be the capital of the legal world. - in prime time, to carry out this slaughter.' He stressed: 'My personal attitude to. it is that it simply beggars belief, it beggars belief. How can you sort. business issues by such methods? It is terrorism. It is simply. terrorism. Shooting: German Gorbuntsov, 45, was attacked on the Isle of Dogs close to Canary Wharf. 'But I think the fact that it happened. in London does give hope to believe that Russian and British law. enforcement systems would together discover who did it, and get the. b******s.' Asked if he agreed that the two men. named by Mr Gorbuntsov to Russian prosecutors - Pyotr Chuvilin and Sergei. Mendeleyev - as being behind the Mr Antonov assassination attempt, were. indeed involved. 'I'm scared to give the positive. answer to that, is it up to the investigation and the court to establish. it. But they can be somewhere there. Nearby. ' Asked if Russians were behind the crime, he said: 'I agree.' Asked whether he would now feel safe coming to London, he said: 'Well, what do you do? You've got to keep living. ' Gun blast: German Gorbuntsov is pictured here being carried into ambulance after being shot in Canary Wharf. Gorbuntsov's testimony appeared to give the missing link in establishing who ordered the attack against Antonov. Gorbuntsov's lawyer Vadim Vedenin has. admitted in the Mr Antonov case that his client was initially 'suspected in. organising this attempt on his life', because he was present at the. meeting where property claims to the Antonov family were talked about. and where the Antonovs were threatened. 'This is true, he was present there,. we do not deny it. But still he is not in anyway related to the attempt. on his life itself.' Alexander Antonov, father of former Portsmouth FC owner Vladimir Antonov, lost the use of an arm after a 2009 assassination bid in Moscow. Three Chechen men were convicted of attempted murder and sent to prison on long sentences a year later, but police never identified the mastermind. The same gang was convicted of killing Ruslan Yamadayev, rivals to hardman Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's Kremlin-backed president. Ex-Russian MP Yamadayev was gunned down in his car close to the British Embassy in Moscow in September 2008. His brother Sulim, a Kadyrov enemy, was shot dead in Dubai in March 2009 by men using a gold-plated pistol. In November 2006 Russian dissident Alexander. Litvinenko (pictured above) was murdered in London. British. prosecutors have named his fellow ex-KGB agent Andrei Lugovoy as the. main suspect in his poisoning with radioactive polonium-210. However, the Russian authorities have repeatedly refused to send him to face trial in the UK.' The lawyer stressed: 'He clearly said he had nothing to do with the attempt on Antonov's life.' It has also emerged Mr Gorbuntsov was preparing to claim political asylum in Britain for himself and his family. The financier's business visa, which had allowed him to live here legally since 2008, expires next year. It is thought the 45-year-old feared he would be forced to return to Russia and into the clutches of his many enemies. He said recently: ‘If I go back to. Russia, they will kill me.’ Last night Mr Gorbuntsov was under armed. guard in hospital after being hit up to six times. With. the would-be assassin still on the loose there were fears for the. safety of Mr Gorbuntsov’s wife Larisa, 46, and son. Mrs Gorbuntsov flew. to London to be at her husband’s bedside while their 25-year-old son. Vladislav is seeking a visa to come to Britain. Scotland. Yard yesterday appealed for a taxi driver who may have witnessed the. shooting to come forward. Mr Gorbuntsov was shot after being dropped off. by taxi at his apartment block next to Canary Wharf on Tuesday evening. The. banker, who had been at a business meeting in Bishopsgate in the City. earlier that evening, hailed the hackney carriage at 7pm. He had just. stepped out of the car at 7.30pm when he fell in a hail of bullets. The. hooded gunman, described as white, 6ft tall and slim, fled on foot. A. young blonde woman, reported to be Mr Gorbuntsov’s mistress and the. mother of his second child, was at his side as emergency services. arrived. Mr Gorbuntsov's lawyer also said the banker had been planning to submit a. political asylum request to stay within days. A successful asylum claim. would have helped him fight off attempts by Moldova to extradite him on. allegations of embezzlement. There. was also an apparent financial wrangle with state-controlled Russian Railways,. whose president is an ally of Vladimir Putin. An estimated £415million. was allegedly not repaid after being deposited by the business into a Moscow bank. whose ownership later passed to Mr Gorbuntsov and his associates.

Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation. Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST : My girlfriend left my place moments ago to get space. I think she left feeling hurt that I ruined what she wanted to do and me feeling that she ruined what we had planned with a surprise which could have been pleasant if it had been done differently. Am I the asshole here? **Backstory:** I'm 26 and she is 36. We've been dating for a few months now. There have been a few times where I felt she was unreliable with plans already made or things she said and didn't follow through with. There have been a few occasions where she wasn't ready at the time we had planned on. There have been a few occasions where she said she would call/message in a while and didn't. Or she would stop over when something was done and didn't. Or changed her mind altogether. My previous relationship ended with me breaking up with my ex because she continuously blew me off last minute for other things. One time we were planning to see a movie and she said she would rather hang out with some friends. I wasn't invited and later came to find out they had gone to the movies. This hurt me deeply and to lookout for myself I called it quits with that relationship. It had become a pattern. I shared this with my current girlfriend and on the occasions I mentioned above rather than bottle things up I let her know that it bothered me so she wasn't new to how much being reliable meant to me. I said it along the lines of I don't think there are a lot of things which bother me much but this is a sore spot and something that ended my previous relationship and with it bothering me could she please be considerate of that. **Which leads us to tonight:** I had spent the night at her place and before leaving to do some stuff I put out there that maybe we could do something later. She knows I've been wanting to go see a movie together for a while. As I was finishing up at the gym at about 9pm I asked if she would like to see a movie. The conversation went like this: Me: I could go for some chicken tenders and an ice cream cookies sandwich. What about you? (the theater has food) Her: What time Me: Would you like to pick? I know I'd like the tenders ice cream and you. Not too worried about which movie or time. Her: Sure let me look :) Her: Okay I picked that happy death day 2 at 10:30pm is that okay Me: Yes, done. Me: I'm home now going to have a protein shake. I'll be back over in time for the movie. Her: Is there anything you want me to bring Me: Not that I can think of. When I was leaving the house I told her I was on my way and she said no don't go she is on her way. At that point I was in the car just down the street but no big deal I went back home. She gets over and comes in, sits down for a few minutes and I play some music. We were timing the movie to get there missing most of the previews. I was very much looking forward to and planning on being warm with a blanket at the theater and getting food there because I was hungry. As I was putting my coat on for us to go out the door she tells me wait. That I have encouraged her to speak her mind and go with what she is feeling. I asked what's up. She said she doesn't really want to go to the movie now and would rather do something else. She isn't sure what but will I come along for a surprise night. She mentioned going to a graveyard or some railroad tracks or out to a bar to get a drink and shoot pool. I told her that yes she is most certainly free to speak her mind but those things didn't interest me at the moment, my heart was set on getting food and being cuddled up watching a movie. I said I didn't want to be outside in the cold (New York) and we had gone out to a bar on Friday already. She asked why I couldn't be more open minded to surprises. I responded that I'm okay with surprises but I didn't like how last minute this was after we already had plans and were almost out the door. I told her I believe that had she instead suggested a surprise night earlier such as at 9pm when I first asked about seeing a movie, I would have been receptive to it. I followed up with, can we still go see the movie tonight and do a surprise something another time? She said no, she isn't going to see the movie now but I am welcome to still go myself. I said okay you can go do what you want and I'll go see the movie and I don't like that we ended up in this situation. There was some more back and forth at which point I likely would have missed the beginning of the movie so I changed to I would stay home and find something to eat. **Change of plans:** Let me admit I was upset now and took a snarky tone. She wanted me to go along with her for the ride and see what happened. I asked if we could still take care of me getting something to eat and not be in the cold. So there I am and we're in the car. She stops for gas and we're talking. I brought up again that reliability is very important to me and that I felt this was her being unreliable and reminded her that it had ended a relationship before. I'm not sure how rough it came across to her. I didn't mean it as a threat, rather I was distressed and urgently trying to convey how important this was to me so that it would be taken seriously. She said she would just take me home. I said here I am already with you, I can stay quiet if you like, let's just do what you want to do and make the best of things. She took us to Walmart where she proceeded to wander around and get nothing. As we talked while walking around she divulged that she had wanted to go to her father's grave but I had ruined that for her and she was no longer in the mood for it. I said I wish she had said so sooner, that I thought that would be a sweet thing to do and that I was up for doing that. She lost her father about a year ago which I am sympathetic to. I went on to say I would be honored to go with her and that I recognize the significance of her inviting me there. She reiterated that it was already ruined for her at the moment. I asked how long she had known this was what she wanted to do. She said it hadn't occurred to her that it was what she wanted to do until when we were leaving the gas station. At that point I wasn't happy but was talking about salvaging the night doing something and said of all things I didn't want to just walk around Walmart. So we left and she said she would drop me off at home. I said we could watch a movie at my place, still go to the graveyard, go out for a drink, do something to end the night on a better note. She could come in or we could go to her place. Reluctantly she came in but just started cleaning stuff. We weren't doing anything together. She said I could start doing what I wanted and I said what I wanted was to do something together. She said I told you in the car I didn't want to do anything together right now and want space. She got her coat and left. So from planning to see a movie and have food to being here writing this.

Augusta Jane Evans, or Augusta Evans Wilson (May 8, 1835 - May 9, 1909), was an American author of Southern literature. She was the first woman to earn US100,000 through her writing. Wilson was a native of Columbus, Georgia, and her first book, Inez, a Tale of the Alamo, was written when she was still young. Augusta Evans Wilson was not a professional writer and her style was severely criticized as \\"pedantic.\\" She wrote in the domestic, sentimental style of the Victorian Age. Critics have praised the intellectual competence of her female characters, but as her heroes eventually succumb to traditional values, Wilson has been described as an antifeminist. Of St. Elmo one critic maintained, \\"the trouble with the heroine of St. Elmo was that she swallowed an unabridged dictionary.\\" Wilson was the first American woman author to earn over 100,000. This would be a record unsurpassed until Edith Wharton. Macaria, or Altars of Sacrifice, published in 1864, was popular with Southerners and Northerners alike. Melissa Homestead writes that the transportation of the novel to New York was deliberate, done in installments and nearly simultaneous with the novel's preparation for publication in the South. Thus, while previous critics, scholars and biographers have all treated Macaria's appearance in the North as unauthorized, the truth is much more meaningful. Some scholars say that by dispensing with the romantic notion that the novel appeared in a \\"bootleg\\" edition, Homestead debunks the hard and fast distinction between Northern and Southern readerships as an invention of historians and critics rather than an accurate reflection of reading practices of the period. However, a great number of discrepancies exist between the version published in the North and the version published in the South, which remove huge portions of the text which romanticize the Southern heroes that are portrayed. Her novel St. Elmo was her most famous and it was frequently adapted for both the stage and screen. It inspired the naming of towns, hotels, steamboats, and a cigar brand. The book's heroine, Edna Earl, became the namesake of Eudora Welty's heroine (Edna Earle Ponder) in The Ponder Heart published in 1954. The novel also inspired a parody of itself called St. Twel'mo, or the Cuneiform Cyclopedist of Chattanooga (1867) by Charles Henry Webb.

In this equation, both terms on the left side of the equation, -9v and -16v, are like terms since both have the same variable, v. -9v - 16v = (-9 - 16)v When you add -9 and -16, you get: -25v So the equation becomes: -25v = -100 Step 2: Isolate the variable (v). To do this, you need to divide both sides of the equation by -25. (-25v) / (-25) = (-100) / (-25) v = 4 Step 3: Check your answer. Substitute the value of v back into the original equation to see if it is correct: -9*v - 16*v = -100 -9*(4) - 16*(4) -36 - 64 = -100 Both sides of the equation are equal, so the solution is correct.

A pay order is like a special note that promises to pay a specific amount of money to the person whose name is on it. It's issued by a bank and is very safe, because only the named person can get the money. A cheque is like a written instruction that tells your bank to pay a certain amount of money to someone else's bank account. You write the amount, the name of the person, and sign it.

Natural places include a variety of geographical, geological, and ecological features such as rivers, lakes, forests, mountains, and deserts. These locations provide habitats for plants, animals, and other organisms, and often play crucial roles in natural processes like the water cycle, erosion, and nutrient cycling. The study of these natural places is an integral part of disciplines like geography, geology, and environmental science. Furthermore, natural places like rivers continue to be essential for human societies, providing vital resources like water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use. They can also offer recreational opportunities for activities like fishing, boating, and swimming, as well as promoting tourism and local economies. Due to their significance to both ecological systems and human life, the conservation and management of such natural places are of utmost importance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Do the above sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"No, the above sentences do not mean the same thing. They are related but convey different aspects of Kathy Nicolo's character and situation. The first sentence highlights the significance of the house in Kathy Nicolo's (Jennifer Connelly) life. For her, the house represents stability and family, which are essential components of her emotional, personal, and psychological well-being. This sentence underscores the importance of the connection between the physical space of the house and Kathy's emotional connection to it. It shows that owning and maintaining the house is crucial for her sense of belonging and security within her family and her life in general. The second sentence, on the other hand, delves more into Kathy's personal situation and her internal struggle. It suggests that Kathy is going through tough times, and her life has spiraled out of control. However, she is reluctant to let her family know about her situation, and desperately tries to prevent them from finding out. This sentence highlights her desire to maintain an appearance of normalcy and stability for her family. It also sheds light on the emotional burden she carries, as she grapples with the fear of being exposed and the need to safeguard her family's image within the community and her own self-esteem. In summary, the first sentence emphasizes the importance of the house as a symbol of stability and family for Kathy Nicolo, whereas the second sentence deals with the emotional complexity of her life as she hides the truth about her messy situation from her family. While both sentences revolve around the theme of family and stability, they provide different perspectives on Kathy's experience, making them distinct, yet related, concepts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - Clinton \\"Clint\\" Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, filmmaker, musician, and political figure. After earning success in the Western TV series \\"Rawhide\\", he rose to international fame with his role as the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's \\"Dollars\\" trilogy of spaghetti Westerns during the 1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five \\"Dirty Harry\\" films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity. - Rhodesia, commonly known from 1970 onwards as the Republic of Rhodesia, was an unrecognised state in southern Africa from 1965 to 1979, equivalent in territorial terms to modern Zimbabwe. With its capital in Salisbury (now Harare), Rhodesia was considered a \\"de facto\\" successor state to the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia (which had achieved responsible government in 1923). - Spaghetti Western, also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western (primarily in Japan), is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's film-making style and international box-office success.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth. and the situation: Robert, a baker, has just baked a large batch of cupcakes for his store. He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer. Answer the following question: Which temperature will result in faster decay of the cupcakes? Answer:","completion":"Given the background information on freezing as a method of food preservation and the situation presented about Robert and his cupcakes, we can analyze the impact of the two temperature options (0° F and 10° F) on the rate of decay of the cupcakes. Freezing is effective in preserving food because both the reduction in temperature and the decreased availability of water for bacterial growth slow down the process of food decay. Lower temperatures cause a reduction in the reaction rates of chemical and enzymatic processes in food, which in turn slows down deterioration and the growth of micro-organisms. Additionally, when water freezes, it becomes less available for bacterial growth, further enhancing preservation. In Robert's situation, he wants to preserve a portion of the cupcakes for later by storing them in the freezer. When comparing the two temperature options, 0° F would be the better choice for the following reasons: 1. Lower temperatures slow down reaction rates: At 0° F, reactions, both chemical and enzymatic, will occur at a slower pace compared to those at 10° F. This is because lower temperatures decrease the kinetic energy and molecular movement, resulting in fewer effective collisions between reacting molecules. Therefore, a temperature of 0° F would slow down decomposition more effectively than 10° F. 2. Reduced bacterial growth: Bacteria and other micro-organisms are the main agents of food spoilage. The lower the temperature, the slower their growth. At 0° F, the metabolic activities of bacteria would be even more suppressed than at 10° F, which means that bacterial growth and reproduction would be slower at the lower temperature. Consequently, preserving the cupcakes at 0° F would result in a longer shelf life. 3. Less water available for bacterial growth: One of the key aspects of the freezing process is making water less available for bacterial growth. At 0° F, more water content in the cupcakes will be frozen, binding the liquid and minimizing its availability for bacterial activity. Conversely, at 10° F, slightly more water may be available for these organisms, increasing the potential for spoilage. In conclusion, if Robert stores his cupcakes at 0° F, the rate of decay will be slower than at 10° F due to the more pronounced reduction in molecular motion and reaction rates, further inhibition of bacterial growth, and decreased water availability for micro-organisms. Thus, 0° F is the better choice for preserving the cupcakes and maintaining their quality for later consumption."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Part #2: Identify the given statement Usage: The statement is \\"Tvrtka je željela ocijeniti zadovoljstvo kupaca.\\" (The company wanted to evaluate customer satisfaction). This statement provides context for the following choices, and the task is to determine which choice represents the cause or effect of this statement. Part #3: Analyzing the choices Usage: Choice 1: \\"Ponudila je popust novim kupcima.\\" (Offered a discount to new customers). This choice is an action taken by the company, but it does not seem to be directly related to evaluating customer satisfaction. Choice 2: \\"Poslala je anketu kupcima.\\" (Sent a survey to customers). This choice is an action that could be a consequence of the company's desire to evaluate customer satisfaction, as a survey is a common method to gather feedback. Part #4: Matching the choice with the label Usage: Since the label is 'effect', the choice that reflects the consequences of the statement is the answer. Choice 2, \\"Poslala je anketu kupcima\\" (Sent a survey to customers) is an example of the consequence of the company's desire to evaluate customer satisfaction.

Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company.

Kredi 20 yıl vade ve 5 yıllık ödemesiz süreye sahip bulunuyor. Translate to English","completion":"The loan has a 20-year term and a 5-year grace period without payments. In this statement, the loan terms are being described. It is explained that the loan has a repayment period of 20 years in total, meaning the borrower has this amount of time to repay the loan fully. Additionally, there is a 5-year grace period, which signifies that during the initial five years of the loan term, the borrower does not have to make any payments towards the loan principal or interest. This type of loan is often sought by borrowers who have an expectation of increased income or financial stability in the future or for those looking for flexibility in the early stages of the loan repayment process. This grace period allows them to focus their resources on other financial commitments. However, it is crucial for borrowers to understand that during the grace period, typically only interest keeps accruing on the loan and is capitalized into the outstanding loan amount. Consequently, when the grace period ends, they may find themselves faced with a higher loan balance and increased monthly payments. Banks and financial institutions offering such loans usually evaluate the applicant's financial situation, income, and their ability to repay the loan once the grace period ends. Ensuring responsible lending practices and preventing a financial burden on the borrowers are important aspects that lenders must consider while approving these types of loans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, Jenny had already checked that and confirmed that they were halfway full. The next thing Tom inquired was if Jenny had properly checked the paper in the printer. It was a joke, as it's among the basic things that almost anyone would first check, hence his playful tone. However, Jenny confirmed she too had checked this.

What is the title of this article: Islamic political philosophy, was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of Islam—i.e., the Qur'an and the Sunnah, the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: al-Kindi (Alkindus), al-Farabi (Abunaser), İbn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), and Ibn Khaldun. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), sultan, ummah, cemaa (obligation)-and even the \\"core\\" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., ibadah (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and ilah (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah, or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought.

At the moment, he is trying to bring down his former partner Gabriel Callahan, who has become a drug kingpin. Callahan is trying to, and slowly succeeding at, taking over the New Orleans underworld. Stowe botches a sting operation against Callahan, resulting in the death of fellow cop Maria Ronson, whose fiancée, fellow cop Van Huffel, nearly comes to blows with him over it. Chief Mac Baylor has a very blunt chat with Stowe, who is dismissive. Stowe is approached by fellow cop Walter Curry to help his nephew beat a drug-dealing charge; he instead turns Curry over to Baylor, who fires him. After barricading himself in the station bathroom, Walter confronts an unrepentant Stowe and condemns him for betraying his fellow officers. That night Stowe meets with his estranged wife, Valerie, who tells him that she's pregnant, but that he's not the father. Valerie, whose marriage with Stowe is close to collapse, has been seeing a man named Mark Rossini, the gym teacher at the school she is principal of. But he may not be the father either. Stowe brashly accuses Valerie of being impregnated by Callahan, and she tells him she never wants to see him again. The only thing keeping Stowe from total collapse is his dogged pursuit of Callahan. But he drunkenly stumbles into an ambush masterminded by Callahan, and is shot in the head by Callahan's right-hand man Jimmy. Stowe undergoes emergency surgery, and ends up in a coma. Months later, he recovers to the point that he opens his eyes, and is transported to his and Valerie's house to recover properly. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the man that shot Anthony Stowe?, what is it ?

Information: - The Low Countries is a coastal region in western Europe, consisting especially of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the low-lying delta of the Rhine, Meuse, Scheldt, and Ems rivers where much of the land is at or below sea level. This wide area of Western Europe roughly stretches from French Gravelines and Dunkirk at its southwestern point, to the area of Dutch Delfzijl and German Eastern Frisia at its northeastern point, and to Luxembourg and French Thionville in the southeast. - Fijnaart en Heijningen is a former municipality in the Dutch province of North Brabant . It covered the villages of Fijnaart and Heijningen . Fijnaart en Heijningen was a separate municipality until 1997 , when it was merged with Zevenbergen . - Zevenbergen is a Dutch city which is a part of the municipality of Moerdijk. Zevenbergen is located in the northwest of the province of Noord-Brabant near Breda. - A strait is a naturally formed, narrow, typically navigable waterway that connects two larger bodies of water. Most commonly it is a channel of water that lies between two land masses. Some straits are not navigable, for example because they are too shallow, or because of an unnavigable reef or archipelago. - A province is almost always an administrative division, within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman \\"provincia\\", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \\"outside the capital city\\". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy. - Zeeland (Zeelandic: \\"Zeêland\\" ) is the westernmost province of the Netherlands. The province, located in the south-west of the country, consists of a number of islands and peninsulas (hence its name, meaning \\"sea-land\\") and a strip bordering Belgium. Its capital is Middelburg. Its area is about , of which almost is water, and it has a population of about 380,000. - Noord Brabant, also unofficially called Brabant, is a province in the south of the Netherlands.

The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands. Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794. - Fijnaart is a town in the Dutch province of North Brabant. It is located in the municipality of Moerdijk, about 8 km west of the town of Zevenbergen. - The Meuse (Walloon: \\"Mouze\\" ) or Maas is a major European river, rising in France and flowing through Belgium and the Netherlands before draining into the North Sea. It has a total length of . - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - The Dutch Republic, also known as the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands ('), Republic of the United Netherlands or Republic of the Seven United Provinces ('), was a republic in Europe existing from 1581, when part of the Netherlands separated from Spanish rule, until 1795. It preceded the Batavian Republic, the Kingdom of Holland, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and ultimately the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands. Alternative names include the United Provinces ('), Seven Provinces ('), Federated Dutch Provinces ('), and Dutch Federation ('). - The Generality Lands, Lands of the Generality or Common Lands were about one fifth of the territories of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, that were directly governed by the States-General. Unlike the seven provinces Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, Overijssel, Friesland and Groningen, these territories had no States-Provincial and were not represented in the central government. - Moerdijk is a municipality and a town in the South of the Netherlands, in the province of North Brabant. - South Holland is a province in the midwestern Netherlands. It has a population of just over 3.6 million (as of 2015) and a population density of about , making it the country's most populous province and one of the world's most densely populated areas. Situated on the North Sea in the west of the Netherlands, South Holland covers an area of , of which is water. It borders North Holland to the north, Utrecht and Gelderland to the east, and North Brabant and Zeeland to the south. The provincial capital is The Hague, while its largest city is Rotterdam. - Hollands Diep (pre-1947 spelling: Hollandsch Diep) is a wide river in the Netherlands and an estuary of the Rhine and Meuse river.

With a land area of nearly 5,000 km, it is the largest province of the Netherlands and shares borders with six other provinces and Germany. - The Duchy of Brabant was a State of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was partitioned after the Dutch revolt. - The Peace of Westphalia was a series of peace treaties signed between May and October 1648 in the Westphalian cities of Osnabrück and Münster, effectively ending the European wars of religion. These treaties ended the Thirty Years' War (16181648) in the Holy Roman Empire, and the Eighty Years' War (15681648) between Spain and the Dutch Republic, with Spain formally recognizing the independence of the Dutch Republic. - The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories. - Holland is a region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. The name \\"Holland\\" is also frequently used to informally refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. This usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and not entirely uncommon among the Dutch themselves, though some in the Netherlands and particularly in other regions of the country may find it undesirable, misleading or insulting. - The RhineMeuseScheldt delta or Helinium is a river delta in the Netherlands formed by the confluence of the Rhine, the Meuse and the Scheldt rivers. The result is a multitude of islands, branches and branch names that may at first sight look bewildering, especially as a waterway that appears to be one continuous stream may change names as many as seven times, e.g. Rhine Bijlands Kanaal Pannerdens Kanaal Nederrijn Lek Nieuwe Maas Het Scheur Nieuwe Waterweg ( North Sea). Since the Rhine contributes most of the water, the shorter term \\"Rhine Delta\\" is commonly used. However, this name is also used for the river delta where the Rhine flows into Lake Constance, so it is clearer to call the larger one Rhine-Meuse delta, or even \\"Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt Delta\\", as the Scheldt ends in the same delta.

Sentence 2: \\"It's easy to get them there.\\" - This sentence is more formal and clear. - The meaning is similar to the first sentence: it's easy to get \\"them\\" to a certain location. Now let's determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence: 1. Identify the main points of both sentences. - Both sentences emphasize that it's easy to get \\"them\\" to a certain location. 2. Compare the main points. - The main points of both sentences are essentially the same. 3. Determine if the second sentence is a direct or indirect consequence of the first sentence. - The second sentence rephrases the main message of the first sentence, making it clearer and more formal.

Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) receives a message from Captain Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) of the Logos calling an emergency meeting of all of Zion's ships. Zion has confirmed the last transmission of the Osiris: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. Commander Lock (Harry Lennix) orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain in order to contact the Oracle (Gloria Foster). The Caduceus receives a message from the Oracle, and the Nebuchadnezzar ventures out so Neo can contact her. One of the Caduceus crew, Bane (Ian Bliss), encounters Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who takes over Bane's avatar. Smith then uses this avatar to leave the Matrix, gaining control of Bane's real body. In Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. Neo receives a message from the Oracle and returns to the Matrix to meet her bodyguard Seraph (Collin Chou), who then leads him to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that it is his decision.

His father, Dryden Warfield, was a deacon in a Baptist church. Warfield attended Warren G. Harding High School in Warren, where he was a star running back and defensive back for the Panthers. He scored 92 points as a junior in 1958, a campaign highlighted by a 6-0 victory over powerhouse Massillon Washington High School. The following season, as a senior he scored 93 points, including all three of his team's touchdowns in the final game of the season. As a basketball player he was noted for his speed, often leading fast breaks. He also ran track and field at Warren G. Harding, and was the state broad jump champion in 1957. He set state records in the broad jump, 100-yard dash, and 180-yard hurdles. Warfield then attended Ohio State University, where he played for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team under coach Woody Hayes. As he did in high school, he continued to star as both a running back and defensive back. As the secondary ball-carrier behind fullback Bob Ferguson during Ohio State's national championship season in 1961, Warfield carried 77 times for 420 yards and five touchdowns. He was a third-team All-Big Ten Conference selection by the conference's coaches. In 1962 he rushed for 367 yards and two touchdowns, and his 6.4 yards-per-carry average led the Big Ten.

He was voted by the Big Ten's coaches as the first-team halfback on both the 1962 and 1963 All-Big Ten teams. A two-time letterman in track and field at Ohio State, Warfield competed as a broad jumper, hurdler, and sprinter.

Here is a question about this article: Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent’s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers hindering social development has been found in Spanish teenagers, where emotional (rather than solution-based) reactions to problems and emotional instability have been linked with physical aggression against peers. Both physical and relational aggression are linked to a vast number of enduring psychological difficulties, especially depression, as is social rejection. Because of this, bullied adolescents often develop problems that lead to further victimization. Bullied adolescents are both more likely to continued to be bullied and to bully others in the future. However, this relationship is less stable in cases of cyberbullying, a relatively new issue among adolescents. What is the answer to this question: What are some of the negative experiences that peer pressure can influence during adolescence?","completion":"Peer pressure can sometimes make kids do things that are not good or safe. Some negative experiences caused by peer pressure during teenage years can include trying drugs, drinking alcohol, doing naughty things like vandalism or stealing, and even being mean or aggressive towards others. These situations can make teenagers feel sad or upset and face difficulties in their life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- As royalty from different parts of the world converged on the Netherlands to watch the monarchy change hands, some of the guests there may have been thinking ahead to the day when they get the top job back home. In Europe, most monarchs are getting old and have been on their thrones for years. Their offspring are grown up and are now waiting in the wings to take their respective crowns. Britain's Prince Charles was in Amsterdam to watch Queen Beatrix hand over to her 46-year-old son Willem-Alexander. He was also in the Netherlands when Beatrix herself took the throne from her mother 33 years ago on Queen Juliana's abdication. Charles's new Dutch counterpart is Amalia, The Princess of Orange, who is nine. However, in an age when the pope resigns, don't be surprised if other older royals take some sort of cue from","completion":"the Vatican and consider abdication as a viable option for themselves, paving the way for a younger generation of royals to ascend to the throne. The succession of the monarchy in various European countries has long been determined by the natural progression of aging and eventual passing of the reigning monarch. Still, in recent times, there seems to be a growing consensus supporting the idea of an orderly transfer of power before any significant decline in health or capability occurs. The abdication of Queen Beatrix, for example, has been taken as a significant and refreshing move by many in the region. It not only allowed her to retire gracefully while still in good health but also set a precedent for other aging European monarchs to deliberate on the possibility of voluntary renunciation in favor of paving the way for a new generation. One potential factor for consideration is the change in the public's expectations and perceptions of their royal families. In the modern age, people are less inclined to view these figures as untouchable divine rulers and more as public servants whose primary role is to represent their countries on the world stage, promote national unity, and preserve their cultural heritage. Given this shift in perspective, it would be logical for aging monarchs to evaluate their ability to carry out these responsibilities effectively, especially in the face of increasing demand for transparency, accountability, and the widespread reach of social media. By making the choice to step down voluntarily, older royals can demonstrate both humility and a genuine concern for the best interests of their nations and their subjects. Moreover, the rise of democratic values across the globe has led to questions about the role and relevance of traditional monarchies in today's world. By choosing to abdicate in favor of a younger successor, older monarchs can make way for a fresh set of ideas, perspectives, and approaches to governance that resonate with the changing times, while also appeasing calls for the modernization and transformation of their institutions. With these factors in mind, it would not be surprising to see a growing trend of abdications among the royal families of Europe and beyond. By doing so, these aging rulers can ensure a smoother transition of power, increased public goodwill, and the continued relevance of their monarchies in an ever-evolving world. In conclusion, the voluntary abdication of older European monarchs, taking inspiration from recent events like Queen Beatrix's abdication and the pope's resignation, maybe a logical, compassionate, and strategic move that ushers in a new era of modernized and adaptable leadership. It also signifies an acceptance of the changing world and the desire to remain connected to the public they serve while recognizing the importance of the monarchy's enduring values and traditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Spiderman's story is the story of Peter Parker, a child who lost his parents and lives with his aunt and uncle. Peter is a shy, quiet boy wearing glasses and has few friends. One day, on a high school class trip to a science lab, he gets bitten by a special spider. Soon Peter realizes he has amazing powers: he is as strong and quick as a spider and also has a type of sixth sense. He no longer needs his glasses and he can use his super power to fly through the city streets! Remembering something his Uncle Ben has told him _ ,Peter decides to use his powers to fight against enemies who do cruel things to people. And so, Spiderman is born. Life is not easy for Peter even though he is a superhero. He is in love with Mary Jane but he can't tell her about his amazing powers. Besides, his best friend Harry hates Spiderman! Peter is also short of money and time. He has to sell photos of Spiderman (himself!) to a newspaper and he keeps losing his other jobs because he's so busy saving people! Yet he has to fight against different kinds of cruel enemies. Question: What does\\"With great power, there must also come great responsibility\\"mean? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Powerful people should have a responsibility to do good.\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the phrase \\"With great power, there must also come great responsibility\\" means that powerful people have a responsibility to use their abilities for the betterment of others.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The perturbation in this case is indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here is the justification for each step: 1. You take a tray: Drinking large quantities of water does not impact the availability or acquisition of an ice cube tray. 2. Add water into the tray: Drinking more water may lead to using more water, which could affect the amount of water available to fill the tray. This is an indirect impact since the person's water consumption does not directly change the action of pouring water into the tray. 3. You insert the tray into a freezer: Drinking water does not impact the action of inserting the tray into a freezer. 4. The water molecules begin to slow down: The consumption of water does not impact the physical process of water molecules slowing down when exposed to low temperatures. 5. The water becomes ice: The transformation of water into ice is not affected by the person's water consumption. 6. The ice cubes are ready: Once the water becomes ice, the person's water consumption does not affect the readiness of the ice cubes for use. In conclusion, the person drinking large quantities of water only indirectly impacts the step of adding water into the tray by potentially reducing the amount of water available for freezing.

Movie title: The Karate Kid, Part II Movie plot: Furious over the loss at the All-Valley Karate Tournament, John Kreese attacks Johnny in the parking lot. Miyagi confronts Kreese and passively immobilizes him. Miyagi threatens to strike a deadly blow but instead comically tweaks Kreese's nose and walks away. Six months later, Miyagi receives a letter notifying him that his father is dying. He plans to return to his home village in Okinawa, and Daniel accompanies him. Miyagi tells Daniel about why he left Okinawa many years ago. He fell in love with a woman named Yukie, who was arranged to marry his best friend Sato, son of the richest man in the village and fellow karate student of his father. Upon announcing his intentions to marry Yukie, Sato challenged him to a fight to the death. Rather than fight, however, Miyagi left the country. In Okinawa, Miyagi and Daniel are greeted by Chozen Toguchi, who drives Miyagi and Daniel to one of Sato's warehouses, where he reveals he's Sato's nephew. Sato appears and demands to fight Miyagi, who adamantly refuses. Arriving at the village, Miyagi and Daniel are welcomed by Yukie and her niece Kumiko. They discover that Sato has become a rich industrialist whose supertrawlers have destroyed the local fish population impoverishing the other villagers. They are forced to rent property from Sato, who owns the village's land title. Yukie reveals that she never married Sato, because of her love for Miyagi. After Miyagi's father dies, Sato gives him three days to mourn out of respect before their fight. Miyagi shows Daniel the secret to his family's karate â a handheld drum that twists back and forth illustrating the \\"drum technique\\", a block-and-defense karate move that Daniel begins to practice.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read this: Bacteria, as asexual organisms, inherit identical copies of their parent's genes (i.e., they are clonal). However, all bacteria can evolve by selection on changes to their genetic material DNA caused by genetic recombination or mutations. Mutations come from errors made during the replication of DNA or from exposure to mutagens. Mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria. Genetic changes in bacterial genomes come from either random mutation during replication or \\"stress-directed mutation\\", where genes involved in a particular growth-limiting process have an increased mutation rate. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What can cause mutation in bacteria?","completion":"Mutations in bacteria can be caused by two main factors: 1. Errors during DNA replication: As bacteria reproduce asexually through a process called binary fission, they need to replicate their DNA to pass it on to their offspring. During this replication process, errors may occur, leading to changes in their genetic material. These errors can be caused by mispairing of nucleotides, insertion or deletion of bases, or mistakes made by DNA polymerase enzymes. Such errors introduce variations in the bacterial genetic material and can cause mutations. 2. Exposure to mutagens: Mutagens are external factors that can cause changes in the DNA of bacteria. These may be physical mutagens, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, X-rays, or gamma rays, which can induce changes in the DNA structure, such as double-strand breaks or cross-linking of bases. Additionally, mutagens may also be chemical agents like reactive oxygen species, alkylating agents, or base analogs that can alter the structure or function of nucleotides in bacterial DNA and result in mutations. In some cases, bacteria may encounter stress-directed mutations, which is when genes involved in a specific growth-limiting process have an increased mutation rate. In summary, mutations in bacteria can be caused by errors during DNA replication or exposure to mutagens, such as radiation or chemicals. These genetic changes form the basis for bacterial evolution and adaptation to new environments or conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. – Attorney General Jeff Sessions was interviewed for hours last week in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, the Justice Department confirmed Tuesday. The interview comes as Mueller is investigating whether President Trump's actions in office, including the firing of FBI Director James Comey, constituted obstruction of justice. Mueller is also investigating contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. Sessions is thought to be the highest-ranking Trump administration official to be interviewed by Mueller's team—the New York Times calls the interview the first to touch Trump's Cabinet—and is seen as a potentially important witness given that Trump initially said he fired Comey last May at the recommendation of the Justice Department, reports the AP. At the time, the White House released a memo from Sessions' deputy, Rod Rosenstein, faulting Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and appearing to lay the groundwork for his dismissal. Trump has since said he was thinking of \\"the Russia thing\\" when he fired Comey. The Times was the first to report news of the interview, and the paper notes that in recusing himself from the Russia investigation, Sessions was left with \\"no control of Mr. Mueller.\\" CNN reports the interview took place last Wednesday and notes Sessions had not been subpoenaed. It adds that press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed Sessions was at the White House Monday, but she said she was unaware whether he and Trump spoke of the interview.

In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Some children cannot wait to grow up. Because once you become an adult, you are free to make your own decisions. More importantly, you can do all those things that you cannot do now because you are too young. So, the question is, 'At what age do you really become an adult?' Well, people become adults at different ages in different places. In Australia, the 18th birthday is a very important event for young Australians because it means they can do almost anything they want. They can vote, learn to drive a car, get married, join the army and even buy their own houses. However, even if they can do all these things, most Australians have to wait until their 21st birthday to really celebrate becoming an adult. This is the traditional adult age not only in Australia, but also in the USA and the UK. It is their first year of true independence .Traditionally, people were given a key to their houses by their parents when they turned 21, meaning they could come and go as they like. Even though 21 is the traditional adult age in many English-speaking countries, the law nowadays is different in each country. In the UK, you can join the army at 16 and even get married at 16 if your parents allow. Young people in the UK can learn to drive a car at 17 as in Australia, although they have to wait until they are 18 to vote. In China, there is a different age for each of the stages of becoming an adult. You can vote and learn to drive a car when you are 18, but if you want to get married, women have to wait until they are 20 and men until they are 22. Chinese people celebrate important birthdays every 10 years--so when young people turn 20, they can expect a big party! No matter what age you are, becoming an adult is really about learning how to be independent and responsible . Once you are finally able to take care of yourself and make your own decisions, then you can say that you are truly all grown-ups. Answer:","completion":"Question: At what age do people generally become adults in different places around the world, and what milestones are associated with reaching adulthood? A) Australia: 18 years old - voting, driving, getting married, joining the army, buying a house; 21 years old for traditional adulthood celebration B) United Kingdom: 16 years old - joining the army and marriage with parental consent; 17 years old - learning to drive; 18 years old - voting C) United States: 21 years old for traditional adulthood and some legal rights; specific milestones might vary by state D) China: 18 years old - voting and driving; 20 years old for women and 22 years old for men to marry; big celebrations at ages divisible by 10 Answer: All of the above"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First came the Tamworth Two, now the Durham Duo. Two little black pigs brought drama to the coastal town of Seaham after escaping from an allotment. Police raced into action as traffic was held up by the runaway pair, and one was last night under arrest after being found rooting for food in a waste bin. Pig hunt: Two of the animals went on the run yesterday but this one was caught after it stopped to raid a bin for a bite to eat. But its friend continued to show. officers a clean pair of trotters and, as night fell, the trail was as. cold as a frozen pork chop. The drama in Seaham, six miles south. of Sunderland, is reminiscent of the famous dash for freedom made by. Butch and Sundance – the Tamworth Two – in 1998. The story of the Tamworth Two was later made into a hour-long BBC television drama. They cheated the butcher’s knife by. going on the run from an abattoir, swimming the River Avon and. disappearing into a dense thicket. They were eventually caught but,. thanks to the Daily Mail, were given a reprieve from their death. sentence and lived out their days in an animal sanctuary. All went quiet in the sphere of. porcine escapology until Wednesday evening, when the two black pigs –. thought to be Berkshire crossbreeds – made a break from Hill Crescent. Allotments in Seaham. One of the runaways was lassoed by. 37-year-old mother-of-three Shereen Temple, who found it in a back alley. with its snout in an overflowing bin. She is keeping it on her own. allotment until it can be reunited with its friend. Piggy dinner: This little hog was nabbed on Fox Street but his friend from the allotments is still on the loose. Neighbourhood sergeant Jim Peel of. said: 'The owner of the pigs normally whistles at them to get them to. come back. Everyone is keeping an eye out for the one which is still. missing.' Police officers were alerted to the. escapees after being called when one of the pigs was seen trotting along. the middle of the road heading towards the Dawdon Welfare Pub in the. town. Sightings of the new fugitives were reported on social networking sites as they caused mayhem around Seaham. Dan Johnson Stafford commented via Facebook said: 'Not every day you see a pig holding up the traffic lol.' Safe: The captured pig, nicknamed Porky, is now being looked after back at the allotments but is missing his partner in crime. Helpers: Painter and decorator Shereen Temple lassoed Porky with the help of her son Robert, 11. Munching: It was this pig's prodigious appetite that caught up with it last night, and he is now being fed fresh fruit and vegetables among other delights. After capturing one of the pigs, Seaham Police tweeted: 'After struggling for 30 mins we caught the pig in Fox Street in Seaham.' Miss Temple, who helped to catch one of the runaway pigs last night. The painter and decorator helped to lasso the pig in a back alley after it was cornered by police. 'He was found in a back lane that was full of rubbish,' she said. 'He was scared when we found him, I tried to catch him but he scarpered down the alley. 'I tried to lasso it once with a dog lead but it slipped away the first time and the second time I managed to loop it around it's neck. 'The pig has been nicknamed Porky by some, everyone's talking about him.' Idyllic: The seaside town of Seaham is said to have been thrown into chaos by the fleeing pigs. Captured: The one pig intercepted was spotted trotting towards the Dawdon Welfare Pub. Shereen kept the pig in her allotment where she keeps 14 chickens. She also owns two horses which are kept in stables, enjoying fresh food including carrots, apples, grass roots and some horse feed. 'He's having a good time digging up my vegetables and he's being kept in the chicken shed for now. 'Apparently the other pig was seen near the allotments this morning, and he was caught but he got away before the officers came to rescue him. 'It's been quite exciting helping to catch them - we just want to reunite him with the other one - we don't know if it's his brother or not.' While the RSPCA took in the runaway pig, the other has still not yet been found. Police were made aware of a sighting of the other pig at Seaham Harbour around 11pm last night but when they attended, the pig could not be found. Another sighting was reported at around 8am this morning, but again when officers arrived at the scene, the pig had once again escaped. Parallels: This latest escape has reminded people of dynamic duo 'The Tamworth Two' Sundance, left, and Butch, who went on the run from an abattoir. Neighbourhood Sergeant Jim Peel said: 'We had a call around 8pm last night to say that there was a pig on the loose. 'It was running around the roads in Seaham. 'Two PCSOs and response officers attended and they chased the pig into a back alley where the pig was detained. 'That was it for about an hour until a second pig was reported to also be loose. 'About 11pm last night there was a second call saying that a pig was running around Strangford Road, Seaham. 'However when officers searched the area, no pig was found. 'Another call came in around 8am this morning to say that a pig had been seen on Mount Stewart Street in Seaham.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Kevin Wilson. Wilson is the current offensive coordinator and tight ends coach for the Ohio State University football team, a position he has held since the 2017 season. Prior to his role at Ohio State, he served as the head football coach for the Indiana Hoosiers from 2011 to 2016. Kevin Wilson began his coaching career at his alma mater, the University of North Carolina, as a graduate assistant in 1984. He continued his coaching journey at several colleges and universities before joining the Indiana Hoosiers football team as their head coach in 2011. During his tenure at Indiana, Wilson was able to reshape the Hoosiers' offense into one of the most productive units in the country, leading the team to back-to-back bowl appearances in 2015 and 2016. However, Wilson resigned as head coach in December 2016 following various accusations of player mistreatment, which led to an investigation by the university. Indiana University ultimately found that he did not meet their \\"standards for behavior,\\" and the two parties agreed on a mutual separation. Shortly afterward, in January 2017, Wilson was hired by the Ohio State University as their offensive coordinator and tight ends coach under then-head coach Urban Meyer. In his new role, Wilson has helped the Buckeyes' offense become one of the most potent in college football. Under his and head coach Ryan Day's guidance, the team has consistently ranked among the top offenses in the NCAA, breaking numerous school records in the process. Not only has Kevin Wilson been adept at coordinating offenses and calling plays, but he has also demonstrated his ability to develop young talent, including mentoring several players who have gone on to have successful careers in the NFL.

And this summer he 'll go to tennis camp and learn some more . So , it 's tennis camp and golf tournaments for my kids ( and me , because someone has to get them there ) this summer . Question What may be the reason its s good to lose a few matches ? Answer:","completion":"There are several reasons why it is good to lose a few matches in any sport, including tennis. Losing is an essential part of the learning process, and it offers numerous opportunities for growth and development. Here are some reasons why losing a few matches can be beneficial: 1. Learning from mistakes: Losses often highlight areas where the player can improve. By examining the mistakes made during a match, a player can identify their weaknesses and work on them to become a stronger competitor. For example, they may need to work on their footwork, serve, or mental toughness. 2. Building resilience: Losing can help build resilience and mental strength in an individual. It teaches them to cope with setbacks and adversity, which is important not only in sports but also in life. Learning to handle disappointments and bouncing back from them can help a person develop a strong mindset that can be applied to other areas of life. 3. Developing a growth mindset: Losing can foster a growth mindset, where players believe that they can improve their skills through hard work and dedication. This mindset encourages them to focus on progress and growth rather than solely on winning. Players with a growth mindset are more likely to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a way to improve. 4. Encouraging humility and sportsmanship: Losing teaches humility and sportsmanship. Recognizing that nobody can win every match helps players handle both wins and losses gracefully. Exhibiting good sportsmanship – acknowledging an opponent's skills, being respectful, and showing courtesy – is an important part of being a well-rounded athlete. 5. Enhancing motivation: Sometimes, losing can fuel a player's motivation and drive them to work harder. The desire to improve and perform better in future matches can be a strong motivator for increased practice, focus, and dedication to the sport. 6. Appreciating victories: Having experienced losses can make a person appreciate their victories more. Understanding the effort and growth that is necessary to achieve a win can lead to a greater sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when it happens. 7.

Hans Muller (Kirk Douglas), a German Jew, was once a well-known juggler before he was committed to a concentration camp; Muller survived, but his wife and children did not. After the war, Muller and many other displaced people found themselves in a temporary camp in Israel; his experiences have left him upset and confused, and several of the guards notice that he's behaving oddly. Muller flees the camp after one day, but while running away, he's stopped by Kogan (Richard Benedict), an Israeli policeman. When Kogan asks to see Muller's papers, he immediately flashes back to an unsetting memory in which a Nazi officer asked the same question; Muller panics, attacks the cop, and flees for Mount Carmel. In the morning, Muller encounters a group of children who believe the story he tells them: that he's a tourist from the United States. One of them, Yehoshua (Joseph Walsh), is making his way to a kibbutz in Syria, and Muller, who hopes to get to some friends in Egypt, joins him. Muller entertains the young man by teaching him to juggle, and they become close friends. When Yehoshua is injured by a land mine, Muller rushes him to a hospital, where he meets Ya'el (Milly Vitale), a woman who lost her husband to Arabs. A romance soon blossoms between Muller and Ya'el, and he confesses to her that he's on the run from the police; meanwhile, Israeli Detective Karni (Paul Stewart) is combing the nation, searching for the juggler -- not to arrest him, but to convince him that he's not wanted for murder, and that others want to help him. Michael Blankfort, who wrote the original novel upon which The Juggler was based, adapted the screenplay and also served as executive producer. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide My question: What country did Muller find himself in after the war?

Men are flocking to Pinterest Pinterest is quickly shaking the image that it’s just for women. A new survey, published this week, provides further proof that men are “pinning.” Men now make up 18% of Pinterest’s users, which is a 5% jump over last year, according poll commissioned by Ahalogy, a Pinterest marketing partner. Almost two thirds of men on the site have joined it in the last year, the poll notes. Sure, the vast majority of Pinterest’s users are still women. But the stereotype of Pinterest as being just for middle-aged Midwestern moms is shifting. Younger users are on the rise—67% of the active pinners surveyed were under the age of 40, compared with 49% a year ago. Hispanic users also grew from 3% in 2014 to 9% of the sites users, according to the survey. The poll surveyed 1,015 Web users, 505 of which used Pinterest at least once a month. Of that group, 206 used Pinterest every day. The full survey is available on Ahalogy’s website. More notable to Pinterest advertisers, the study shows 47% of Pinterest users are aware of the site’s new ad formats but don’t mind them. That’s up from 35% last year. I’m wary of this result, since Ahalogy has a vested interest in promoting that idea. But it is hardly a surprise; in fact, it has been the promise of Pinterest all along. It’s the driving force behind Pinterest’s 11 billion valuation. On other social networks like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, people are there to socialize. On Pinterest, which CEO and co-founder Ben Silbermann has said is not a social network, but a place to save things for later, people are in shopping mode. In many cases, they’re saving things for later in order to possibly buy them. Pinterest users are in consumption mode, the thinking goes, so conversion rates will be through the roof. It’s been called “a capitalist’s dream.” Almost half of Pinterest users surveyed by Ahalogy say they use Pinterest instead of browsing catalogs. Pinterest is their “go-to” source for DIY and crafts, home decor, and weddings, the survey said. Pinterest’s ad product, Promoted Pins, is only a year old and the company hasn’t provided any results or case studies from advertisers. But the survey indicates (conveniently) that brands have a vital place on the platform. A whopping 83% of active pinners said they’d rather follow their favorite brand than their favorite celebrity. Nearly three quarters said they’d rather follow their favorite beauty brand than favorite makeup artist. The study reports similar results for baby products over baby experts, designer brands over fashion icons, and hair care brands over celebrity stylists. Nearly three quarters of active pinners say they bought something because they saw it on Pinterest. Now, pinners can shop directly on Pinterest. The company introduced a “buy button” earlier this summer after years of anticipation. In July, Silberman was quick to point out at Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference that Pinterest’s core business will be advertising, and it will not make money on the buy button. Rather, the buy button is a way to streamline the shopping process for users. It’s probably a wise move to focus on advertising. Pinterest may a tool for consumption, but advertising, with its high margins and lack of physical inventory, is a better business to be in than commerce. If, as this survey indicates, users both notice the ads and truly don’t mind them, then Pinterest will have solved the Web’s “original sin.” Sign up for Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily morning newsletter about the business of technology.

Sentence:","completion":"The ALCO RS-3 (American Locomotive Company Road Switcher model 3) is a historic and significant diesel-electric locomotive built by the American Locomotive Company in the United States. This locomotive model, which was first introduced in 1950, was an important development in the transportation industry, significantly contributing to the gradual replacement of steam-powered engines with diesel-electric technology in the mid-20th Century. As a Road Switcher model, the ALCO RS-3 was designed to perform tasks both in the yard and out on the main line, demonstrating its versatility in various types of rail operations. Equipped with an ALCO 244 V12 engine, the ALCO RS-3's powertrain was one of the largest and most powerful of its time. The V12 engine configuration is an internal combustion engine with 12 inline cylinders arranged in a V-shape, with six cylinders on one side and six on the other. The engine displacement is approximately 8,000 cubic inches (131 liters), which allows it to generate a remarkable 1,600 horsepower for effective hauling and switching capabilities. Moreover, the use of the V12 engine provided a more compact design compared to a Straight-12 configuration, which in turn made it easier to accommodate within the locomotive's frame and body. The ALCO 244 V12 engine also featured an intricate fuel injection system which showed improvement in fuel efficiency and performance over earlier models in this series. The diesel-electric system in the ALCO RS-3 works by converting the mechanical energy produced by the diesel engine into electrical energy. This electrical energy is then used to power the electric traction motors connected to the locomotive's wheels, providing smooth, efficient, and powerful tractive force for diverse rail operations. This advanced technology became a staple and inspiration for the development of subsequent generations of diesel-electric locomotives in the industry. The ALCO RS-3 was popular among various railroad companies, with over 1,300 units being built before production ceased in 1956. As a testament to its durability and longevity, many of these locomotives continued operating well into the late 20th Century. In addition, the renowned ALCO 244 V12 engine was used not only in this model but also in several other ALCO designs, demonstrating the legacy and impact of the engine's efficiency and power. In conclusion, the ALCO RS-3, a diesel-electric locomotive boasting the powerful ALCO 244 V12 engine, has left an enduring mark in the transition from steam to diesel-electric technology within the railway industry. With its exceptional performance, reliability, and flexibility in various operations, this locomotive has greatly contributed to the history and development of modern rail transportation systems, showcasing significance in both the mechanical and technological aspects of the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These amazing pictures show the life-or-death struggle faced by Kurdish fighters as they battle through rubble-strewn streets against ISIS extremists in the battle for Syrian border town of Kobane. Images from the front-line show the trail of destruction left in the town, where weeks of fighting have taken place as Islamic State militants make their advances. US-led air strikes have hit jihadist positions in the north and east of Syria today, including an oil field, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Armed Kurdish fighters are seen holding guns as they cower in one of the many destroyed buildings in the town of Kobane in Syria. A man armed with two guns walks through the streets of Kobane as Kurdish fighters mark the front-line in the battle against jihadists. The destruction left after weeks of fighting in the town, which has seen most of its 55,000 residents flee and attempt to seek refuge. A Kurdish fighter takes a moments rest whilst lying among debris yesterday. According to the group the movement of ISIS has slowed. Us-led airstrikes were launched on jihadist positions in the north and east of Syria today after militant shelling killed two civilians. The raids against ISIS came after militants shelled a camp for those displaced from Kobane - known as Ain al-Arab in Arabic - and killed two people, said the monitoring group. A spokesperson for the Observatory said: 'Four explosions were heard during the night in Deir Ezzor province [in eastern Syria], caused by US-Arab air strikes in the area of the Tanak oil field and an IS checkpoint... killing two people.' The Britain-based monitoring group, which relies on a network of sources on the ground for its reports, said it was unclear whether the casualties were jihadists or civilians. It has reported that four other people were injured, including a child, at the camp for people forced from Kobane by violence. These up-close and personal images show what life is really like in Kobane for Kurdish fighters, who are backed by Iraqi peshmerga. Kobane, which lies on the border with Turkey, has been besieged by IS for nearly two months as fighters stand guard for battle. In September ISIS launched a full scale assault on Kobane from the west and south of the town, destroying homes and buildings. An exploded mortar shell is seen lying in the streets in front of what might have once been a shop, which has seen been destroyed. The US-led coalition, which launched strikes against jihadist positions in Syria in September, also hit IS militants - which controls most oil fields in Deir Ezzor province - in Kobane. The town on the border with Turkey has been besieged by IS for nearly two months and these latest photographs show Syrian Kurdish fighters armed and ready for battle as their town lies in ruins. Men are seeing carrying guns in the streets, while other armed fighters hide in one of the many destroyed buildings. The Kurdish forces, backed by rebels and Iraqi peshmerga fighters, have been battling to expel IS from the town, where most of the 55,000 residents have fled. A Kurdish fighter is seen running through the streets of Kobane where violent fighting has broken out as ISIS tries to capture the town. The town has been left virtually empty as almost 90 per cent of its population has fled to seek refuge - mostly in neighbouring Turkey. Iraqi Kurdish regional government delivered two truckloads of ammunition that secretly crossed into the town via Turkey on Wednesday. Separately, the Syrian Observatory said fighting on Thursday night near Lebanon killed 31 combatants loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and 14 rebels, including Al-Qaeda militants. There has been frequent violence in Syria's Mount Hermon, but the toll over recent days has been unprecedented. In recent weeks, Lebanon has all but closed the border officially to incoming Syrian refugees, with troops bolstering border security. More than 1.1 million Syrian refugees are living in Lebanon, straining the country's limited resources and infrastructure. Thick plumes of grey smoke rise from an ISIS position in eastern Kobane, after an airstrike by the U.S-led coalition. The pillars of smoke, which swept across the skyline, could be seen from a hilltop outside Suruc on the Turkey-Syria border earlier today. Last week ISIS released images of their fighters engaging in street fighting in Kobane as part of their latest publicity stunt. The pictures, distributed by the media office in the ISIS 'capital' of Raqqa in Syria, show jihadis firing rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles in the ruined streets of the town. Meanwhile, an international rights group claimed Islamic State militants tortured and abused Kurdish children captured earlier this year near the town. Human Rights Watch based its conclusions on interviews with several children who were among more than 150 Kurdish boys from Kobane abducted in late May as they were returning home after taking school exams in the city of Aleppo. It said around 50 of the Kurds escaped early in their captivity, while the rest were released in batches - the last on October 29. An ISIS militant fires a rocket-propelled grenade in the the streets of Kobane. This picture was issued by the Raqqa Media Office of ISIS.

Grace, winning for the fifth time in a superb 2012, four coming on the European Tour, ended two ahead of Olesen after carding a final round 70 for a record 22-under total in the tournament. \\"It feels awesome,\\" the South African told the official European Tour website after a victory that has lifted him to third in the The Race to Dubai. He has now targeted No.1 Rory McIlroy in the battle for the overall honors in Europe. \\"It's definitely in my sights,\\" he said. Grace, who is yet another graduate of the Ernie Els Foundation, led from the first round at Kingsbarns where he shot a stunning 12-under 60. But when Olesen carded two straight birdies around the turn and Grace three-putted the short 11th for a bogey, they were level. But Grace pulled away with a stunning hat-trick of birdies only interrupted by a bogey on the Road Hole 17th. He still had a two-shot lead playing the last which they both birdied. Alexander Noren of Sweden finished third, four shots back, with Joel Sjoholm of Sweden in fourth. Scot Stephen Gallacher, a former Dunhill winner, was making superb last day progress until he accidentally played the ball of an amateur partner Steve Halsall on the 16th fairway.

The Jay Leno Show is an American talk show created by and starring Jay Leno. Premiering on NBC on September 14, 2009, the program aired on weeknights at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT through February 9, 2010. The program was modeled upon the format of a late night talk show--specifically, Jay Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show, opening with a comedic monologue, followed by interviews with celebrity guests and other comedy segments. Sketches from The Tonight Show (including Headlines and Jaywalking) were carried over to The Jay Leno Show, along with new sketches. Leno had a contract for five years for the show. NBC reportedly had an option to cancel after two years, but had committed to at least one or two years regardless of ratings, although later chose to end the show after less than five months. He could have earned up to 30 million each year depending on ratings for Leno, compared to a 20 million annual salary during his last years at Tonight. NBC expected to benefit by offering an inexpensive comedic alternative to the procedurals (\\"100% more comedy and 98% fewer murders!\\") and other one-hour dramas that typically air at 10 pm, and by offering new episodes 46 weeks each year versus 22. While Leno was not necessarily expected to be competitive with the higher-rated scripted shows on ABC and CBS in its time slot, its projected cost of production was far lower and thus it was expected to be profitable to the network, and product integration intended to make the show \\"as DVR-proof as you can be on television in this era\\". Each airing of Leno cost about 350,000 to 400,000 versus up to 3 million for an hour-long drama, saving NBC 13 million each week without the network needing the show to beat its competitors. Those costs include the services of 22 writers, whom Leno called the \\"top 5% of the highest-paid . . . in the Guild.\\" McDonald's became the first buying advertiser for the program, tying in their \\"Million Dollar Roll\\" nightly in October 2009 promoting that year's version of McDonald's Monopoly. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Was the show financially successful?","completion":"Based on the quote \\"While Leno was not necessarily expected to be competitive with the higher-rated scripted shows on ABC and CBS in its time slot, its projected cost of production was far lower and thus it was expected to be profitable to the network,\\" it can be inferred that The Jay Leno Show was expected to be financially successful due to its lower production costs. However, it's important to note that the show ended after less than five months, which could indicate that it may not have met financial expectations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where does the weasel become frightened? ? The cartoon starts with the arm of an animator drawing a farm scene. The farm scene then colors itself, and the camera zooms in just as the plot follows: A realistic-looking horse is seen, whinnying (courtesy of Mel Blanc), and a comic triple plays out: The narrator asks the horse to do a trot; the horse obliges. The narrator asks for a gallop; the horse again obliges. The narrator then asks the horse to do a \\"canter\\". The horse turns from realistic to a cartoon horse, with the bugged eyes of, and singing \\"I'm Happy About the Whole Thing\\" (by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer) in the style of, the vaudeville star Eddie Cantor, vocally impersonated by Kent Rogers. The narrator admonishes the horse, which grins sheepishly. The family dog is seen lazing on the porch, springing to alertness when the newspaper arrives. The dog makes a mad dash to the end of the driveway, gets the paper, comes back to the porch, and immediately starts to read the paper himself, starting with the Sunday comics. He turns to the audience, and says, \\"I can hardly wait to see what happened to Dick Tracy!\\" (This gag would be used by Clampett again in The Great Piggy Bank Robbery.) A hen leaves her eggs unguarded, and a mean-looking weasel stealthily creeps into the henhouse while the narrator frets. Just as he is about to grab the eggs, they all hatch at once, and the chicks shout \\"BOO!\\" in unison. The frightened weasel evokes a Joe Penner catch-phrase, \\"Don't ever DOOO that!\\" and gasps as his heart pounds. An owl is hooting dully until it briefly smiles while saying \\"Who's Yehoodi?\\" A few birds put a little twig, a bit of string, and piece of straw until they make a house approved by the Federal Housing Administration, singing, \\"There's no place like home!\\" A worried field mouse with huge ears is asked about what worries him; he claims \\"I don't know, Doc.

Does word \\"pull\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences? The pull of the moon. Iron fillings drawn by the pull of a magnet.","completion":"In order to determine whether the word \\"pull\\" has the same meaning in both sentences, let's analyze the context and meaning of the word in each case. Step 1: Analyze the context of the first sentence - \\"The pull of the moon.\\" In this sentence, \\"pull\\" seems to refer to a force exerted by the moon. This force is gravitational in nature and affects the tides and other natural phenomena on Earth. Step 2: Analyze the context of the second sentence - \\"Iron fillings drawn by the pull of a magnet.\\" In this sentence, \\"pull\\" refers to the attractive force exerted by a magnet on iron fillings. This force is magnetic in nature and causes the iron fillings to be drawn towards the magnet. Step 3: Compare the meanings of \\"pull\\" in both sentences. Upon analyzing the context of both sentences, it becomes clear that the force exerted in each case is distinct, with one being gravitational and the other being magnetic. Despite this difference in the type of force, the general concept of an attractive force causing movement towards an object is consistent across both sentences. Conclusion: The word \\"pull\\" has a similar general meaning in both sentences - an attractive force causing movement towards an object. However, the specific nature of the force differs between the sentences: in the first sentence, it is gravitational, whereas, in the second sentence, it is magnetic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: It was a good feast. Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes.

The body of a young man found in the Providence River on Tuesday may be that of Sunil Tripathi, a student at Brown University who disappeared March 16, police told CNN. A Brown rowing coach reported a body in the river near India Point Park, Lindsay Lague, a spokeswoman for the Providence Police Department, said Wednesday. Lague said authorities may be able to identify the body as soon as Thursday morning. When asked if it might be Tripathi, Detective Mark Sacco said it was \\"likely\\" but was cautious to say they won't know who it is until the medical examiner makes a determination. The body is a man between the ages of 18 and 30, he said. The Tripathi family's search for the 22-year-old philosophy major has been detailed on a Facebook page, \\"Help us find Sunil Tripathi.\\" They temporarily took down the page after they were inundated by ugly comments when Sunil Tripathi was falsely accused on social media of being one of the Boston Marathon bombers. After the FBI released images of Suspect 1 and Suspect 2, people took to sites such as Reddit, a real-time message board, and Twitter speculating that Tripathi looked like one of the suspects. Reddit's general manager apologized to the Tripathi family for the misinformation. Tripathi was last seen in the early hours of March 16, recorded on a security video walking south on Brook Street in Providence, not far from his home. His last recorded computer activity was shortly before that sighting. \\"He was seen on the 15th, Friday, hanging out with his friends, talking to family members, all normal activities, nothing out of the ordinary that anyone detected,\\" his brother Ravi told CNN affiliate WPRI on April 10. Since then a desperate search has been on for Tripathi, known to family and friends as \\"Sunny.\\" Tripathi, who had been struggling with depression, was last seen wearing blue jeans, a black Eastern Mountain Sports ski jacket, glasses and a black Philadelphia Eagles wool hat. He was said to be 6 feet tall, 130 pounds, with short, dark hair. By March 17, nobody had seen him for 24 hours, and a friend became concerned and called the police. At that point, the family was notified and came up from Philadelphia as soon as they could, Ravi said. \\"We are a very tight-knit family, and it's very out of the ordinary that he would be not in contact for even 24 hours,\\" Ravi told WPRI. \\"He spoke with his aunt, he spoke with his grandmother Friday night, he texted with my mum, all normal activities, and then his cell phone was left in his apartment along with his wallet and ID, which is totally atypical for him.\\" The FBI and other agencies launched a search of Providence, Rhode Island, and nearby cities after he was reported missing, but no trace was found. Over the past month, Ravi has appeared on local and national networks appealing for help to find his sibling, the youngest of three. At the time he went missing, Sunil Tripathi was on approved leave from the Ivy League school, meaning that he had requested and was granted time off but remained a student there. Sunil had taken the time off to figure out exactly what he wanted to do, Ravi told WPRI. He described his brother as a quiet person who enjoyed the little things in life. His preferred food was vegetarian and he was a talented saxophonist, the family said. \\"Our concerns are first and foremost with Sunil and his family,\\" Margaret Klawunn, vice president for student life and campus services at Brown University, said last month. \\"We are hopeful that by encouraging the Brown community to help spread the word that Sunil will be located.\\" Sunil had been living in Providence since 2008 but grew up in Radnor, Pennsylvania. The family, including Sunil's sister, Sangeeta, tried to find him by re-creating the sequence of events early on March 16, in the hope of finding a clue to where he might have gone. They also got the word out by posting fliers, canvassing the area, working with law enforcement and sought to harness the power of social media. A tweet a week ago on the family's Twitter page, Finding Sunny, said: \\"Sunny day. We're out in Providence postering away -- learning the nooks and crannies of every block of this town.... \\" A moving video was posted on YouTube on April 8, simply titled \\"For Sunny,\\" in which family and friends appeal for him to come home, telling him how much they love him and want to see him. The family \\"want to know that he's safe,\\" Ravi told WPRI just six days before the Boston bombing. \\"All we really want to know is that he's around and that he's okay. \\"And we would like him to know that we love him deeply and we miss him a lot.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1. A young man's body was found in the Providence River, possibly associated with the disappearance of a Brown University student, Sunil Tripathi, who vanished on March 16.

His lack of activity and the discovery of his left-behind personal belongings raised concerns in his close-nit family, leading to his friend to notify the police after 24 hours of no contact. 5.

Question: Arithmetic and algebra are examples of what science? Context: Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.

The TO forces in the area were subordinated to the 1st Brigade of the TO, and Lieutenant Colonel General Milan Torbica. The HV deployed 250 troops, elements of the 113th and 142nd Infantry Brigades, commanded by Brigadier Kruno Mazalin. The HV had infiltrated the pink zone along three routes—via Nos Kalik, across the Čikola river and by boat sailing upstream along the Krka River, during the night of 20/21 June. The fighting began at 5 a.m. as the HV force, deployed in 26 squads, captured six out of seven villages on the plateau by the end of the morning. At 8:00 p.m., the HV captured the village of Ključ, and all of the plateau. The advance created a HV-held salient south of Knin, several kilometres deep. It also led the RSK artillery to bombard Šibenik and HV bombardment of Knin in response, both on 22 June. The artillery fire progressively intensified until 23 June, while the RSK mobilised and counterattacked against the HV positions at the Miljevci Plateau. However, the mobilisation yielded only 227 additional troops, and the counterattack failed. An UNPROFOR assessment concluded the situation might deteriorate further and engulf all of the pink zones. To address the situation, UNPROFOR military commander Lieutenant General Satish Nambiar met with Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia Milan Ramljak and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia General Anton Tus in Zagreb the same day, in order to discuss the developments on the Miljevci Plateau. Skirmishes continued on 24 June, accompanied by some artillery fire. Morale of the RSK troops plummeted though, causing a TO garrison based in nearby Trbounj to abandon its barracks.

Four hours later and 950 miles away, Cristiano Ronaldo's eyes were wide in anger as he shouted in protest just ahead of the final whistle, again arguing with a referee. The tirade got Ronaldo a second yellow card that would have suspended him for the next match. No worries, Portugal's World Cup ended, reports the AP. Saturday will likely mark the end of an era for the World Cup, a decade in which much of the hype has been about the best players in the world, the Spanish league rivals who have evenly split the last 10 FIFA Player of the Year Awards. Once again, both men have failed to replicate their club success for their countries. Messi is a week past his 31st birthday and Ronaldo 33, former phenoms unlikely to reach Qatar 2022. For both superstars, a World Cup title remained an unreachable star. On Saturday, they were both outshone by two Paris Saint-Germain teammates, CNN notes, France's Kylian Mbappe and Uruguay's Edinson Cavani. Messi hasn't won a senior title with his nation, losing finals at the 2014 World Cup, and the 2007, '15 and '16 Copa Americas, the last when Messi failed on his penalty kick during a shootout. He faced massive criticism at home and retired from the national team only to be lured back for this World Cup cycle. Ronaldo lost a World Cup semifinal in 2006 but never got past the second round again. They were soccer's yin and yang, Messi understated and distant, Ronaldo flamboyant with a model girlfriend and attention-grabbing hairdos. They are global spokesmen, Ronaldo for Nike, Toyota, and more; Messi for the likes of Adidas and Pepsi. But their time at the top has come to an end. Expand this summary.","completion":"The recent exits of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo from the World Cup signal the likely end of an era in which both players have dominated the international soccer scene for a decade. Despite their unmatched club success and numerous accolades, both icons have struggled to replicate their brilliance and bring home major international trophies for their respective nations, Argentina and Portugal. While Messi and Ronaldo have been fierce Spanish league rivals, their record of splitting the last 10 FIFA Player of the Year Awards highlights their remarkable individual accomplishments. However, international triumphs have proven elusive for both stars. With Messi turning 31 recently, and Ronaldo at 33, it is improbable that they will make it to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Messi's international trophy cabinet remains bare, with the Argentine superstar failing to win a senior title with his nation. He has experienced defeats in the finals at the 2014 World Cup and Copa America tournaments in 2007, 2015, and 2016. Notably, his missed penalty kick during a shootout in the 2016 Copa America finals invited an immense barrage of criticism. He briefly retired from the national team before eventually being drawn back for this World Cup cycle. Ronaldo, on the other hand, reached the World Cup semifinals with Portugal in 2006 but failed to progress beyond the second round in subsequent campaigns. Known for his flamboyance, Ronaldo has been a global spokesperson for companies such as Nike and Toyota, while Messi represented major brands like Adidas and Pepsi. On June 30, both soccer greats were outperformed by their Paris Saint-Germain teammates, France's Kylian Mbappe and Uruguay's Edinson Cavani. As Messi and Ronaldo's international careers reach their twilight, it is a bittersweet reminder of the transient nature of sporting greatness, and a testament to a thrilling chapter in soccer history characterized by these two illustrious icons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

James Corbin, a Blacksmith D. Horseshoeing is a Good Way to Make a Living Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: New York is one of the last large American cities to have some of its policemen on horseback. The New York police have 170 horses working in certain parts of the city. The horses are expensive to feed, but it is even more expensive to look after them. Because the horses must walk on the streets, they need special horseshoes. In fact , they need more than 8,000 of them each year. Every police horse in New York gets new shoes every month. Keeping these shoes in good repair is the job of six blacksmiths. There are only about thirty-five of these blacksmiths in the whole United States. The cost of shoing a horse is between twenty dollars and thirty-five dollars, and it takes a good blacksmith two or three hours to do the job. A blacksmith's job is not an easy one. He must be able to shape a shoe from a piece of metal and then fit it to the horse's foot. The blacksmith must bend over all the time when he is fitting the shoe and must hold the weight of the horse's leg while he works. Clearly, a blacksmith must be very storng. But even more important, he must be able to deal with horses---for before the blacksmith can begin his work, he has to get the horse to lift its leg. One of the blacksmiths in New York is James Corbin. He came to the country from Ireland in 1948. He not only makes horseshoes for the police but also works for a group of horse owners near the city. Corbin became interested in blacksmithing because his father did it, and,as the puts it, \\"It's a good way to make a living.\\" Question: The best title for the passage is \\" _ \\".

Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what money is used in mozambique?\\" A:","completion":"A: Mozambique uses a currency called the Mozambican Metical as its primary form of money. The Metical is abbreviated by the symbol MZN and its plural form is \\"Meticais\\". It is further divided into 100 smaller units, known as centavos. The Mozambican Metical has been the official currency of the country since June 16, 1980, when it replaced the Mozambican Escudo. The metical has undergone two homonymic redenominations, first in 2006 and then again in 2008, each time resetting the currency's value in order to address inflation and instability concerns. In the second redenomination, 1 new metical (MZN) was equal to 1,000 old meticais (MZM). Banknotes in circulation vary in denominations and come in values of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 meticais. Each banknote features prominent Mozambican historic figures, cultural references, and depictions of the local flora and fauna. Additionally, a series of coins are also minted and used in the country, including denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 centavos, as well as 1, 2, 5, and 10 meticais coins. The metical is controlled and regulated by the Bank of Mozambique (Banco de Moçambique), the central bank of the country. The stability and value of the Mozambican Metical are dependent on factors such as internal economic growth, political stability, and the global financial market. In some cases, especially in tourist areas or large cities, the US dollar, South African rand, and sometimes the Euro may also be accepted for transactions. However, it is essential to have meticais on hand for smaller purchases and for use in rural areas. It is important to note that the exchange rates may vary, and it is wise to check updated rates before any currency transactions. In order to exchange foreign currency for meticais, travelers can use banks, bureaux de change, or ATMs located in major cities or at the airport. However, it is advised to carry cash in small denominations while visiting Mozambique, as finding change for larger denominations can be challenging. Credit card facilities may be limited, especially outside of urban centers or international hotels. As a result, it is always crucial to plan ahead and have adequate cash available for any expenses that may arise during a visit to Mozambique."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is also an art form that is created in nature, using natural materials such as soil, rock (bed rock, boulders, stones), organic media (logs, branches, leaves), and water with introduced materials such as concrete, metal, asphalt, or mineral pigments. Sculptures are not placed in the landscape, rather, the landscape is the means of their creation. Often earth moving equipment is involved. The works frequently exist in the open, located well away from civilization, left to change and erode under natural conditions. Many of the first works, created in the deserts of Nevada, New Mexico, Utah or Arizona were ephemeral in nature and now only exist as video recordings or photographic documents. They also pioneered a category of art called site-specific sculpture, designed for a particular outdoor location. What is the relationship between 'city ' and 'land art'?

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise states that \\"Then Harford is found to be an interloper.\\" This suggests that at some point in time, it is discovered or revealed that Harford is indeed an interloper. Based on this information, we can infer a few things. Firstly, that there must have been previous uncertainties or doubts regarding Harford's true status or involvement, potentially concealed or undisclosed. Secondly, the discovery involves a moment or event that ultimately confirms Harford's interloper status. Now, let's examine the hypothesis which states, \\"The Harford was identified as an interloper.\\" This proposition posits that someone or something recognized or determined that Harford is an interloper. Similar to the premise, this implies that Harford's status as an interloper matters and is of consequence for the given situation. There's also the aspect that Harford's position as an interloper is distinct and recognizable by certain means. Comparing the premise to the hypothesis, we notice that both involve Harford being recognized as an interloper. The main difference lies in the keywords \\"found\\" and \\"identified.\\" \\"Found\\" suggests discovery after previous uncertainties, while \\"identified\\" implies recognition or distinction of the interloper status. However, considering the context of both statements, it is reasonable to assume that the process of identifying involved unveiling or discovering Harford's true status. With that said, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise, by stating that Harford is found to be an interloper, implies that a moment or event led to the discovery of Harford's true nature. In the hypothesis, Harford's identification as an interloper inherently involves recognizing and distinguishing the interloper status as a result of the same discovery. Both statements convey the same general idea that Harford was ultimately considered an interloper, despite potentially having concealed or undisclosed intentions beforehand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Tom Perez is Neutral . Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is taking a part-time Ivy League teaching gig after saying earlier this year that the chairmanship should be a âfull time job.â Perez made the comment in late 2016 when he joined the competition for the DNC post against Ralph Ellison a full-time Minnesota Democratic congressman and while Perez was still pondering a 2018 run for Maryland governor. He also reportedly said at the time that the party needs to have âsomeone committed here for the long haul.\\" Washington Republicans pounced on the announcement Thursday that Perez would be a senior fellow at his alma mater Brown University. âThe DNC canât raise money their âBetter Dealâ slogan flopped the Unity Tours were a disaster -- and Tom Perez thinks itâs a good time for a side gig?â the Republican National Committee asked. Perez labor secretary under President Obama will lead a study group called âGovernance and Leadership in Challenging Times.â Brown declined to comment Saturday on whether Perez is being paid for the one-year appointment and how often he must appear on campus. \\"Beyond position titles and dates of service we are not at liberty to disclose deails related to personnel \\" a Brown spokesman said. The announcement also comes a few weeks after the DNC posted its worst July fundraising numbers in a decade raising questions about why the party machine cannot capitalize on President Trumpâs low approval ratings and whether Perez is up to the task. The DNC raised 3.8 million in July compared to 10.2 million for the Republican National Committee. The tally fit a pattern for the Democrats who have posted a string of depressed fundraising numbers month after month this year even after Perez took charge in February. Perez after the small July haul was announced attributed the disappointing results to understaffing and too few fundraisers as he tries to rebuild the group in the wake of 2016's damaging controversies. Many Democrats seem willing to extend Perez a longer honeymoon considering the situation he inherited. The divide was clearly on display earlier this year during the DNCâs so-called Unity Tour in which Perez and Ellison appeared on stage amid questions about whether the party should back pro-life candidates.","completion":"To determine if the given sentiment towards Tom Perez is Neutral, let's break down the document into parts containing positive, negative, and neutral statements about Tom Perez: Positive: 1. Tom Perez was labor secretary under President Obama. Negative: 1. Tom Perez took a part-time teaching gig after saying the DNC chairmanship should be a full-time job. 2. The Republican National Committee criticized Tom Perez for taking a side gig while the DNC struggles. 3. The DNC had the worst July fundraising numbers in a decade, raising questions about Perez's performance. Neutral: 1.

Perez will lead a study group called “Governance and Leadership in Challenging Times” at Brown University. 3.

Question: Question: \\"Which grandfather of an heir to the throne of Sicily was an Emperor of Germany whose reign ended the period of instability that began with the death of a previous emperor in 1125?\\" Context: \\"During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The grandfather of an heir to the throne of Sicily, who was also an Emperor of Germany and whose reign ended the period of instability that began with the death of a previous emperor in 1125, is Frederick I Barbarossa. He was a member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty and his reign as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Germany) extended from 1155 to 1190, during which he stabilized the empire after a period of disarray caused by the death of Emperor Henry V without any heirs. Frederick I Barbarossa was born in 1122 and became the Duke of Swabia in 1147 before being elected as the Holy Roman Emperor in 1155. He was a skilled military commander and renowned statesman, serving as a unifying figure in Germany during a time when the realm was plagued with tensions between various powerful dukes. His reign contributed to the restoration of imperial authority, which had been severely weakened during the period of instability following Emperor Henry V's death. One of Barbarossa's significant accomplishments lies in his efforts to bring about a balance of power by curbing the influence of the territorial dukes and strengthening the ties within the empire. He achieved this by reclaiming royal estates and imperial rights that had been lost during the earlier chaotic period, thus augmenting his power and central authority substantially. As part of his strategic objectives, Frederick I Barbarossa engaged in a number of military campaigns, most notably in Italy, to reassert imperial authority over the rebellious region. He participated in a series of wars against the Lombard League, an alliance formed by several Italian cities that opposed his rule. Significantly, he was also a leading figure in the crusade movement and undertook the Third Crusade in 1189, which, however, ended unsuccessfully with his unexpected death in 1190. As stated in the context, Frederick I Barbarossa was the grandfather of Frederick II, who ruled as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire from 1220 to 1250, in addition to being the heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother. His reign witnessed numerous conflicts with the papacy, often resulting in accusations of heresy leveled against him. In conclusion, Frederick I Barbarossa, a member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, was the grandfather of an heir to the throne of Sicily. His tenure as the Emperor of Germany, spanning from 1155 to 1190, is credited for ending the period of instability that had gripped the empire since the passing of Emperor Henry V in 1125. By successfully restoring order and reestablishing imperial authority, Barbarossa laid the groundwork for his successors to build upon the relative stability that subsequently marked the empire during the 13th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It peaked at #45 on the Billboard album chart. Context_3 : Samuel Manetoali (born January 24, 1969) is a member of the National Parliament of the Solomon Islands. He represents the Gao/Bugotu constituency in Isabel Province. He attended Lepi Primary School and then went on to do his secondary education at the prestigious King George Sixth National School in Honiara. He attended law school at the University of Papua New Guinea and graduated with an LLB degree and further unspecified qualifications from the University of Tasmania and University of South Australia. Prior to entering politics he worked in the country's Public Solicitors Office, then he worked as a private lawyer and a legal adviser to the Isabel Provincial Government. He first entered parliament in the 2006 general election and re-elected in the 2010 general election.. He served as the Solomon Islands' Minister of Police, National Security and Correctional Services in Prime Minister Derek Sikua's Cabinet until May 2009, when he was transferred to the position of Minister for Lands, Survey, and Housing. Following the 2010 general election, he remained in Cabinet, under new Prime Minister Danny Philip, as Minister for Tourism and Culture. In this year's (2014) general election which was held on the 19th November, he was voted in again for the third term with a landslide victory. . He contested as an independent candidate in last week's election.. As a lawyer, many people had expected more from him seeing that many world leaders including Barack Obama and Tony Abott are lawyers by profession and he appears to be a potential candidate for the prime minister's post given his experience as a politician (3 terms including the current term) and his noble profession. His current success in the recent election could be attributed to projects such as mini-fisheries projects that he established in the various villages in his constituency. He also helped the villages and communities by giving handouts such as roofing irons, outboard motor engines, fiber boats, solar panels, cash money and other form of support as a way to maintain and broaden his support. He also supported local tourism in his constituency by giving financial help to tourism operators such as on Sigana Island,albeit, tourism is still at its infant stage in his constituency. His other elixir to maintain his popularity and support is through facilitating and sending Bamboo Bands/groups notably the Hageulu bamboo band overseas for the promotion of tourism and culture for the country and he managed to do that in his capacity as the minister of Tourism and Culture in the Lilo-led government. He was also instrumental in establishing the Gao-Bugotu Cultural Festival initially held in Huali Village in Gao and in Sepi/Lepi Villages in Bugotu.

Context_5 : The Lake Washington ferries in King County, Washington provided the only efficient means for transporting goods and passengers across the lake prior to the opening of the first floating bridge in 1940. The ferries ran between Kirkland, Bellevue, and Houghton across Lake Washington to East Madison Street in Seattle's Madison Park for ten cents each way. They soon became so popular that the King County Port Commission established a public ferry in 1900, competing with private boats. In 1913 a reconfigured side-wheeler steamboat, the wooden \\"Leschi\\", became the first Seattle-built automobile ferry. By 1922 the county ferry system was in such financial difficulty that it appointed its largest competitor to run the system. The 1940 opening of the Lake Washington floating bridge was the beginning of the end for the lake ferries. However, during World War II the ferries carried workers to the Lake Washington Shipyard, where auxiliary ships were built for the U.S. Navy, and made a tidy profit. A year after the tolls were removed from the floating bridge, the last ferry route was retired, and the boat was sold to the Washington State Ferries, which had taken over the Puget Sound Navigation Company in 1951. Context_6 : Monterey Boats, Williston, FL - founded 1985 in Archer Florida by the Marshall brothers, partners, co-chairmen and CEO of the company. From early beginnings with only two 19 foot runabout models Monterey took its first leap in 1989 introducing their first family cruiser. By the mid-1990s Monterey offered a complete line of Sport Boats and Express Cruisers. Today, Monterey Boats builds Sport Boats, Deck Boats, Cruisers and Sport Yachts from 18 to 41 feet. Recent years have seen Monterey Boats grow at a rapid rate, and today the company produces over 2,000 boats per year. Well regarded for its contemporary styling and above-average construction, Monterey has a reputation for customer satisfaction with the strongest warranty in the industry. Context_7 : La Merced is a barrio or a neighborhood of Mexico City defined by its socioeconomics and history rather than by an official designation. It extends over the southeast of the historic center of Mexico City and is one of the oldest sections of the city, established over 700 years ago by the Mexica as part of the founding of Tenochtitlan. Over its history the area was associated with commerce, first as a major docking area for boats bringing goods to Tenochtitlan/Mexico City on Lake Texcoco, later via canals as the lake was slowly drained. In the latter 19th century, the La Merced market was established in the area replacing the massive La Merced monastery which was almost completely destroyed in the 1860s. This market was established to centralize the marketing of foodstuffs for the city on one area. The first La Merced market was built in 1890 and then replaced by the current building in 1957, one of the largest traditional Mexican markets in Mexico City. In the 1980s, the wholesale function of this market was taken over by the newly constructed Centro de Abasto in the south of the city, with the barrio then going into economic and social decline. Although there have been efforts to revitalize the area and the La Merced market remains important, the area has problems with poverty, population loss and prostitution. Context_8 : Kite fishing is a fishing technique involving a kite from which hangs a drop line attached to a lure or bait. The kite is flown out over the surface of a body of water, and the bait floats near the waterline until taken by a fish. The kite then drops immediately, signaling to the fisherman that the bait has been taken, and the fish is then hauled in. Kites can provide the boatless fishermen access to waters that would otherwise be available only to boats. Similarly, for boat owners, kites provide a way to fish in areas where it is not safe to navigate such as shallows or coral reefs where fish may be plentiful. Context_9 : Operation Nordlicht (\\"Northern Light\\") was a German operation during the end of World War II. After Finland had made peace with the USSR, the Germans planned to fall back to defense lines built and equipped in advance across Finnish Lapland (Operation Birke). During the operation, the \\"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\\" gave an order to move from Operation Birke to Operation Nordlicht on 4 October 1944. This meant that instead of evacuating everything and then fortifying on the strong defensive positions German 20th Mountain Army was to retreat according to a set timetable to a new defense line in Lyngen, Norway. The Germans retreated using scorched earth tactics, and destroyed almost all buildings and all boats in Finnmark, thus denying the enemy any facilities in the area. These same tactics had already been used in Finnish Lapland. The retreat ended on January 30, 1945. A detailed account of 'the Nazis' scorched earth campaign in Norway' by Vincent Hunt includes statements by eyewitnesses, photographs taken at the time and a map of locations and prisoner of war camps. Context_10 : Pennsylvania Canal \\"(or sometimes Pennsylvania Canal system)\\" refers generally to a complex system of transportation infrastructure improvements including canals, dams, locks, tow paths, aqueducts, and viaducts. The Canal and Works were constructed and assembled over several decades beginning in 1824, the year of the first enabling act and budget items. It should be understood the \\"first use of any railway\\" in North America was the year 1826, so the newspapers and the Pennsylvania Assembly of 1824 applied the term then to the proposed Right of ways mainly for the canals of the Main Line of Public Works to be built across the southern part of Pennsylvania. Enacted before Railroads gestated during their infancy, the focus of the act was to create through building a canal system, the capability to ship heavy or bulk goods and connect Philadelphia to Pittsburgh—and \\"more importantly\\"—and \\"beyond\\" to the \\"new growth markets\\" in the developing territories reached by the Ohio River now called the midwest. Later, when updated in 1837 to reflect the experience of twelve years of toddler-railways, the term was also applied to railroads and new canals to be added to the state transportation system. As a crowning achievement, the Main Line of Public Works and the Pennsylvania Canal system topped 2100 ft in elevation by erecting the Allegheny Portage Railroad, which used a system of five inclines and five planes on each side of the Eastern Continental Divide at Cresson Pass in Cambria County to actually haul wheeled flat cars, which had halved canal boats placed on them, up and over the Allegheny Front and connect Pittsburgh to the Susquehanna. When finished in 1834 the trip from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh could be made in 3–5 days, weather conditions depending. fact_1 : The title is taken from a line in the novel \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F.

The best thing you can do to improve your grades is focus and pay attention when the information is first presented to you. It's easy to lose focus when your teacher is going on and on about something that's not interesting, but you should not tune them out. Really listen to what they're saying and keep yourself engaged by asking questions and taking notes. . It might seem silly, but notes are actually a great way to help you improve your grades. Good notes are like a road map, when you go to study later on. They'll also show your teachers that you're serious about doing better in your classes. You don't have to write down everything your teacher says: just get down the basics. You know when you tell your parents about what happened to you during the day? That's how you should take notes. Just get the broad strokes, with the really important things written with greater detail. If you know something is confusing to you or seems really complex, write that down too! Even if you don't understand what your teacher is saying, you'll have a note to yourself that you need to look that up and get more information later. Write out your notes by hand, instead of on a computer. You will have an easier time remembering them this way. When you don't understand a concept or fact that your teachers talks about in lecture or that you encounter in your text books, don't be afraid to ask! Smart people don't just know everything instantly...they're curious enough to ask and find out when they don't know something. If you're nervous about asking in front of everyone else, you can also talk to your teacher outside of class time and ask about getting some extra help or explanation. You also shouldn't feel like your teacher would be angry about you not understanding. Teachers are happy when you're interested enough and invested enough to ask for help. If your teacher doesn't explain it in a way that you can understand or if you still feel uncomfortable, try going on the Internet to find a new explanation. You can often find YouTube videos covering common school concepts, and there are also forums and other websites that might deal with your question and explain it to you better. Your teacher will probably give you a syllabus at the beginning of the year or semester. This is a written outline of all of the subjects you will study over the course of the year. You should go over this syllabus carefully and ask your teacher about anything on it that doesn't make sense. Paired with your notes, it's another great road map to your learning. You might not realize it, but your problems concentrating might be because you're hungry! Try eating a small snack between classes, as well as a drink of water, in order to help your brain concentrate and have the best chance at absorbing the material. Your snack should be high in protein, which will give you the most energy. Try salami sticks or a handful of almonds or soy nuts. Everyone learns in different ways. Some people learn better when they're moving and using their body. Some people learn better with lots of pictures and visuals. Some people learn better when they can hear things like words and music. Think about what helps you remember things the most and then find ways to work that into how you learn your course material. For example, if you're an auditory learner (someone who learns better with sounds), ask your teacher if you can record lectures to listen to again later. If you don't know your learning style, you can take a test here or you can take any number of other online tests. You can also just analyze your own classroom experiences. If you're a visual learner, draw up some charts or webs which visually represent the information you need to learn and how the ideas are connected.","completion":"To improve your grades, actively listen and take handwritten notes during class, ask questions, utilize your teacher and resources such as the syllabus, maintain focus through proper nutrition, and adapt study methods to your learning style."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Eddie James \\"Son\\" House, Jr. (March 21, 1902 - October 19, 1988) was an American delta blues singer and guitarist, noted for his highly emotional style of singing and slide guitar playing. After years of hostility to secular music, as a preacher and for a few years also as a church pastor, he turned to blues performance at the age of 25. He quickly developed a unique style by applying the rhythmic drive, vocal power and emotional intensity of his preaching to the newly learned idiom. In a short career interrupted by a spell in Parchman Farm penitentiary, he developed to the point that Charley Patton, the foremost blues artist of the Mississippi Delta region, invited him to share engagements and to accompany him to a 1930 recording session for Paramount Records. In 1927, at the age of 25, House underwent a change of musical perspective as rapid and dramatic as a religious conversion. In a hamlet south of Clarksdale, he heard one of his drinking companions, either James McCoy or Willie Wilson (his recollections differed), playing bottleneck guitar, a style he had never heard before. He immediately changed his attitude about the blues, bought a guitar from a musician called Frank Hoskins, and within weeks was playing with Hoskins, McCoy and Wilson. Two songs he learned from McCoy would later be among his best known: \\"My Black Mama\\" and \\"Preachin' the Blues\\". Another source of inspiration was Rube Lacey, a much better known performer who had recorded for Columbia Records in 1927 (no titles were released) and for Paramount Records in 1928 (two titles were released). In an astonishingly short time, with only these four musicians as models, House developed to a professional standard a blues style based on his religious singing and simple bottleneck guitar style. Around 1927 or 1928, he had been playing in a juke joint when a man went on a shooting spree, wounding House in the leg, and he allegedly shot the man dead. House received a 15-year sentence at the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman Farm), of which he served two years between 1928 and 1929. He credited his re-examination and release to an appeal by his family, but also spoke of the intervention by the influential white planter for whom they worked. The date of the killing and the duration of his sentence are unclear; House gave different accounts to different interviewers, and searches by his biographer Daniel Beaumont found no details in the court records of Coahoma County or in the archive of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Upon his release in 1929 or early 1930, House was strongly advised to leave Clarksdale and stay away. He walked to Jonestown and caught a train to the small town of Lula, Mississippi, sixteen miles north of Clarksdale and eight miles from the blues hub of Helena, Arkansas. Coincidentally, the great star of Delta blues, Charley Patton, was also in virtual exile in Lula, having been expelled from his base on the Dockery Plantation. With his partner Willie Brown, Patton dominated the local market for professional blues performance. Patton watched House busking when he arrived penniless at Lula station, but did not approach him. He observed House's showmanship attracting a crowd to the cafe and bootleg whiskey business of a woman called Sara Knight. Patton invited House to be a regular musical partner with him and Brown. House formed a liaison with Knight, and both musicians profited from association with her bootlegging activities. The musical partnership is disputed by Patton's biographers Stephen Calt and Gayle Dean Wardlow. They consider that House's musicianship was too limited to play with Patton and Brown, who were also rumoured to be estranged at the time. They also cite one statement by House that he did not play for dances in Lula. Beaumont concluded that House became a friend of Patton's, traveling with him to gigs but playing separately.","completion":"This text is about Eddie James \\"Son\\" House, Jr., an American delta blues singer and guitarist.

Example of a negative review: Topic: Bluetooth Headphones Review: Title: Disappointing audio quality and poor battery life I recently purchased the XYZ Bluetooth Headphones, and I was quite excited about their sleek design and seemingly impressive specifications. Unfortunately, my experience using these headphones has been overwhelmingly negative. The most glaring issue is the audio quality. Despite the manufacturer claiming to have premium sound quality, the music playback is muddled and lacks clarity, making it difficult to enjoy my favorite songs. In addition to the poor audio, the battery life is significantly shorter than advertised. The headphones barely last 4 hours on a full charge, rather than the promised 8 hours. Furthermore, the headphones repeatedly disconnect from my device, forcing me to go through the pairing process multiple times a day. I also find them to be uncomfortable to wear for extended periods, which only adds to the disappointment. It would be great if the manufacturer could improve their product by delivering on their audio quality claims, improving battery life, and ensuring a stable connection. In conclusion, I cannot recommend the XYZ Bluetooth Headphones, as they have proven to be a frustrating and disappointing investment. I would give them a 2 out of 5 rating."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Normally and naturally, a daughter is more attached to her mother in comparison to her father or other siblings . The attachment is also due to the fact that the daughter finds it easier to believe in the mother on personal and biological matters at different stages while growing up. The bonding between mother and daughter will increase with their being together and going out on excursions. An excursion is a journey to some far-off place undertaken by people. It is not necessary that such a trip be taken on a lavish scale involving lots of money. It can be as short as an overnight trip to some place to improve bonding. To surprise her daughter with an unexpected excursion, mother can plan a trip to some local spa without the knowledge of her daughter. She can be ready with baggage packed and wait for the moment the daughter comes back from school. Once in the hotel they can enjoy the night together getting refreshing treatments like massage or mud packs. After relaxing spa they can laze in bed, enjoying favourite food or drink and if possible enjoying nature through the window. After a long period of relaxation, going out for a walk together will improve bonding. Going out overnight to enjoy walk at the beach, and relaxing at intervals without the interference of any other person can be a great idea of bonding. Being of the same sex, and often having the same set of likes and dislikes, they can spend time on makeup or applying nail polish. The daughter should never forget to thank the mother for the wonderful time they spent together, and the mother should never hesitate to say a few words of praise to the daughter. Going out for shopping together is a good bonding idea too. It is not essential that lots of money should be spent on shopping. The mother can take the daughter to some shops where she can buy her uniform or some other things. They can jointly enjoy window shopping, expressing love and gratitude for the other.","completion":"Question: According to the article, which of the following activities is suggested to improve the bonding between a mother and daughter?

For conspiracy theorists, it had been yet more proof of the existence of a sinister Government agency tracking their every move. But now a claim that hackers had managed to penetrate a top secret dossier used by FBI agents to spy on Apple users appears to have been proven unfounded. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had been the centre of a major privacy row after cyber experts from The AntiSec hacking group released more than a million Apple device IDs - allegedly taken from an agent's laptop. Hackers claimed to have obtained more than 12 million ID codes Apple uses to identify its gadgets from an FBI agent's laptop. The group claimed the information - which included 12 million IDs, known as Unique Device Identifiers, as well as personal information such as user names,. device names, notification tokens, cell phone numbers and addresses - enabled the Government to spy on the users. The FBI immediately denied it was the source - but many refused to believe it was anything other than affirmation of their Orwellian nightmares. However, a boss of a small publishing. agency has come forward to say his firm was the most likely source of. the information - not a murky, malign Government agency. Paul DeHart, CEO of the Blue Toad,. which provides app building services to 6,000 users and serves. 100million page views a month, told NBC News technicians had matched. the hacked information with their own private data. He said: 'That's 100 percent confidence level, it's our data.' He added: 'As soon as we found out we. were involved and victimised, we approached the appropriate law. enforcement officials, and we began to take steps to come forward, clear. the record and take responsibility for this.' AntiSec last week released a million of unique IDs online - but removed the most personal data. The hackers issued a statement saying: 'During the second week of March 2012, a Dell Vostro notebook, used by Supervisor Special Agent Christopher K. Stangl from FBI Regional Cyber Action Team and New York FBI Office Evidence Response Team was breached using the AtomicReferenceArray vulnerability on Java. The move comes as Apple is believed to be putting the finishing touches to a launch event for a new version of its iPhone. 'During the shell session some files. were downloaded from his Desktop folder one of them with the name of. ”NCFTA_iOS_devices_intel.csv” turned to be a list of 12,367,232 Apple. iOS devices including Unique Device Identifiers (UDID), user names, name. of device, type of device, Apple Push Notification Service tokens,. zipcodes, cellphone numbers, addresses, etc. 'The personal details fields referring to people appears many times empty leaving the whole list incompleted on many parts. 'No other file on the same folder makes mention about this list or its purpose. It had been thought the group published the numbers to prove the existence of a unit in the FBI which was track people via their computer identification data. The Antisec group has made the files freely available online. 'There you have 1,000,001 Apple Devices UDIDs linking to their users and their APNS tokens,' it said. 'The original file contained around 12,000,000 devices. we decided a million would be enough to release. 'We trimmed out other personal data as, full names, cell numbers, addresses, zipcodes, etc. 'Not all devices have the same amount of personal data linked, some devices contained lot of info, others no more than zipcodes or almost anything. 'We left those main columns we consider enough to help a significant amount of users to look if their devices are listed there or not. the DevTokens are included for those mobile hackers who could figure out some use from the dataset.' The group also defended its decision to release the data. 'well we have learnt it seems quite clear nobody pays attention if you just come and say 'hey, FBI is using your device details and info.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. We have: 224 = -1088*j + 1056*j First, notice that both terms on the right side of the equation have a \\"j\\" in them. We can combine them by adding them together. -1088*j means we have -1088 j's, and 1056*j means we have 1056 j's. If we add both amounts together, we will end up with: (-1088 + 1056) * j Doing the math inside the parentheses, we find: -1088 + 1056 = -32 So, now our equation looks like: 224 = -32 * j Now, we need to find out what number \\"j\\" is. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -32 to isolate \\"j\\" on one side. 224 / -32 = (-32 * j) / -32 Calculating both sides, we get: -7 = j So, the answer is: j = -7 There you go!

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Warm or hot water can be very helpful for relieving many symptoms of sickness. It can loosen mucus in the nose, clear the head, relieve congestion and soothe tense muscles. Your bath or shower water should be between 36 and 40°C (or 95 to 105°F) to minimize the risk of burning your skin. Check the temperature with a thermometer or simply adjust the temperature on your water heater. Breathe in the steam from the water. Add Epsom salts or an aromatherapy oil such as eucalyptus or peppermint to the water. Either product can have a sedative effect and also open up stuffed nasal passages and your head. Consider keeping a humidifier near you to help keep your head clear of congestion throughout the day. Rinsing your throat with saltwater can relieve a sore and scratchy throat. This remedy can relieve inflammation and may make it easier to swallow and talk. Mix 1/2 a teaspoon of salt into an 8-oz glass of warm water to make saltwater. Rinse with a mouthful of the solution for 30 seconds. You can do this as often as necessary. You may not have any choice but to go to work or school, or even just stay home. Reducing your workload by eliminating strenuous tasks can help you get much needed rest as well as relieving symptoms such as pain and discomfort. Take it easy wherever you can. For example, try and reschedule meetings or don’t participate in gym class. If you work at home, leave strenuous work such as the laundry or cleaning until you feel better. Decreasing and shifting your workload can be especially important if you are taking medications that make you foggy or drowsy. Stay away from exercise until you feel better. This may give you enough energy to get through the day. If you are feeling too sick to get through your day, call in sick to work or school. This may help you feel better more quickly while minimizing the risk that you spread any illness to colleagues. Be honest with your superiors about why you are not coming. For example, “I’m suffering from terrible congestion and a very bad headache. It makes it difficult to concentrate.” This is a good option if you work at a job such as construction where you cannot do less strenuous activity until you feel better. If you work with children, the elderly, or people with weakened or compromised immune systems, or if you work with food, you absolutely should not go to work when sick. Ensuring that you are properly hydrated can replace fluids you lose as a result of being sick. This may help relieve your symptoms so that you feel well enough to push through the day. Drink at least nine cups of water for proper hydration if you are a woman and 13 cups if you are a man. Drink clear liquids such as water, juice, clear broth, or non-caffeinated soft drinks. Steer clear of caffeinated beverages such as coffee, black teas, and soft drinks. They could dehydrate you and exacerbate your symptoms. Several studies have shown eating chicken soup can relieve the symptoms of a cold or other illness. Having some chicken soup can help keep you hydrated as well as minimizing your symptoms. There are many options for chicken soups including tasty chicken noodle soup. Chicken soup possesses anti-inflammatory properties. It can also help increase the movement of mucus through the nose, which can alleviate congestion and other symptoms. The BRAT diet, which stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast is low in fiber and easy to digest. It can help ease an upset stomach and replace nutrients. You can also eat crackers, boiled potatoes, and gelatin to help soothe an upset stomach. Add more complex foods such as cereal, fruits, and vegetables once you are able to keep down BRAT foods and chicken soup. Be gentle on your stomach, especially if you’re nauseous, vomiting, or have diarrhea. Dairy, fatty or fried foods, or spicy dishes may exacerbate your symptoms. Alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco products can exacerbate the symptoms of a cold. Avoiding these products while you are sick may make you feel better and reduce the duration of your symptoms. Ensuring that you’re getting sufficient rest is an important part of feeling well enough to get through your day. You can take naps or even just sit quietly to give your body rest. Take naps during the day and get at least 8 hours of sleep a night. Both an make it much easier to get through the day if you’re sick. Sleep in a space that is comfortable, warm, and slightly humid. Use a vaporizer or cool-mist humidifier keep the air moist and help alleviate congestion and coughing. Allow a fan to circulate air. You can also open a window if it is not cold outside. If your symptoms persist and resting doesn’t make you able to function through the day, schedule an appointment with the doctor. She can treat your symptoms and may give you medication that can help you function enough to make it through any day.","completion":"Hot water can help in relieving symptoms of sickness and should be used at a safe temperature of 36-40°C (95-105°F).

For sore and scratchy throats, a saltwater rinse can be beneficial. Reducing and delegating strenuous tasks can help in managing discomfort and rest can alleviate symptoms, especially if medication is causing drowsiness. If the illness is severe, it's advisable to take time off, especially if it might result in spreading the disease in vulnerable environments like schools or food establishments.

He became a friend of many who were active in the world of the arts in Paris, including Franz Liszt (who had been based there since 1827), George Sand, and Victor Hugo. It is not clear exactly when he first met Frédéric Chopin, who arrived in Paris in September 1831. In 1832 Alkan took the solo role in his first Concerto da camera for piano and strings at the Conservatoire. In the same year, aged 19, he was elected to the influential Société Académique des Enfants d'Apollon (Society of the Children of Apollo), whose members included Luigi Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, the conductor François Habeneck, and Liszt, who had been elected in 1824 at the age of twelve. Between 1833 and 1836 Alkan participated at many of the Society's concerts. Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, in 1832 and again in 1834; the cantatas which he wrote for the competition, Hermann et Ketty and L'Entrée en loge, have remained unpublished and unperformed.In 1834 Alkan began his friendship with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in 2009. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will, or became lost after his death. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second Concerto da camera was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field; it was published in London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835.

The hypothesis, \\"It's not easy to show when people commit fraud,\\" is fundamentally a reiteration of the premise. It maintains the same idea that proving fraud is difficult. The hypothesis emphasizes the challenge of demonstrating when a person commits the criminal act. This difficulty may stem from the same factors mentioned earlier, indicating that the underlying reasons for why proving fraud is difficult have not changed. In essence, the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise, upholding the notion of fraud being challenging to prove. Both the premise and the hypothesis focus on the difficulties faced when attempting to demonstrate the occurrence of fraud and the individuals involved. Therefore, if the premise is true, it can be reasonably concluded that the hypothesis is true as well. The relationship between the two statements appears to be logically consistent, supporting the validity of this conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof.

Answer:","completion":"The Japanese boat \\"Tomozuru\\" participated in the conquest known as the \\"Southern Operation\\" from 1941 to 1942. The Southern Operation was a series of campaigns by the Empire of Japan to expand its territories across Southeast Asia and the Pacific during World War II. The \\"Tomozuru\\" was a Tomozuru-class torpedo boat, commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1938. As part of the Empire's 11th Torpedo Boat Division, the \\"Tomozuru\\" was assigned to support Japan's military operations in the region. The Southern Operation encompassed several key sub-campaigns during the larger Pacific campaign of World War II, including: 1. The invasion of the Philippines: Starting in December 1941, the Japanese forces invaded the Philippines, a strategic United States territory in the Pacific. Japan's successful capture of the Philippines weakened the US's foothold in the region, ultimately leading to the forced surrender of Filipino and American forces in May 1942. 2. The invasion of Malaya and Singapore: Concurrently with the Philippines invasion, Japanese forces also launched a successful campaign against British Malaya and Singapore, beginning in December 1941. The fall of Singapore in February 1942 was a severe blow to British imperial prestige in the region. 3. The Dutch East Indies Campaign: Japan targeted the resource-rich Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) to secure vital resources such as oil, rubber, and tin, which were crucial for its wartime efforts. In January 1942, Japanese forces began their invasion, encountering Allied resistance primarily from Dutch, British, Australian, and American forces. By March 1942, Japan had successfully captured the Dutch East Indies. 4. The Battle of Burma: In early 1942, Japanese forces launched an invasion of Burma (present-day Myanmar), with the intent of severing supply lines between British India and China. Japan successfully occupied Burma throughout the war until 1945, when it was finally recaptured by British and Indian forces. 5. The battles in the Pacific and Indian Oceans: During this time period, Japan also sought to expand its naval dominance across the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Key engagements included the Battle of the Java Sea in February 1942, the Doolittle Raid in April 1942, and the Indian Ocean Raid. Throughout the Southern Operation, the \\"Tomozuru\\" played a supporting role, particularly in the maritime engagements across the region. As a torpedo boat, it was tasked with patrolling, providing support for major combat vessels, and conducting small-scale raids against enemy ships. The Southern Operation's initial success enabled Japan to establish a vast empire across Southeast Asia and the Pacific by mid-1942. However, this rapid expansion drew the United States further into the conflict, ultimately leading to Japan's eventual defeat in World War II."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989.

Britain's richest 1% own as much as poorest 55% of population Houses along Kensington Palace Gardens in London, Britain's most expensive street. Oxfam recently reported that five billionaire families controlled the same wealth as 20% of the population. Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images Britain's richest 1% have accumulated as much wealth as the poorest 55% of the population put together, according to the latest official analysis of who owns the nation's £9.5tn of property, pensions and financial assets. In figures that also lay bare the extent of inequality across the north-south divide, the Office for National Statistics said household wealth in the south-east had been rising five times as fast as across the whole country. The average wealth of households in the southeast had surged to £309,000 at the end of 2012, up 30% since the first wealth report published by the ONS covering 2006-8 – while the average rise in England was only 6%. But wealth in the north-east had fallen, the only region where it did so, to an average of just under £143,000. In Scotland the figure was £165,500. The data also shows that one in nine households have second homes or rental properties and one in 14 sport a personalised number plate on their car. Northern regions lost out after a dramatic rise in stock market values that was grabbed mostly by households in the south east, the ONS figures show. The situation is likely to have worsened following an 18% surge in house prices over the past year in the south-east and even higher at the top end of the market. A rush to save among richer households as the recession deepened boosted the nation's total wealth and ensured Britain's long-established financial inequality remained in place, with the top 10% laying claim to 44% of household wealth – while the poorest half of the country had only 9%. Rachael Orr, Oxfam's head of poverty in the UK said the figures were a \\"shocking chapter in a tale of two Britains\\". The charity recently reported that five billionaire families controlled the same wealth as 20% of the population. \\"It is further evidence of increasing inequality at a time when five rich families have the same wealth as 12 million people,\\" she said. \\"We need our politicians to grasp the nettle and make the narrowing gap between the richest and poorest a top priority. It cannot be right that in Britain today a small elite are getting richer and richer while millions are struggling to make ends meet.\\" Duncan Exley, director of the Equality Trust, said: \\"The grotesque concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny minority is fracturing our society, weakening our economy and giving disproportionate power to the richest. Unless policymakers adopt a clear goal of reducing the gap between the richest and the rest, they will have to govern an increasingly dysfunctional nation.\\"The report comes after French economist Thomas Piketty has ignited international debate about inequality by documenting the rapid accumulation of assets by the top 1% over the four decades since the 1970s. Britain's top 1% saw their share of wealth increase slightly in the four years before 2012, grabbing the same share as 54.9% of the population, up from 54.2% in 2008/10. But the Treasury said the report showed that wealth inequality had remained the same throughout the six years up to 2012 while income inequality had declined to levels last seen in 1986. A spokesperson said the government's efforts to protect the poorest during the recession had worked. \\"The effects of the Great Recession are still being felt which is why we have taken continued action to help hardworking people by cutting income tax and freezing fuel duty. \\"And we want to help more people to save for their future or own their own home which is why we are giving people more flexibility over their pensions and introducing Help to Buy. At the same time we have introduced new higher rates of stamp duty on the most expensive homes and done more than any previous government to crack down on tax evasion and avoidance in order to ensure that everyone pays their fair share in tax.\\" Critics of the wealth report said it failed to capture the huge diversion of wealth to offshore tax havens, which account for trillions of pounds worth of savings. A series of investigations into offshore tax havens have documented the success of their banks in attracting a steady rise in the savings and financial assets of the richest 1%. There was also a clear disparity between women and men over who owns the most homes, pensions, cars and stocks and shares. The average value of men's total pension wealth was nearly twice as high as women's in 2010/12 – £63,000 compared with £34,800. The power of the grey pound is highlighted in the report by several measures, including one showing that couples without children, where one person is over and the other under the state pension age, have the highest total wealth at £607,800, up from £452,000 in 2006.

Options: - broken spirit - healthy body - broken bones - cold nose - broken legs Explain why a human would choose \\"broken bones\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"broken bones\\" as the answer to the question above due to several reasons that are closely related to the context provided and the human ability to anticipate, empathize, and learn from experiences. Firstly, we are informed that the person was scared of skiing after the accident. This implies that the individual experienced a traumatic event, which led to a negative emotional response. The fact that the person became scared after the accident suggests that the accident resulted in serious consequences, likely involving physical harm or pain. Thus, \\"broken bones\\" is a logical answer because it is associated with severe injury and pain, which would be something a person would want to avoid after experiencing such an event. Another reason why a human would choose \\"broken bones\\" over the other options is that it directly relates to the consequences of a skiing accident, potentially in which limbs and joints are subjected to extreme forces and impact. Skiing accidents carry a higher risk of broken bones due to the intensity and speed of the sport. Hence, it is a reasonable choice out of the available options considering the context of the question. Furthermore, humans are capable of understanding and empathizing with the pain and fear associated with broken bones. From an early age, we learn that injuries like broken bones can take time to heal and may require invasive medical procedures or a long recovery process. This knowledge can evoke a stronger emotional response, leading to a heightened desire to avoid such an outcome. Among the other options: - \\"Broken spirit\\" might seem like a reasonable choice considering the individual became scared after the accident. However, it is a more figurative expression rather than something tangible. In this case, a human would likely choose something more closely related to the physical aspect of the accident. - \\"Healthy body\\" contradicts the situation described, as a person avoiding skiing seeks to avoid harm and potential injury rather than maintaining a healthy body. - \\"Cold nose\\" is a minor discomfort, not indicating significant harm, compared to more severe consequences like broken bones, making it less practical to answer the question. - \\"Broken legs\\" might be considered as a potential answer, but \\"broken bones\\" is a more inclusive option, encompassing all possible bone fractures, including the legs. Therefore, a human would likely choose the more general answer. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"broken bones\\" as the answer since it represents a tangible and direct consequence of a skiing accident, takes into account the fear and pain associated with such an injury, and generally best explains the situation described in the context. This choice reflects the human ability to relate personal experiences, anticipate negative outcomes, and empathize with or learn from the emotions and pain of others."},{"prompt":"Q:Title: Very disappointed.... Review: I purchased this for my son who was taking a beginning B&W photography class at our local community college. Prior to making the purchase I read reviews from multiple sources and while most had good things to say, quite a few mentioned a faulty/poor light meter system. I made the purchase anyway, hoping to get a good one, but it was not to be.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: US law enforcement authorities are investigating plans by members of the hacking collective Anonymous to disrupt activities at the Marine Corps base in Quantico to protest against the alleged rough treatment given suspected WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning. Anonymous gained wide attention last year with attacks on the websites of PayPal and other businesses that had stopped processing donations to anti-secrecy site WikiLeaks as it published thousands of secret US state department cables. Recently, Anonymous members appear to have broadened their targets by suggesting attacks on the US military. On publicly accessible document-sharing sites, they have been discussing plans to target the brig in Quantico, Virginia, where Private Manning is being held under what his attorney said were unjustifiable conditions. One collaborative document states the “purpose” of the contemplated operation is to “harass staff at MCB Quantico Brig to the point of frustration”. The “plan” is described as a “complete communications shutdown” of the facilities’ internet pages and phone links. A Quantico spokesman, Lieutenant Agustin Solivan, said officials had referred the matter to law enforcement and counter-intelligence agencies. “We are aware of the threat and any threats to defence department information systems and networks are taken seriously,” he said. “The intent or stating that you are going to commit a crime is a crime in itself,” he added. Barrett Brown, who has been helping with the plans under his real name, said he was not alarmed about the prospect of prosecution. “My feeling is I’m going down anyway so I may as well do it with gusto.” Members of Anonymous identify with WikiLeaks and see themselves as crusaders for the free flow of information. But while WikiLeaks has merely published classified material, as have mainstream media organisations, Anonymous has become steadily more aggressive. First it went after businesses with “denial-of-service” attacks, in which computers bombard websites until they can’t handle the load and become unavailable to the public. That brought some 40 law enforcement searches in the US and a handful or arrests in other countries. Anonymous became more brazen last month, hacking into a US security firm that had boasted to the Financial Times of infiltrating the online group and identifying many of its leaders. Anonymous distributed thousands of internal e-mails from the company, HBGary Federal, among other things showing that HBGary Federal and two allied businesses had proposed planting fake documents on WikiLeaks to discredit that site. ||||| A leader of the computer hackers group known as Anonymous is threatening new attacks on major U.S. corporations and government officials as part of at an escalating “cyberwar” against the citadels of American power. “It’s a guerrilla cyberwar — that’s what I call it,” said Barrett Brown, 29, who calls himself a senior strategist and “propagandist” for Anonymous. He added: “It’s sort of an unconventional, asymmetrical act of warfare that we’ve involved in. And we didn’t necessarily start it. I mean, this fire has been burning.” A defiant and cocky 29-year-old college dropout, Brown was cavalier about accusations that the group is violating federal laws. He insisted that Anonymous members are only policing corporate and governmental wrongdoing — as its members define it. Breaking laws, but 'ethically' “Our people break laws, just like all people break laws,” he added. “When we break laws, we do it in the service of civil disobedience. We do so ethically. We do it against targets that have asked for it.” And those targets are apparently only growing in number. Angered over the treatment of Bradley Manning, the Army private who is accused of leaking classified U.S. government documents to WikiLeaks and who is currently being held in solitary confinement at a military brig in Quantico, Va., Brown says the group is planning new computer attacks targeting government officials involved in his case. Read more reporting by Michael Isikoff in 'The Isikoff Files' Among the methods the group is vowing to use: posting personal information about the officials on the Internet, a method known as “doxing.” The group also this week issued a threat over the Internet to “harass” the staff at Quantico “to the point of frustration,” including a “complete communications shutdown” of its Internet and phone links. In recent months, Anonymous — a loose collection of tech-savvy hackers or “hacktivists” — has threatened some of the biggest corporations in the country. The group is also the target of a major FBI investigation that has included dozens of subpoenas and raids on the homes of suspected members. (In the interview, Brown, a sometimes freelance journalist, said he is not personally involved in hacking computers, stressing that he only advises the group, participates in its internal strategy sessions and serves as its spokesman. An FBI spokeswoman on Tuesday described the bureau’s investigation of Anonymous members as “ongoing,” but declined further comment.) Anonymous has been blamed by senior U.S. government officials — including Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn — with mounting so-called “distributed denial of service” (DDoS) attacks on major corporate and government targets. The group is believed to do this by mobilizing thousands of so-called “zombie” computers, which have been infected with viruses, and directing them to flood a targeted website simultaneously, creating such a huge demand for service that the site shuts down. Champion of WikiLeaks, Mideast protesters Anonymous is believed to have used this method in December, when it took credit for crashing the websites of MasterCard and Visa in retaliation for their decision to cut off service to WikiLeaks. It also claimed credit for shutting down government websites in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, which it thereby helping to stoke the uprising in those countries. Last month, the hackers group launched what may have been its most audacious attack to date, aiming its guns on HBGary Federal, a major cybersecurity firm and government contractor. After HBGary Federal’s CEO threatened to expose members of Anonymous, the group struck back — breaking into the cybersecurity firm’s computers, hijacking the CEO’s Twitter account and swiping tens of thousands of embarrassing emails that it later posted on the Internet. Related coverage: Do WikiLeaks imitators put your e-mail at risk? The emails appeared to show that HBGary Federal and two other contractors were proposing a “disinformation campaign” aimed at discrediting political allies of WikiLeaks and critics of the Bank of American and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, prompting a group of House Democrats to call for a congressional investigation into the contractors. Asked about Anonymous, Greg Hoglund, the CEO of HBGary, the founder of HBGary Federal, said Tuesday: “These are not hacktivists. They are criminals. They are breaking into computer systems and stealing information — and that violates multiple federal statutes.” In the first network television interview he has given, Brown – who has been widely quoted as one of the group’s spokesmen — invited NBC to his walk up, one-room Dallas apartment and allowed a reporter to observe as he and what he said were other Anonymous members communicated in a secure chat room. Their goal that day: drafting a threatening letter to PayPal, the online processing firm owned by eBay, in response to news that the firm had restricted service to Manning’s legal defense fund. Threatening PayPal “We politely ask you to finally stand up and show some backbone,” said Brown, reading from the letter on his small laptop. “Unfreeze the account, or release the funds, so Bradley Manning and his lawyers can access it. Otherwise you prove you are nothing but a puppet of a criminal government, which is violating the Geneva Convention and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.” And then, said Brown: “As always, it ends…We are Anonymous. We do not forgive. We do not forget.” “That’s our little motto,” he added. There is still much about Anonymous that remains obscure -- and which Brown would not reveal. As he tells it, the group has thousands, if not tens of thousands, of participants, including, he claims, computer managers at major corporations and government agencies and journalists. But, he says, the group’s activities are governed, or at least shaped, by a much smaller group of a “couple dozen” people that reacts to the “ebb and flow” of events. Their overarching goal, he said, “information freedom.” But there is little doubt that they are capable of brutal actions. Hoglund, the HBGary CEO, said that as part of their attack on his corporate affiliate HBGary Federal, Anonymous members collected personal information on company employees, including Social Security numbers, home addresses and the names of their children. Some employees received death threats, he said. “Anonymous is not what people think,” he added. “They are vicious individuals and they are having the time of their lives because of all the press they are receiving.” No apologies for tough tactics Brown, for his part, makes no bones about the fact that Anonymous plays rough. Asked about the group’s capabilities, he said, “Well, they keep increasing, but I can tell you that our capabilities are such that, we can, for instance, go into the servers of a federal contracting company … take those servers down, delete backups, take all internal emails, take documents, shut down the websites of the owners of those companies, take everything from those websites, ruin the lives of people who have done it wrong … harass them, make sure they’ll never work again in this particular industry. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A group called Anonymous, which is made up of computer hackers, is planning to disrupt a Marine Corps base to protest against the treatment of a man named Bradley Manning.

As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant. We get done, our favorite waitress drops the check, and this goofball says something about “dine and dash.” We all just looked at him like he had grown a penis in the middle of his forehead and was trying to screw anyone within spitting distance with it. This kid wasn't driving, it would be a ten mile walk through neighborhoods that were questionable during the daytime, and he is talking about not just stiffing our favorite waitress on a tip, but walking out without paying? Are you kidding me? “Ryan. If you do that, you will be left beaten and bloody in the parking lot and EVERY ONE of us will participate.” He hanged his head and coughed up his share of the bill, but he still didn't leave a tip. She made over five bucks a head in tips every time we walked in the door. Several of us were servers, bartenders, bouncers, and a couple strippers. Tips were how a lot of us put food on the table, and chemicals in our system. We shared when we had a good night. Needless to say, Ryan never joined us on a run to Denny's again.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — South Korea is looking into developing and financing economic projects with North Korea that could take effect if a nuclear deal is reached with the United States. South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said on Wednesday the government was “internally carrying out preparations” to organize, finance and implement possible inter-Korea projects. But he also emphasized that Seoul would first seek support from the international community for any North Korean development projects, and would only proceed if the U.S. -North Korea summit, expected to be held in late May or June, produces a joint denuclearization agreement. North Korea is under tough sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for its nuclear weapons and missiles tests, including accelerated efforts in the last two years to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could potentially target the U.S. mainland. The international sanctions ban an estimated 90 percent of the country’s external trade. Seeking sanctions relief is considered a key motivating factor in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s diplomatic pivot this year to suspend further provocative missile and nuclear tests, and to engage in talks to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. But easing sanctions would make it more difficult to enforce the North’s denuclearization promises. “Once the sanctions are lifted, North Korea will gain autonomy over its trade, and considering its low labor costs and skilled workforce, I think the North Korean economy would gain power again,” said Shin Beom-chul, the director of Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted he will keep sanctions in place until North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program. South Korea, however, is considering a range of economic incentives to encourage Kim to follow through on a nuclear deal with Trump. But these investments are prohibited by the U.N. sanctions and would require a Security Council exemption to proceed. At the recent...

However, it's important to note that there have been multiple rounds of sanctions imposed on North Korea by the United Nations Security Council, starting in 2006 in response to the country's nuclear weapons and missile tests. Some of the factors contributing to the sanctions include: - North Korea's missile testing - Kim Jong Un's reluctance to dismantle the nuclear arsenal - Provocative acts by North Korea, which exacerbate tensions in the region It is also mentioned that the sanctions have intensified over the last two years, prior to President Trump attending the summit and the recent diplomatic engagements between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Quick and the Dead Movie plot: Duncan McKaskel (Tom Conti) and his wife, Susanna (Kate Capshaw), a married couple who, along with their 12-year-old son, Tom (Kenny Morrison), are travelling West hoping to start a new life. They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss. McKaskel never learns of the kiss, but tells Vallian, who is critical of his apparent pacifism, to back off several times. In an encounter with Indians, Susanna learns that her brother, an army officer, has likely been killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Out hunting, Vallian is shot.

Let's first look at the problem: 166 * o + 264 * o - 6450 = 0 Now, to make it easier, we can combine stuff that is alike. If you have 166 circles and 264 more circles, how many circles do you have? You simply add them together, like this: (166 + 264) * o - 6450 = 0 If we add the numbers, we get 430 circles: 430 * o - 6450 = 0 Now, we want to find how many times we need to multiply these circles to fill up a space of 6450. This means we need to get the circles' value alone, or as we say, \\"solve for o.\\" To do that, we'll add 6450 to both sides of the equation: 430 * o = 6450 Now, to find the value of each circle (or \\"o\\"), we should take the total value (6450) and divide it by the number of circles (430): o = 6450 / 430 If we do the division, we find out that each circle (or \\"o\\") has a value of 15: o = 15 So, the solution to the problem is o = 15.

Answer the question...who won the arms race in the cold war??","completion":"The arms race during the Cold War was a period of intense competition, primarily between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR), along with their respective allies. This race focused on the development, production, and deployment of advanced military technology and weaponry, including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. It lasted roughly from the mid-1940s to the early 1990s, with other minor competing powers such as the United Kingdom, France, and China involved, albeit on a smaller scale. The arms race played a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of the Cold War. Although it is not accurate to declare a clear-cut winner in this competition, as the arms race gradually deescalated without a conventional military confrontation, it is widely accepted that the US and its allies emerged in a stronger position when the Cold War ended. Several factors contributed to this assessment of the US as the more successful party in the arms race: 1. Economic Strength: Throughout the arms race, the US maintained a stronger economy compared to the USSR. The American free-market capitalist system enabled rapid economic growth, technological innovation, and better living standards for its population. On the other hand, the centrally planned economy in the USSR faced chronic inefficiencies, reduced incentives for innovation, and limited consumer goods. As a result, the US was able to sustain its military spending and development without severely compromising its citizens' well-being, while the burden of the arms race on the USSR ultimately contributed to its economic weakness. 2. Technological Advantages: The US generally maintained an edge in technological innovations during the arms race. It was the first country to develop nuclear weapons, as demonstrated by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The US kept advancing its atomic weapons arsenal and eventually developed the more potent hydrogen bomb. Also, significant advances in areas like missile systems, surveillance, stealth technology, and computing capabilities gave the US a competitive advantage over the Soviet military-industrial complex. 3. Strategic Initiatives: Throughout the Cold War, the US and NATO successfully implemented various strategic initiatives aimed at undermining the USSR's efforts in the arms race. The strategy of containment sought to limit the expansion of communism globally, thereby restricting Soviet influence and military presence. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan launched the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a missile defense system designed to protect the US from potential Soviet nuclear attacks. While never fully implemented, SDI forced the Soviet Union to increase its military spending, exacerbating its economic problems. 4. Collapse of the Soviet Union: The eventual disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the end of the Cold War and the arms race. The economic hardship faced by the USSR, coupled with growing internal dissent and crumbling political institutions, led the Soviet Union to loosen its grip on Eastern European countries, eventually resulting in the peaceful dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. The US effectively emerged as the sole superpower, reflecting a relative victory in the arms race. In conclusion, while the arms race during the Cold War was characterized by numerous fluctuations and periods of advantage and disadvantage for both the US and the USSR, the United States and its allies are generally regarded as having emerged in a stronger position following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The combination of economic strength, technological advantages, strategic initiatives, and the ultimate fate of the USSR contributed to this assessment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: After a major defeat, what does Brighton advise Faisal to do? Movie title: Lawrence of Arabia Movie plot: The film is presented in two parts, divided by an intermission. Part I[edit] The film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him. The story then moves backward to the First World War, where Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant, notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of General Murray, Mr. Dryden of the Arab Bureau sends him to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal in his revolt against the Turks. On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest. Brighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasimâand Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear. Lawrence persuades Auda abu Tayi, the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a blood feud. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares...

In 2009, sharp drops in commodity prices and the effects of the global financial crisis caused the local currency to drop 40% against the U.S. dollar. Two of the 16 commercial banks were taken into receivership. In 2011, GDP growth was expected to reach 16.4%. However, inflation continued to erode GDP gains, with an average rate of 12.6% expected at the end of 2011.

In 2007 and 2008, Mongolia experienced high growth rates of 9.9% and 8.9% respectively, primarily driven by the mining sector. However, the global financial crisis and a significant drop in commodity prices in 2009 negatively impacted the country's economy, causing the local currency to lose 40% of its value against the U.S. dollar and leading to the receivership of two out of 16 commercial banks. Despite setbacks, in 2011, Mongolia's GDP growth rebounded and was expected to reach 16.4%. However, this growth was accompanied by high inflation rates, averaging 12.6% at the end of 2011, which offset some of the increases in GDP. While Mongolia's GDP rose consistently since 2002 at a rate of 7.5%, according to a 2006 official estimate, the country continued to struggle with a significant trade deficit. The Economist predicted that the trade deficit, equivalent to 14% of Mongolia's GDP, would transform into a surplus in 2013. This projection suggests an eventual improvement in the country's economic situation as a result of the growing mining sector and potential for increased exports.

How did the global financial crisis in 2009 affect Mongolia's economy, specifically its currency and banking sector? 3. What measures have been taken to control inflation in Mongolia, and how effective have these measures been in stabilizing the economy? 4.

The song was released on Bowie's \\"Young Americans\\" album in 1975. At the time, John Lennon was collaborating with several prominent artists, and his friendship with David Bowie resulted in this iconic hit. The song arose from a loose and improvisational session, with Lennon and Bowie feeding off each other's ideas. The creative process and collaboration began at New York's Electric Lady Studios, where Bowie was working on mixing his \\"Young Americans\\" album. During these sessions, Carlos Alomar, a well-respected guitarist, came up with the catchy guitar riff that became the backbone of the song \\"Fame.\\" Alomar had joined Bowie's backing band in 1974 and went on to work with him extensively throughout his career. It is worth noting that the song's title \\"Fame\\" is said to have arisen from a conversation between Bowie and Lennon about the perils of celebrity and how it can negatively impact an artist's life. The outcome of this collaboration resulted in a song that fused elements of funk, soul, and rock, showcasing a departure from Bowie's previous glam rock sound. The song displays a groove-oriented rhythm, and the soulful backing vocals provided by Lennon and Bowie gave it an added depth and texture. \\"Fame\\" became a hit, reaching No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in September 1975. It ultimately became one of David Bowie's most recognizable and successful tracks, and the collaboration with John Lennon still carries historical significance considering the two artists' immense contributions to the world of music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus? , can you please find it? The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly...

Problem:I had my white secretary who typically booked my band and assisted me with my music business set up a meeting with the Maryland grand dragon Roger Kelly explaining that her boss was writing a book on the Klan and would like his input.

Kelly agreed to participate and we secured a room at a Frederick Md. motel where my secretary filled an ice bucket with cans of soda so I could offer my guest a drink. Regardless of how and what he felt about me if he entered my room after seeing the color of my skin I was going to treat him with hospitality. Punctual to the minute there was a knock on the door. The grand nighthawk (the grand dragon’s bodyguard) entered first and then the dragon himself. “Hello ” I began “I’m Daryl Davis.” I offered my palm and Kelly shook my hand as he and the nighthawk introduced themselves. He sat in the chair I had set out and the nighthawk stood at attention beside him . We were both apprehensive of the other and the interview started haltingly. We discussed what he had hoped to achieve by joining the Klan; what his thoughts were on blacks Asians Jews and Hispanics; and whether he thought it would ever be possible for different races to get along. A little while later we heard an inexplicable crackling noise and we both tensed. The dragon and I stared each other in the eye silently asking “What did you just do?” The nighthawk reached for his gun. Nobody spoke. I barely breathed. Even though Kelly had told me he knew that white people were superior to blacks our dialogue continued over the years. He would visit me in my home and I would eventually be a guest in his .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A University of Pittsburgh research professor accused of killing his wife with a lethal dose of cyanide pleaded not guilty Tuesday, according to Mike Manko, spokesman for the Allegheny County District Attorney's office. Robert Ferrante was extradited from West Virginia to Allegheny County Jail in Pennsylvania on Tuesday morning, where he later appeared via video conference at his arraignment, according to the Allegheny County district attorney's office. The arraignment lasted only five minutes. Ferrante pleaded not guilty in the death of his wife, Autumn Klein, 41, former head of women's neurology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, according to the district attorney's office. Several preliminary hearing dates have been set for early next month regarding the custody of Ferrante and Klein's 6-year-old daughter, Cianna, who is in the care of her maternal grandparents, the district attorney's office said. Hearings have also been set regarding Ferrante's assets. Before his arrest on July 25, Ferrante was a researcher and professor of neurological surgery at the University of Pittsburgh. Part of his job included managing a laboratory where he conducted clinical trials using various drugs and chemicals, according to a criminal complaint. Several text messages sent between the couple before Klein's death in April suggest that Ferrante urged Klein to try using creatine to get help her get pregnant, according to the complaint. CNN Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen reports that some people use creatine to build up muscle and may have some medicinal value, but that there is no connection between increased fertility and creatine use. A source close to the case told CNN: \\"One of the theories the prosecution will work off of is that the cyanide was mixed with the creatine that Ferrante was urging his wife to take.\\" One day before Klein fell ill, Ferrante had used his University of Pittsburgh credit card to place an overnight order for more than a half a pound of cyanide. At the time the order was placed, there were no active projects at Ferrante's lab that involved the use of cyanide, according to the complaint. Cyanide is a naturally occurring toxic substance that can be found in seeds of various plants. It is widely distributed throughout research laboratories as a chemical used in scientific experiments. Cyanide interferes with the ability of the body to use oxygen to produce energy, which can lead to rapid death. \\"Cyanide in low doses will make you dizzy, you'll start breathing rapidly, but if you get it in big doses, it can actually make you stop breathing and that's what kills you,\\" Cohen said. On April 17, Allegheny County 911 dispatch received a call from Ferrante requesting medical assistance for his wife, who he said was possibly having a stroke, the complaint read. He described her condition as \\"conscious and breathing, but not alert.\\" When paramedics arrived, they found Klein on the floor of the kitchen with a plastic bag containing creatine. Klein died on April 20. In a statement made to detectives shortly after being informed of Klein's death because of cyanide poisoning, Ferrante said, \\"Why would she do that to herself? Who would do this to her?\\" according to the complaint. A neighbor of the couple told CNN on Tuesday that nothing seemed amiss to her. \\"I've never seen anything to suggest they were anything but a happy couple with a beautiful little girl,\\" Blithe Runsdorf said. She said the family had just gotten back from a trip to Puerto Rico and that they had never seemed happier. Runsdorf added that after his wife's death, Ferrante \\"acted like a guy who had everything pulled out from under him.\\" Ferrante's defense attorney, William Difenderfer, told CNN Tuesday that his client is \\"devastated not only for losing his wife but being accused of it.\\" After a nationwide manhunt, Ferrante was arrested on July 25 in West Virginia. He has also been placed on immediate and indefinite leave, according to University of Pittsburgh spokesman John Andrew Fedele. Ferrante will appear in Allegheny County Court on September 23 for a preliminary hearing regarding the criminal homicide case. Another neighbor to the couple said the community is concerned about the welfare of the couple's daughter, whom he described as \\"essentially an orphan now.\\" The neighbor said it was \\"no secret\\" in the neighborhood that Klein wanted to have another baby. However, Klein told the neighbor's wife that Ferrante did not want another child, said the neighbor, who asked not to be identified. He called the whole situation \\"a tremendous shock\\" and added that this was not the kind of case where someone could say, \\"Oh, there was a lot of fighting.\\" He said he was aware of none of that. He described the couple as \\"dedicated and hard-working\\" and their daughter as \\"bubbly.\\" \\"They were hustling and trying to manage a family and the demands of the American Dream,\\" the neighbor said.

Learning self-defense techniques is crucial to protecting your personal safety. No matter your size, gender, or fitness level, you can learn how to use your body and the objects in your possession to counteract an attacker's advances. In this article, we will outline some practical and easy-to-implement self-defense tips to help you feel more confident and secure in any situation. 1. Use everyday objects as weapons An essential part of self-defense is understanding how to leverage everyday items around you as weapons. Keys, pens, and even rolled-up magazines can provide a suitable defense against an assailant. Hold these items firmly, and learn to strike where it will be most effective, such as the eyes or throat. For example, if you have keys in your hands, grip them between your fingers and use them to jab the attacker in vulnerable areas like their eyes or throat, potentially causing them to release their grip momentarily and allowing you to escape. 2. Perfect the art of powerful kicks Kicks can be potent self-defense moves, especially when you target the lower body of the attacker. A well-placed kick to the knee or groin can cause significant pain and temporarily incapacitate your opponent. Techniques like kicking your attacker as if you were breaking down a door can help maximize the force behind your kick, making it even more effective. 3. Target vulnerable areas with precision When trying to defend yourself from an attacker, targeting vulnerable areas of their body provides a higher likelihood of success. Places like the throat, eyes, and nose can cause intense pain and possibly lead to injury, making it easier for you to escape. You can use your fingers or objects you have on hand to jab or strike these sensitive areas. 4. Utilize your entire body to gain an advantage In a self-defense scenario, your entire body can become a weapon. Quick, powerful punches, headbutts, or elbow strikes can be especially effective when delivered to sensitive areas like the nose. If the attacker is attempting to hold you, use your body's weight and leverage to throw them off balance. 5. Disorient your opponent with unexpected moves Catching your attacker off guard can give you the upper hand in a self-defense situation. An effective technique to disorient your opponent is to clap your hands forcefully over their ears. This action can create a painful, disorienting sound, giving you the opportunity to escape or retaliate. Conclusion: Self-defense doesn't have to be complicated or require years of martial arts training. By utilizing the practical skills outlined in this article, you can better prepare yourself for any threatening situation that may arise. Remember, your personal safety is a priority, and it's essential to be aware of your surroundings and to trust your instincts. Incorporate these self-defense techniques into your skillset to help you feel more confident as you venture out into the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario?, what is it ?","completion":"The last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario is Thomson."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Erich Mielke was born in a tenement in Berlin-Wedding, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire, on 28 December 1907. During the First World War, the neighborhood was known as \\"Red Wedding\\" due to many residents' Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the Soviet secret police, Mielke described his father as \\"a poor, uneducated woodworker,\\" and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Mielke was then put on trial for ordering the shootings of East Germans who were trying to defect to the West. In November 1994, the presiding judge closed the proceedings, ruling that Mielke was not mentally fit to stand trial. During his incarceration, at JVA Moabit corrections officers supplied Mielke with a red telephone like the one in his office at Stasi Headquarters. Although it was not connected to the outside world, Mielke enjoyed having imaginary conversations with non-existent Stasi agents. His other favorite pastime was watching game shows on television. In 1995, parole officers and Mielke's attorneys argued that he was \\"totally confused\\" and obtained his release. At 87 years of age, Erich Mielke was Germany's oldest prison inmate and had been incarcerated for 1,904 days. Days before his release, the Public Prosecutor of Berlin announced that he was \\"not interested in chasing an 87 year old man anymore\\" and that all further prosecution of Mielke had been indefinitely suspended. According to Koehler: [Mielke's] bank account, which held more than 300,000 marks (about US 187,500), was confiscated. Before his arrest in 1989, the most feared man in East Germany had lived in a luxurious home with access to an indoor pool. In addition, he owned a palatial hunting villa, complete with a movie theater, trophy room, 60 servants, and a 15,000 acre hunting preserve. After he was released from prison Mielke was obliged to move into a two room, 600-square-foot flat. Like all Stasi pensioners, he would henceforth have to live on 802 marks (about US512) a month.","completion":"This text is about Erich Mielke, who was born in Berlin in 1907.

Read this: The inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with Louis Daguerre. The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has became iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Gavarni, and Alphonse Mucha.

Translate to English","completion":"Gruevski said, \\"Even if the reforms do not yield the expected result regarding our NATO and EU membership, they are good in terms of improving the quality of life for the country and the people.\\" In this statement, Gruevski acknowledges that the process of implementing reforms in the country may not necessarily guarantee their inclusion into international organizations such as NATO and the European Union. However, he underlines the importance of these reforms as a positive force that can drive improvements in the overall living conditions and well-being for the citizens and the nation as a whole. These reforms may encompass a wide range of areas, such as political, economic, social, and legal changes that are required for the integration into the international community. They may address issues like strengthening democratic institutions, ensuring human rights and freedoms, reducing corruption, enhancing the rule of law, and promoting sustainable economic growth. Moreover, they can contribute to raising the country's international standing and increasing its attractiveness for foreign investors, thus paving the way for greater prosperity and opportunities. Although Gruevski highlights that the reforms might not directly result in achieving NATO and EU membership, it is still crucial to consider the indirect benefits that they can create. One of these benefits is the potential for the country to establish itself as a reliable and responsible partner in the international community. Creating a favorable domestic environment can help promote regional stability, security, and cooperation, which in turn may increase the likelihood of future collaboration with NATO and the EU. Additionally, good governance and robust institutions can facilitate a better quality of life for the people by fostering economic growth, reducing inequalities, promoting social cohesion, and enabling access to essential services such as education and healthcare. Enhanced living conditions can also lead to long-term social benefits, such as increased life expectancy, reduced crime rates, and a more active and empowered citizenry. In conclusion, Gruevski's statement emphasizes the importance of pursuing reforms, even if they do not guarantee membership in NATO and the EU, for the sake of the well-being of the nation and the people. Through these reforms, the country can achieve meaningful progress and create the foundation for a brighter and more prosperous future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Nebyl jsem si jistý, co se děje, ale rozhodl jsem se toto tajemné místo prozkoumat. Zatímco jsem chodil mezi exotickými rostlinami a stromy, objevil jsem několik místních obyvatel. Mluvili jazykem, kterému jsem nerozuměl, ale byli zdvořilí a přátelští. Ukázali mi některé zázračné věci, které jsem nikdy předtím neviděl, jako například pavučiny z duhového hedvábí nebo prameny, které měnily barvu. Poté, co jsem se zaposlouchal, jsem zjistil, že jsem začínal rozumět jejich jazyku. Bylo to téměř magické, jak jsem se přizpůsobil tomuto novému prostředí. Setkal jsem se s moudrým starcem, který mi vyprávěl příběh o tom, jak tento svět vznikl a jak předčil všechny katastrofy a zkázy. Naučil jsem se také, že v tomto snovém světě existuje zvláštní síla, která může splnit přání. Hledal jsem tuto sílu, procházel jsem nejodlehlejšími kouty této země a nacházel sílu v nejzákladnějších elementech. Nakonec jsem našel, co jsem hledal, a setkal jsem se s bytostí zodpovědnou za splnění mých přání. Poprosil jsem ji, aby mi splnila nejskvělejší přání, které mě napadlo. Překvapilo mě, že mi bytost řekla, že mi je schopna splnit pouze jedno přání. Musel jsem tedy důkladně zvážit, co si vyberu. Své přání jsem nakonec vybral a bytost souhlasila. Připravil jsem se na cestu zpátky do mého skutečného života, s vědomím, že tento divný sen mě nějakým způsobem obohatil.

New Market Basket stores could take months to open With Market Basket stores almost fully restocked, the company is aiming to open two or three of the five new stores it has under development by the end of the year, company executives said. The grocery chain’s second-in-command said in an interview Friday that no timeline was in place for opening all of the stores, but that expansion was “on the radar.” “Our 100 percent focus on this moment is to get these [existing] stores restocked with fresh foods, particularly perishable foods, produce, and seafoods,” said David McLean, the company’s operations manager. In a Monday appearance at the Chelsea Market Basket reported on WCVB-TV, company president Arthur T. Demoulas said his goal was to have two or three of those stores open by the end of the year. McLean said executives hoped to discuss expansion and firm up their plans in the next week or two. Once the company decides to open the stores, he said, hiring and training new employees would take six to eight weeks, he said. Of five under development, one store in Revere and another in Attleboro are completely finished and lack only “people and product,” according to Steve Paulenka, a facilities and operations supervisor who organized protests during the six-week work stoppage at Market Basket. A store in Athol is nearly complete, but Paulenka said the distance of the Attleboro and Athol stores from other Market Basket locations could make staffing more difficult. Each store would need about 400 employees, who would be trained at existing supermarkets in the chain. The closest Market Basket to both Attleboro and Athol is about 15 miles away, Paulenka said. Demoulas said Monday that the Market Basket in Revere would probably be the first to open. That store is fully permitted and equipped, according to Tony D’Agosta, the city’s chief health inspector. The store has been complete for a year, but its opening has been bogged down by disputes between Demoulas and the company’s board of directors, controlled by his cousin and chief rival, Arthur S. Demoulas. Despite the distance concerns, the other top candidates to open soon are the Attleboro store, which has been finished for several months, and the Athol location, which would be the chain’s westernmost. Only paving, lighting, and traffic marking work remain at the Athol store, said Tom Koistinen, who managed the store’s construction for general contractor Seppala Construction. At two other stores, more work remains to be done. In Waltham, construction crews are moving “full steam ahead” on an 86,000-square-foot Market Basket store, said Steven Cucinatti of Retail Management and Development Inc., which will manage the plaza where the store is being built. The firm is run by Arthur T. Demoulas’s brothers-in-law. A completion date has not been set, but Paulenka said the store “could be finished this year.” “We have a couple other tenants that are planning on opening as soon as late September, early October,” added Cucinatti. Those tenants are Marshalls, the department store, and Jake n Joes, a sports bar. At the fifth location, in Littleton, a new Market Basket should be finished by mid-October, said Sam Park, who is developing the commercial plaza where the Market Basket will be located. Checkout counters are already in place, but crews are still installing shelving and refrigeration units, said Paulenka, who visited the store on Tuesday. Still, both Paulenka and Park said a late opening was unlikely. November and December are a hectic time for retailers and grocers, and recruiting and training hundreds of new employees could be especially difficult for Market Basket at that time of year. “The closer we get to holidays, the less likely we are to open,” said Paulenka. “We’ve got to get the training done before the holidays or after the holidays.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the Market Basket grocery chain's plans to open new stores.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who said \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental?\\" is inside the article: Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite..., can you guess it ?

I have a new situation: Justin and Thomas are two college students conducting an experiment in their chemistry laboratory course. They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. But I can use this background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. What is an answer for this question: If Thomas wanted the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, should he increase or decrease the temperature of his reactions?","completion":"Given the background information, if Thomas wants the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, he should increase the temperature of his reactions. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature. 2. Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. 3. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. 4. Faster-moving particles are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. 5. Faster collisions result in a faster rate of reaction. 6. Since Justin has a faster rate of reaction due to the higher temperature, Thomas must raise the temperature of his reactions to match Justin's rate. Therefore, Thomas should increase the temperature of his reactions to achieve a similar rate as Justin's reactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was launched in 2012 to help businesses ditch fossil fuels for renewables such as wood. Mrs Foster was the then enterprise minister in charge of the scheme, which was set up to help cut carbon emissions, but its flaws could cost taxpayers £490m. The subsidies offered were greater than the cost of the fuels, meaning users could legitimately earn more cash the more fuel they burned.

But the first minister has rejected Sinn Féin's further calls for her to temporarily step aside. Mr Adams told the meeting: \\"The DUP leader has thus far refused to stand aside, without prejudice, pending a preliminary report by an independent investigation into the RHI scandal. \\"If the first minister does not take the actions that society desires and deserves and which a sustainable process of change requires, then Sinn Féin will bring this ongoing and totally unacceptable state of affairs to an end.\\" Earlier this week, Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir warned that if Mrs Foster did not step aside temporarily, an election would be inevitable. \\"It's the greatest conflict of interest I've seen in my political life that the architect of the RHI scheme would remain in office while the investigation gets under way,\\" he said. Mr Adams said the \\"future of the political institutions are at a defining point\\", as he paid tribute to Mr McGuinness who was not at the meeting. \\"Under Martin's tolerant and tireless leadership the institutions have continued to operate and progress has been made, for example on the difficult issue of the transfer of policing and justice powers,\\" he said. In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Adams spoke about the decision to cut Irish language bursary funds, describing Communities Minister Paul Givan as an \\"ignoramus\\". \\"The DUP has also shown a serious disrespect for the Irish language and to those citizens who wish to live their lives through Gaeilge (Irish language). \\"The decision on the eve of Christmas to cut funding for the Líofa programme was a very deliberate snub to the Irish language.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Two farms had different plant cultivation methods. Jolly farm adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer, while Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides. Which farm caused less Nitrogen to end up in oceans? A:","completion":"Jolly farm, which adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer, would have caused less Nitrogen to end up in oceans compared to Peach farm that continued using fertilizers and pesticides. Permaculture is a sustainable and environmentally conscious approach to agriculture and land management that incorporates various techniques to minimize harmful practices often associated with conventional methods, such as the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. It emphasizes the development of agricultural ecosystems which not only work in harmony with nature, but also are able to regenerate and improve the overall health of the environment. The permaculture techniques implemented by Jolly farm could include the following: 1. Plant diversity: Cultivating a variety of plant species to create a balanced and diverse ecosystem that promotes healthy soil and reduces pests. 2. Crop rotation: Regularly changing the types of crops grown to prevent depletion of nutrients in the soil and to reduce pest populations. 3. Polyculture: Growing multiple crop species together in the same area to maximize space, increase soil fertility, and encourage beneficial relationships amongst plants. 4. Integration of livestock: Allowing animals to graze on the land, contributing to natural fertilization and controlling pests and weeds. 5. Use of organic matter: Utilizing compost, manure, and other organic materials to improve soil quality and provide essential nutrients without the need for chemical fertilizers. 6. Natural pest and weed control: Encouraging biodiversity and employing biological and physical controls instead of synthetic pesticides. In contrast, Peach farm relies on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to support its agricultural production. The use of chemical fertilizers, including those containing high levels of nitrogen, contributes to runoff that ultimately pollutes bodies of water, triggering excessive algal growth and the formation of dead zones. Moreover, pesticides can have detrimental effects on non-target organisms and disrupt the ecological balance. As a result of its implementation of permaculture techniques, Jolly farm would likely contribute much less nitrogen to oceans than the conventional methods employed by Peach farm. The permaculture practices followed by Jolly farm ensure effective nutrient cycling, soil conservation, and water quality protection, thereby reducing chemical runoff and minimizing harmful environmental impacts that could lead to nitrogen pollution in oceans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This part is compatible as well since a red winter coat is still a red coat. 3. \\"Eating and holding up a candy bar\\" vs. \\"eats a candy bar\\": In both sentences, the central action of consuming a candy bar is the same, which makes this part compatible too. However, there is an essential detail in the second sentence that does not match the information provided in the first sentence: 4. \\"Next to a neon sign\\": The second sentence mentions the boy's proximity to a neon sign while eating the candy bar. This detail is not present in the first sentence. It neither confirms nor denies the presence of a neon sign. Most of the elements in the second sentence match the information from the first sentence; however, the presence of a neon sign is unrelated to the data given in the first sentence. As the initial sentence neither confirms nor denies the existence of a neon sign, we cannot definitively conclude that the second sentence is entirely true based on the given information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A velvet blazer is a timeless look that you can wear well after the velvet-revival trend has passed. Some cuts and colors will be more versatile than others, though. Jewel tones like deep reds and blues look gorgeous in velvet and carry the added bonus of transitioning seamlessly from day to night. A form-fitting, structured blazer is most versatile as far as cut goes, while a cropped velvet bomber jacket can be rocked recreationally. Vintage and thrift stores are great places to look for velvet blazers, or you can check out modern retailers Though your velvet blazer is undoubtedly a versatile piece, your go-to velvet jacket can’t go with just anything. Since it has such a conspicuous texture, you need to pair it with subtler textures which will offset the velvet rather than competing with it. Cotton, wool, and cashmere are good, neutral-texture options, while shiny silk, tweed, or lace should be avoided. In order to make your velvet blazer look chic but still casual, you should wear something casual or understated underneath. A neutral camisole or tank top are always solid options for work or play, while a funky band t-shirt can add an edge to the classy, velvet vibe. Stripes are also a great way to make a look more casual without being boring. A striped sweater, tee, blouse, or tank top beneath a velvet blazer adds an interesting, sporty twist to an otherwise formal look. A velvet blazer can go with practically anything, including formal trousers, dresses, skirts, and jeans. In order to make it casual, though, you’ll want to pair it with some jeans. Distressed and light colored jeans are in style, so feel free to experiment with these trendy looks. When in doubt, though, go for a solid, dark-rinse that looks appropriate in a variety of places and milieus. Boot-cut, skinny, and straight leg jeans will pair well with any blazer. Flared jeans are also making a comeback, but be aware that a dramatic flare under your velvet blazer might make your look overly vintage or costumey. Depending on your personal preference, you can top off your look with a variety of footwear. Flat combat boots or knee-highs will create a particularly laid-back feel to your ensemble, while wedges or heeled booties will add some height and polish to your look while still keeping it low-key. Platforms are back in fashion and can play up to the vintage feel of your velvet blazer without seeming overly retro or antiquated. Summary:","completion":"To create a timeless and versatile velvet blazer look, follow these steps: 1. Choose a jewel-tone color like deep red or blue, as they transition well from day to night. 2.

Hillary: Secretary of empowerment Girls hug U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a 2010 tour of a shelter run for sex trafficking victims in Cambodia. Editor's note: Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \\"Cooking with Grease.\\" She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000. (CNN) -- As Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton steps down from her job Friday, many are assuming she will run for president. And she may. In fact, five of the first eight presidents first served their predecessors as secretary of state. It hasn't happened in more than a century, though that may change should Clinton decide to run. After all, she has been a game changer her entire life. But before we look ahead, I think we should appreciate what she's done as secretary of state; it's a high profile, high pressure job. You have to deal with the routine as if it is critical and with crisis as if it's routine. You have to manage egos, protocols, customs and Congress. You have to be rhetorical and blunt, diplomatic and direct. As secretary of state you are dealing with heads of state and with we the people. And the president of the United States has to trust you -- implicitly. On the road with Hillary Clinton Of all Clinton's accomplishments -- and I will mention just a few -- this may be the most underappreciated. During the election, pundits were puzzled and amazed not only at how much energy former President Bill Clinton poured into Obama's campaign, but even more at how genuine and close the friendship was. Obama was given a lot of well-deserved credit for reaching out to the Clintons by appointing then-Sen. Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state in the first place. But trust is a two-way street and has to be earned. We should not underestimate or forget how much Clinton did and how hard she worked. She deserved that trust, as she deserved to be in the war room when Osama bin Laden was killed. By the way, is there any other leader in the last 50 years whom we routinely refer to by a first name, and do so more out of respect than familiarity? The last person I can think of was Ike -- the elder family member who we revere with affection. Hillary is Hillary. It's not surprising that we feel we know her. She has been part of our public life for more than 20 years. She's been a model of dignity, diplomacy, empathy and toughness. She also has done something no other secretary of state has done -- including the two women who preceded her in the Cabinet post. Rothkopf: President Hillary Clinton? If she wants it Become a fan of CNNOpinion Stay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at . We welcome your ideas and comments. Hillary has transformed our understanding -- no, our definition -- of foreign affairs. Diplomacy is no longer just the skill of managing relations with other countries. The big issues -- war and peace, terror, economic stability, etc. -- remain, and she has handled them with firmness and authority, with poise and confidence, and with good will, when appropriate. But it is not the praise of diplomats or dictators that will be her legacy. She dealt with plenipotentiaries, but her focus was on people. Foreign affairs isn't just about treaties, she taught us, it's about the suffering and aspirations of those affected by the treaties, made or unmade. Most of all, diplomacy should refocus attention on the powerless. Of course, Hillary wasn't the first secretary of state to advocate for human rights or use the post to raise awareness of abuses or negotiate humanitarian relief or pressure oppressors. But she was the first to focus on empowerment, particularly of women and girls. She created the first Office of Global Women's Issues. That office fought to highlight the plight of women around the world. Rape of women has been a weapon of war for centuries. Though civilized countries condemn it, the fight against it has in a sense only really begun. Ghitis: Hillary Clinton's global legacy on gay rights The office has worked to hold governments accountable for the systematic oppression of girls and women and fought for their education in emerging countries. As Hillary said when the office was established: \\"When the Security Council passed Resolution 1325, we tried to make a very clear statement, that women are still largely shut out of the negotiations that seek to end conflicts, even though women and children are the primary victims of 21st century conflict.\\" Hillary also included the United States in the Trafficking in Person report. Human Trafficking, a form of modern, mainly sexual, slavery, victimizes mostly women and girls. The annual report reviews the state of global efforts to eliminate the practice. \\"We believe it is important to keep the spotlight on ourselves,\\" she said. \\"Human trafficking is not someone else's problem. Involuntary servitude is not something we can ignore or hope doesn't exist in our own communities.\\" She also created the office of Global Partnerships. And there is much more. She has held her own in palaces and held the hands of hungry children in mud-hut villages, pursuing an agenda that empowers women, children, the poor and helpless. We shouldn't have been surprised. Her book \\"It Takes a Village\\" focused on the impact that those outside the family have, for better or worse, on a child's well-being. As secretary of state, she did all she could to make sure our impact as a nation would be for the better.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Let me start by saying at the young age of 34 I was suddenly widowed. I was devastated as he was NOT sick--- he died unexpectedly basically of a coronary--- his carotids blew out-- he died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation from police, cause he fell on something and it bashed his head in. I was a suspect for murder until the autopsy came back. My children were as traumatized as I was, so in love with a good father figure as he. I had three small children, no education, no financial support. I took it very, very hard. Within two years my in-laws attacked me verbally, physically, emotionally and spiritually demanding I grieve not in front of the children, and put on masks and showed people what they wanted to see, not show them my pain during holidays... Nobody stood up for me and my choice to sit out one holiday, except of course, the grief therapist I was seeing that had advised me to follow my heart and soul. My in-laws didn't get it! It changed FOREVER my relationship with them, and I have never been back for a holiday. This is only one example of how my grief was disrespected! My own (new) husband has seen me fall apart talking about the trauma when I shared from my soul. I collapse, can not breathe, hyperventilate, and generally am defunct for a few days if I even try to convey the hidden pain. Now about this movie... Today, my soul was stirred, my heart broken. My fears and pain re-surfaced from the real demons this movie presents; how one grieves compared to how others expect us too and the demons within. Adam Sandler portrayed perfectly the horrendous agony you face, overcome and most of all, work through on your own time! This movie dredged up all the pain that I have tried over the years to deal with. You see, when something harms your soul so profoundly, so deep that utterances are all that come from your mouth in moments of thinking, you can not deal with it without wishing you were dead and walking through life, in a dead state. The bible has a scripture, Romans 8:26 that I have clung to, that when my mouth and soul know not what to pray for, that God's Holy Spirit carries that agony to the feet of God-- I need not speak. Sandler portrayed that to perfection! There is a scene where he has been hauled into a court hearing, for mental health commitment purposes, and he goes back in to face his in-laws--- (familiar to me)--- and he tells them the stunning truths that he has been possessed by, per Se, that he can't get over. It's a profoundly strong, and mighty performance. I started bawling and had a hard time after wards getting up to walk out from the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so. My son was with me and saw it first hand, my precise motions while trying to hold it all together; a lesson for him, my youngest who barely remembers his daddy. It's been 13 years for me but this movie brought me back to the moment of losing my in-laws forever when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my surrendering to their desires, instead of respect to my own. I write this, so that if you are a griever, you are prepared for this movie, but recommend it highly in the 1000 star performance Sandler gave. If you are not yet a griever, please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief, letting them find peace in their own time! Sometimes, the soul can not utter the words to convey our pain. Go see this movie with tissues and not without preparing to take it in... to your soul!

If I tell you that Threatening behavior triggers stress within animals, and ask you the question \\"what do animals feel when threatened?\\", is the correct answer \\"cold\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"cold.\\" When animals feel threatened, they typically experience a range of emotions and physiological responses rather than just feeling \\"cold.\\" These responses are primarily associated with the activation of the stress response system, also known as the \\"fight-or-flight\\" response. The primary purpose of this response is to prepare animals to confront or avoid a potential threat. When animals feel threatened, they often experience: 1. Fear: This is the most common emotion experienced by animals when they perceive a threat. Fear is a natural response that helps them react appropriately to danger. It can also help animals learn to avoid similar situations in the future. 2. Anxiety: Anxiety occurs when animals anticipate a potential threat even if it is not currently present. This heightened state of vigilance and wariness can be useful in preventing animals from being caught off-guard by an actual threat. 3. Increased heart rate and blood pressure: When animals perceive a threat, their bodies respond by increasing their heart rate and blood pressure. This allows oxygen and nutrients to be delivered more quickly to the muscles and organs, preparing the animal for action. 4. Heightened senses: In response to a potential threat, animals often experience heightened senses. This can include an increased ability to detect sights, sounds, and smells which may signal the presence of danger. 5. Release of stress hormones: Animals experiencing a threat will release stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones help modulate the body's response to stress, preparing it for action. 6. Changes in body temperature: While it's not accurate to say that animals will feel \\"cold\\" when threatened, changes in body temperature may occur. For instance, some animals might experience a piloerection, or \\"goosebumps,\\" which can help them appear larger to intimidate the threat. Additionally, blood flow may be redirected to more vital organs, which might result in changes to peripheral body temperature. 7. Defensive or aggressive behaviors: Depending on the nature of the threat and the animal's temperament, it may choose to display defensive or aggressive behaviors to deter the threat. This can include hissing, growling, baring teeth, or even physical attack. In conclusion, animals feel a complex range of emotions and physiological responses when threatened, which work together to help them effectively cope with potential danger. While it is incorrect to say that animals simply feel \\"cold\\" when threatened, it is important to note that their bodies undergo various changes to prepare them for a fight-or-flight response."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Republic of Cyprus has de jure sovereignty over the island of Cyprus and its surrounding waters, according to international law, except for the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, administered as Sovereign Base Areas. However, the Republic of Cyprus is de facto partitioned into two main parts; the area under the effective control of the Republic, comprising about 59% of the island's area, and the north, administered by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is recognised only by Turkey, covering about 36% of the island's area.

First of America Bank Corp. said it completed its acquisition of Midwest Financial Group Inc. for about 250 million. First of America, which now has 45 banks and 12.5 billion in assets, announced an agreement to acquire the Peoria, Ill., bank holding company in January. Midwest Financial has 2.3 billion in assets and eight banks.

Question: Combine facts and answer this: What is the name of the company which sells Nespresso products, which were first invented by engineer Eric Favre in 1974? Answer:","completion":"The name of the company that sells Nespresso products is Nestlé Nespresso S.A., which is a subsidiary of the Swiss multinational food and beverage conglomerate, Nestlé Group. Nestlé Nespresso specializes in the production, distribution, and sale of single-serve coffee capsules, machines, and related accessories. Nespresso's journey began when the inventor and engineer, Eric Favre, was inspired to create a revolutionary and user-friendly espresso machine back in 1974. At the time, Favre worked for Nestlé in their research and development department, and the motivation for his invention was heavily influenced by his desire to replicate the high-quality Italian espresso experience within the comfort of one's home or office. Eric Favre's innovative concept involved the use of a single-serve, pre-measured, and hermetically sealed coffee capsule to ensure consistent quality and freshness. These Nespresso capsules were designed to work in harmony with specialized espresso machines that utilize high pressure to extract the coffee, resulting in a rich and aromatic cup of espresso with a layer of crema on top. After nearly a decade of research and development, the first Nespresso system was launched in 1986. Initially, it targeted mainly the professional market, introducing the coffee machines to offices and upscale establishments. But over time, the Nespresso system has successfully evolved and expanded into the consumer market as a premium and quality-driven coffee brand. Currently, Nespresso products are available in over 60 countries worldwide, with a global network of boutiques, a comprehensive online presence, and strategic partnerships that cater to a rapidly growing consumer base. In summary, Nestlé Nespresso S.A. is the company responsible for selling Nespresso products, which were first invented by the engineer Eric Favre in 1974. The innovative single-serve capsule system, combined with the advanced espresso machines, offers premium coffee experiences at home or in offices and continues to attract coffee enthusiasts seeking convenience, quality, and consistency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago.

Lindsey Graham said on Sunday the inability to track Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev is either a failure of the FBI or of U.S. laws. “The ball was dropped in one of two ways,” Graham (R-S.C.) said on CNN’s State of the Union.” “The FBI missed a lot of things, is one potential answer, or our laws do not allow the FBI to follow up in a sound solid way.” Graham said one of the suspects was an obvious red flag because of his activity online where he talked about killing Americans, and because of his travels into radical areas. “It’s people like this that you don’t want to let out of your sight, and this was a mistake,” he said. “Either our laws are insufficient or the FBI failed, but we’re at war with radical Islamists and we need to up our game.” Read more about: Lindsey Graham, FBI, Boston Marathon, Tamerlan Tsarnaev ||||| Surveillance video from the Boston Marathon attack shows one suspect dropping his backpack and calmly walking away from it before the bomb inside exploded, Massachusetts Gov.

Investigators have determined the bombs were fashioned from pressure cookers packed with explosives, nails and ball bearings and hidden in black backpacks. Three people were killed and more than 180 injured when the two bombs exploded Monday about four hours into the race.

The FBI says the two brothers and suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing killed an MIT police officer,... (Associated Press) As Boston-area residents came together in prayer and reflection after a tumultuous week, the lone surviving suspect in the bombing lay hospitalized under heavy guard apparently in no shape for interrogation. What 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will say and when are unclear. He remained in serious condition two days after being pulled bloody and wounded from a tarp-covered boat in a Watertown backyard. The capture came at the end of a tense Friday that began with his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, dying in a gun battle with police. There was no immediate word on when Tsarnaev might be charged and what those charges would be. The twin bombings killed three people and wounded more than 180. The most serious charge available to federal prosecutors would be the use of a weapon of mass destruction to kill people, which carries a possible death sentence. Massachusetts does not have the death penalty. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis told CBS' \\"Face the Nation\\" that authorities found an arsenal of homemade explosives after Friday's gun battle between police and the two suspects. \\"We have reason to believe, based upon the evidence that was found at that scene _ the explosions, the explosive ordnance that was unexploded and the firepower that they had _ that they were going to attack other individuals,\\" Davis said. \\"That's my belief at this point.\\" The scene of the gun battle was loaded with unexploded bombs, and authorities had to alert arriving officers to them and clear the scene, Davis said. One improvised explosive device was found in the Mercedes the brothers are accused of carjacking, he said. \\"This was as dangerous as it gets in urban policing,\\" Davis said. U.S. officials said the elite interrogation team would question Tsarnaev, a Massachusetts college student, without reading him his Miranda rights, which guarantees the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. Such an exception is allowed on a limited basis when the public may be in immediate danger, such as instances in which bombs are planted and ready to go off. American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero said the legal exception applies only when there is a continued threat to public safety and is \\"not an open-ended exception\\" to the Miranda rule. The federal public defender's office in Massachusetts said it has agreed to represent Tsarnaev once he is charged. Miriam Conrad, public defender for Massachusetts, said he should have a lawyer appointed as soon as possible because there are \\"serious issues regarding possible interrogation.\\" But Republican Rep. Mike Rogers told NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\" that he's not worried that the government has decided against reading the suspect his rights. Rogers said FBI agents need to know whether there are other bombs more than they need to use in court what the suspect might tell them. Rogers, a former FBI agent, said there is so much evidence against the suspect that a conviction should be easy. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said Sunday that surveillance video from Monday's Boston Marathon attack shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev dropping his backpack and calmly walking away from it before the bomb inside it exploded. \\"It does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, put it down, did not react when the first explosion went off and then moved away from the backpack in time for the second explosion,\\" Patrick told NBC television. \\"It's pretty clear about his involvement and pretty chilling, frankly.\\" He added, however, that he hasn't viewed all the tapes but had been briefed by law enforcement about them. President Barack Obama said there are many unanswered questions about the bombing, including whether the Tsarnaev brothers - ethnic Chechens from southern Russia who had been in the U.S. for about a decade and lived in the Boston area - had help from others. The president urged people not to rush judgment about their motivations. Speaking on \\"Face the Nation,\\" Patrick said that he has no idea what motivated the suspects. The governor said it's hard to imagine why someone would deliberately harm \\"innocent men, women and children in the way that these two fellows did.\\" Patrick also said law enforcers believe the immediate threat ended when police killed one suspect and captured the other. Patrick said Saturday afternoon that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was in serious but stable condition and was probably unable to communicate. Tsarnaev was at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where 11 victims of the bombing were still being treated. On Sunday, family and friends attended a wake at a funeral home in Medford, Massachusetts, for Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant worker, who was one one of the three people killed in the marathon bombing. A private funeral is scheduled for Monday. Eight-year-old Martin Richard of Boston's Dorchester neighborhood and 23-year-old Lu Lingzi, a Boston University graduate student from China, also died in the attacks. BU is holding a memorial service for Lu on Monday. On Sunday, a Boston synagogue opened its doors to worshippers from Trinity Church, which sits in the shadow of the Marathon finish line and remains closed. An interfaith service will also be held Sunday near the finish line where people set up a make-shift memorial as police cleared away debris from the bombing. The Rev. Nancy Taylor of the Old South Church said worshippers will be showing solidarity with the bombing victims. Cardinal Sean O'Malley was offering a Mass to pray for those killed and injured in the attack and manhunt for the suspects. The service will also honor police, firefighters, emergency medical technicians and doctors who saved lives. The all-day manhunt Friday brought the Boston area to a near standstill and put people on edge across the metropolitan area. The break came around nightfall when a homeowner in Watertown saw blood on his boat, pulled back the tarp and saw a bloody Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding inside, police said. After an exchange of gunfire, he was seized and taken away in an ambulance. Raucous celebrations erupted in and around Boston, with chants of \\"USA! USA!\\" Residents flooded the streets in relief four days after the two pressure-cooker bombs packed with nails and other shrapnel went off. During the long night of violence leading up to the capture, the Tsarnaev brothers killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer, severely wounded another lawman and took part in a furious shootout and car chase in which they hurled homemade explosives at police, authorities said. Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau said one of the explosives was the same type used during Monday's Boston Marathon attack, and authorities later recovered a pressure cooker lid that had embedded in a car down the street. He said the suspects also tossed two grenades before Tamerlan Tsarnaev ran out of ammunition and police tackled him. But while handcuffing him, officers had to dive out of the way as Dzhokhar drove the carjacked Mercedes at them, Deveau said. The sport utility vehicle dragged Tamerlan's body down the block, he said. Police initially tracked the escaped suspect by a blood trail he left behind a house after he abandoned the Mercedes, negotiating his surrender hours later. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is tracing the weapons to try to determine how they were obtained by the suspects. Chechnya, where the Tsarnaev family has roots, has been the scene of two wars between Russian forces and separatists since 1994. That spawned an Islamic insurgency that has carried out deadly bombings in Russia and the region, although not in the West. Investigators have not offered a motive for the Boston attack. But in interviews with officials and those who knew the Tsarnaevs, a picture has emerged of the older one as someone embittered toward the U.S., increasingly vehement in his Muslim faith and influential over his younger brother. The Russian FSB intelligence service told the FBI in 2011 about information that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a follower of radical Islam, two law enforcement officials said Saturday. According to an FBI news release, a foreign government said that Tamerlan Tsarnaev appeared to be a strong believer and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the U.S. for travel to a region in Russia to join unspecified underground groups. The FBI did not name the foreign government, but the two officials said it was Russia. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the matter publicly. The FBI said that in response, its agents interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and relatives, and did not find any domestic or foreign terrorism activity. The bureau said it looked into such things as his telephone and online activity, his travels and his associations with others. An uncle of the Tsarnaev brothers said he had a falling-out with Tamerlan over the man's increased commitment to Islam. Ruslan Tsarni from Maryland said Tamerlan told him in a 2009 phone conversation that he had chosen \\"God's business\\" over work or school. Tsarni said he then contacted a family friend who told him Tsarnaev had been influenced by a recent convert to Islam. Tsarni said his relationship with his nephew basically ended after that call. As for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, \\"he's been absolutely wasted by his older brother. I mean, he used him. He used him for whatever he's done,\\" Tsarni said. Albrecht Ammon, a downstairs-apartment neighbor of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in Cambridge, said in an interview that the older brother had strong political views about the United States. Ammon quoted Tsarnaev as saying that the U.S. uses the Bible as \\"an excuse for invading other countries.\\" Tamerlan Tsarnaev studied accounting as a part-time student at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston for three semesters from 2006 to 2008, the school said. He was married with a young daughter. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. The college was evacuated Friday, but officials said residence and dining halls will reopen Sunday. As of Saturday, more than 50 victims of the bombing remained hospitalized, three in critical condition. ___ Associated Press writers Bridget Murphy , Katie Zezima, Denise Lavoie and Steve Peoples in Boston; Mike Hill in Watertown, Massachusetts; Colleen Long in New York; Pete Yost in Washington; Eric Tucker in Montgomery Village, Maryland; and AP Sports Writer Jimmy Golen in Boston contributed to this report. ||||| Boston Mayor Thomas Menino lashed out on Sunday at the Tsarnaev brothers for the marathon bombings that killed three an wounded scores more. \\"I hope that the U.S. attorney, Carmen Ortiz, takes them on the federal side and throws the book at them,\\" he said on ABC's \\"This Week.\\" \\"These two individuals held the city hostage for five days.\\" Menino revealed that the investigation so far has not turned up any additional suspects. \\"All the information I have is they acted alone,\\" he said.

Peter King blasted the FBI on Sunday for failing to prevent the Tsarnaev brothers from carrying out the Boston Marathon bombings when the agency had already been told about the older brother's extremist potential. \\"This is at least the fifth case I'm aware of where the FBI has failed to stop someone,\\" the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence said on \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" King, a Republican from New York, ticked off cases such as Anwar al-Awlaki, who planned terrorist attacks as part of al Qaeda; Carlos Bledsoe, who opened fire in in front of a military recruiting office in Little Rock, Ark., in 2009; and Nidal Malik Hasan, who opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009. \\"This is the latest in a series of cases like this...where the FBI is given information about someone as being a potential terrorist,\\" King said. \\"They look at them, and then they don’t take action, and then they go out and commit murders.\\" The FBI questioned Tamerlan Tsarnaev about two years ago on the request of the Russian government, but concluded he was not a threat. King said Tsarnaev should have been flagged and monitored at the least. \\"He has statements up on his web site, he’s talking about radical imams,\\" he said. King said law enforcement needs to focus more intently on the Muslim community, where the terror threat is emanating from, even though 99 percent of Muslims are law-abiding, good people. \\"If you know a threat is coming from a certain community, you have to go after that,\\" he said. Read more about: Peter King, Boston Marathon, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ||||| Former White House counter-terrorism adviser Richard Clarke said on Sunday one of the most dangerous impacts of the Boston bombings is that it showed other radicals just how easy it was to pull off. \\"Now that people have seen what two men can do with easily obtainable materials -- close down a city, get the president of the United States to show up,\\" Clarke said on ABC's \\"This Week with George Stephanopoulos. \\"Other people around the country who have been radicalized have watched this, and they're going to wonder, is there a way now that I can do this?\\" Clarke, who worked under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the FBI has done a good job of ensnaring potential terrorists by setting them up -- \\"pretending to be Al Qaeda\\" -- and then going after them for plotting attacks before they can carry them out. But Clarke said the events in Boston provided a dangerous example for \\"self-radicalized\\" extremists who may have previously thought carrying out such an act was too difficult to attempt. While the FBI has been criticized for failing to stop the Tsarnaev brothers despite being warned by Russia of the older brother's potential extremism, Clarke wants to know what the Russian government did with the information. The older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, spent six months in Russia last year. \\"What I want to know is what did the Russians do when he went back to Russia?\\" Clarke said. \\"What did they do, did they follow him around?\\" Read more about: Richard Clarke, Boston Marathon, Tamerlan Tsarnaev |||||Summary:","completion":"Senator Lindsey Graham stated that the inability to track Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev is either a failure of the FBI or of U.S. laws. One of the suspects was an obvious red flag due to his activity online, discussing killing Americans and his travels to radical areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did Donald Trump ask his supporters to not pay attention to Democrats? Options: A. Because he wanted to win, with no other reason B. Because Democrats were insulting Trump C. not enough information D. Because opinion polls said they had an edge The answer to this question is:","completion":"D. Because opinion polls said they had an edge In the context provided, President Donald Trump asked his supporters not to pay attention to the Democrats who insisted they had the House all but won in November. This is due to opinion polls that gave Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November. Trump aimed to motivate his supporters to be proactive, fight for their cause, and not be complacent. He emphasized the need to go out and vote, as well as expressing optimism about Republicans' chances in both the House and Senate, especially given the strong economy at the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The Admiral Graf Spee, a German heavy cruiser, took refuge in the neutral country of Uruguay after its epic battle with British warships during World War II. This specific encounter is known as the Battle of the River Plate which took place on December 13, 1939, and was the first major naval battle of the war. To provide some context, the Admiral Graf Spee, commanded by Captain Hans Langsdorff, was operating in the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean prior to the battle as a commerce raider, aiming to disrupt the vital trade routes of the British Empire. In response to the Admiral Graf Spee's activities, the British Royal Navy's Force G, comprising three cruisers – the HMS Exeter, HMS Ajax, and HMNZS Achilles, led by Commodore Henry Harwood – was tasked with hunting down the German heavy cruiser. On December 13, 1939, the two forces discovered each other off the coast of South America, near the estuary of the River Plate which lies between Argentina and Uruguay. The ensuing battle saw both sides sustaining significant damage, with the Admiral Graf Spee eventually breaking off from the engagement to head for the nearest neutral port to carry out much-needed repairs. The chosen port was Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. Upon arriving at Montevideo, Captain Langsdorff requested permission from the Uruguayan authorities to remain there for a period of two weeks in order to repair the extensive damage sustained by the Graf Spee during the battle. However, according to international law governing neutral countries during wartime, belligerent warships were allowed a maximum stay of 72 hours in a neutral port. This forced Langsdorff to make a difficult decision. Meanwhile, the British used deception and misinformation tactics by broadcasting false reports of the arrival of more powerful British warships in the area to create a sense of urgency to leave the port as well as to overwhelm the German captain with the perceived threat. Faced with the prospect of going up against superior British forces or becoming interned in a neutral country, Captain Langsdorff decided to take the Graf Spee out of Montevideo and made the fateful decision to scuttle the ship in the River Plate estuary on December 17, 1939, to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. Following this, Langsdorff and the crew sought asylum in Argentina, where the captain eventually took his own life. In conclusion, after the epic Battle of the River Plate, the German heavy cruiser Admiral Graf Spee took refuge in Montevideo, Uruguay. The combination of international maritime law, British intelligence efforts, and the captain's subsequent decision to scuttle the ship made this incident a significant early event in World War II's naval history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Breaking down the phrase: The first step in translating any text is to understand its structure and components. The phrase \\"As simple as creating the accounts you need and move money between them!\\" can be broken down into the following main components: \\"As simple as\\", \\"creating the accounts\\", \\"you need\\", \\"and\\", \\"move money\\", \\"between them\\". 2. Translating each component: Now that we have the components, we need to translate each of them to Russian. - \\"As simple as\\" can be translated as \\"Так же просто, как\\" - \\"creating the accounts\\" can be translated as \\"создание учетных записей\\" - \\"you need\\" can be translated as \\"вам нужно\\" - \\"and\\" can be translated as \\"и\\" - \\"move money\\" can be translated as \\"перемещать деньги\\" - \\"between them\\" can be translated as \\"между ними\\" 3. Forming the translated sentence: Now that we have all components in Russian, we can form the complete sentence. Here we also pay attention to any grammatical adjustments required for the sentence to make sense in Russian. The sentence would sound like: \\"Так же просто, как создать учетные записи, которые вам нужны, и перемещать деньги между ними!\\" This is the literal translation of the sentence. It would also make sense to a Russian speaker and conveys the same idea as the English sentence.

Although the Bears now trailed the Packers in the all-time series, they were the five-point favorite against Green Bay among bookkeepers for the first time since week sixteen of 2008. The odds had been influenced by Aaron Rodgers' season-ending collarbone injury in October along with backup quarterback Brett Hundley's struggles in the previous week's 30-17 loss to the Lions. Although the Bears had not defeated the Packers at home since 2010, the Packers were 2-3 since the two teams' last meeting in week four, while Green Bay head coach Mike McCarthy was 1-3 against the Bears without Rodgers. Jeff Joniak described his ideal Bears offensive gameplan as \\"laying a clean game\\" to avoid swinging the \\"tempo or momentum in favor of a team that's on a three-game losing streak.\\" To do this, Mitchell Trubisky would have to avoid getting sacked, while the running game would have to reduce its runs resulting in negative yardage. Through the air, the Bears remained an unknown entity due to a lack of available film on Trubisky and receivers Markus Wheaton and Dontrelle Inman, the latter making his Bears debut in week ten after being traded to the team in late October. On defense, Joniak wrote the unit needed to prevent Hundley from developing his accuracy, especially as the Chicago defense was excelling in preventing touchdowns, along with containing running back Ty Montgomery, who recorded 162 rushing yards on 16 carries against the Bears in week sixteen last year. In a game that ChicagoBears.com writer Larry Mayer described as having \\" to an early-season trend, the Bears shot themselves in the foot repeatedly,\\" Chicago struggled with penalties during the game as the team committed seven in the first half. The Bears punted on the first drive, which led to an exchanging of field goals on Mason Crosby's 40- and Connor Barth's 45-yard kicks. Three drives later, in the second quarter, Montgomery scored on a 37-yard touchdown run to give the Packers the lead. On the next drive, Trubisky threw a screen pass to Benny Cunningham, who ran to the Packers' goal line and dived for the pylon. His knee landed out of bounds and the play was ruled as such at the two-yard line, which the Bears challenged with the belief that the ball had reached the pylon before he went out; instead, the challenge went against the Bears when it was determined he had lost the ball before it had touched the pylon, resulting in a touchback and possession being granted to the Packers. Chicago eventually added three more points on Barth's 44-yard field goal as time expired in the first half. Crosby kicked a 24-yard field goal on the first drive of the second half, which was followed by one from 50 yards in the fourth quarter. The Bears ended their touchdown-scoring troubles (scoring just one touchdown in 35 drives across the previous four games) when Trubisky threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to Josh Bellamy, who escaped Davon House for the score. However, the Packers responded with a 75-yard drive that ended with Hundley's 19-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams. Barth added a 49-yard field goal to draw the Bears within a touchdown, and remained in contention when Crosby missed a 35-yarder wide right with 1:02 left in the game. After completing an 11-yard pass to Kendall Wright, Trubisky's next three passes were incomplete. On fourth-and-ten, Trubisky passed to Cunningham for five yards, who lateraled to Hroniss Grasu and ran two yards before he was tackled for a turnover on downs.

The discussion revolves around the players' performance, the coaches' strategies, and the game's overall progression.

The acting by the two leading men was terrible, especially the white guy. The girl should have won an Oscar compared to those two. This movie was filled with what I guess would be inside jokes for film industry people and a few other jokes that I actually understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without these laugh-out-loud moments I would have given this film 2/10. What happened to the Alex Cox who made all the 80s classics?

What did his daughter say he got 100 people fired from his last job? Why was she breaking her own stuff when she was mad at him?

The reviewer starts by mentioning their disappointment in the low budget movie and the expectation of much more from an Alex Cox film. They criticize the acting of the two leading men, especially the white guy, which shows their dissatisfaction with the performances in the movie. However, they do compliment the girl's acting, saying she should have won an Oscar compared to the other two. Despite being filled with inside jokes for the film industry people and some parts that made the reviewer laugh out loud, these moments seem to be insufficient to warrant positive sentiment. The questions that the reviewer had after the movie was over also contribute to the negative sentiment, as it implies that certain aspects of the plot were poorly explained or confusing. Furthermore, their reluctance to go to the Q&A after the movie due to the inconvenient timing is another point to consider when determining the overall sentiment of the review. In summary, the negative sentiment is evident in the review through the criticism of acting, disappointment in the film's execution, and confusion regarding the plot.

The hurricane hit Dune city, but missed Shore city by 50 miles. The damage was horrendous. Which city experienced less damage from rainfall? Hint: So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher.

The family of the Boston bombing suspects has received more than 100,000 in welfare benefits over the last decade, according to the Boston Herald. Details of the benefits - which included cash, food stamps and housing assistance - are contained within more than 500 documents that were handed over from Massachusetts welfare officials to a committee of state lawmakers on Monday. The documents have not been released publicly, but a person who has reviewed them told the Herald that the 'breadth of the benefits the family was receiving was stunning.' In need: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, left on April 20 in Cambridge, and her husband, right in 2009, began receiving welfare shortly after the birth of their daughter. Example: The suspects' parents Zubeidat, left, and Anzor, right both at a news conference on Thursday in Dagestan, Russia, also received federal and state welfare benefits when they lived in the U.S. The Herald also spoke to. Massachusetts Rep. David Linsky about the documents, who promised a. thorough review of the assistance that the family received. 'I can assure members of the public. that this committee will actively review every single piece of. information we can find because clearly the public has a substantial. right to know what benefits, if any, this family or individuals accused. of some horrific crimes were receiving,' said Linsky, the committeeâ€™s. chairman. It has been previously reported that deceased Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his wife Katherine relied on food stamps and public assistance from 2011 to 2012, soon after they became parents. Last Friday, the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance detailed how the couple received food stamps from September 2011 to November 2012. The couple, who married in June 2010, are believed to have become parents to their daughter, Zahara, in 2011, in the months before they began receiving the aid. First born: Tamerlan and Katherine's daughter Zahara, pictured this week with her grandmother Judith Russell in Rhode Island, is believed to have been born in 2011. In addition to food stamps, the young. family also benefited from TAFDC (Transitional Aid to Families with. Dependent Children), a program for low income parents with dependent. children. TAFDC is paid out twice a month and can be directly deposited into a recipient's bank account. The assistance was paid to Katherine, since a person must be a U.S. citizen, or eligible non-citizen, to receive the aid. Food Stamps:. Oct. 2002 to Nov. 2004: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps. Aug. 2009 to Dec. 2011: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps. Sep. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev received food stamps. Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (TAFDC):. Jan. 2003 to March 2003: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money. Aug. 2009 to June 2010: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money. Sept. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev collected TAFDC money. While. the couple took the government aid, the 24-year-old Rhode Island native. would sometimes clock as many as 80 hours a week while. her unemployed husband stayed at home. Ultimately his wife's income made the couple ineligible for welfare and they stopped receiving state money in November 2012. Welfare officials have been forced to. divulge details of the aid that was paid out to the family of the. bombing suspects. Mass. Gov. Patrick Deval told state agencies last week that they should not discuss the details of what. government assistance Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had received, citing privacy concerns. Welfare information is not. available for public release unless the person in question provides their. consent, but it is available to lawmakers. Massachusetts State. Rep. David Linsky called on the state's Department of Transitional Assistance to provide him with the information. Linksy issued an ultimatum on Thursday to welfare officials,. giving them 24 hours to provide the information. The letter from Rep. Linsky was provided to the Boston Herald. 'My office is working to fully comply with your request,' DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan wrote in his report to Rep. Linsky, saying they were only providing a summary 'given the great interest in this matter.' In addition to the aid paid out to Tamerlan and his wife, both alleged bombers had benefited from welfare since their parents Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev collected foodstamps and TAFDC - from 2002 to 2004 and again in 2009 to 2011. Breadwinner: Lawyers for Katherine Russell (pictured in high school yearbook photos) said the 24-year-old mother worked tirelessly as a home healthcare aid to support her young family. Her husband was unemployed. Since the. Tsarnaevs are Chechen immigrants, some wondered why they received aid. But the state agency explained that they were considered eligible for. the public assistance. 'The Tsarnaev parents were eligible to. receive benefits as legal, non-citizen residents who were granted asylum. status and met the basic eligibility criteria for DTA, including. household income levels, presence of dependent children and other. factors,' the DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan said in a letter. addressed to David Linsky, Chairman of the House Post Audit and. Oversight Committee. The Herald had reported that sources who knew Tamerlan said that though he sported a flashy appearance, he failed to earn very. much money for his family and was essentially a stay-at-home dad. His younger brother, on the other hand, has been described as more entrepreneurial. Family: Zubeidat Tsarnaev, center with Tamerlan, and the child's father, Anzor, left, received state aid multiple times from 2002 to 2011 (pictured with an uncle Muhamad Suleimanov (right) in an undated photo) Dzhokhar, who was a sophomore at. University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, attended the school on a. scholarship and earned petty cash selling marijuana, sources told the. Boston Globe. Investigators are scrutinizing the. brothers' source of income, as they probe whether the pair received. outside assistance for their attack, either from a radical group or. foreign government. Security experts have noted though. that the modus operandi was relatively cheap, estimating that the. materials for each of the pressure cooker bombs used at the Boston. Marathon attack could have cost a total of 100 each. Tamerlan, 26,. died early on. April 19 after a shoot-out with police in Watertown, Mass. His. 19-year-old brother was captured late on April 19 after an extensive. manhunt. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Natalie Usher told BBC Radio Scotland the delays were due to the complications of working with the private sector. The plan being considered is for a studio in Cumbernauld, close to the site used by the TV series Outlander. Talks on the project are ongoing. Ms Usher, a member of the Film Studio Delivery Group, was set up three years ago, said: \\"We want a private sector led studio and we are committed to deliver that for Scotland. It is essential. \\"It is notoriously difficult to make a studio work. We are committed to delivering it but it's not easy.\\" Creative Scotland and Scottish Enterprise have been in talks with a private developer since last year. In the meantime, a second proposal - entirely privately funded - has been submitted. Pentland Studios Ltd want to build a combined Film Studio and backlot on a 50-acre site at Straiton, Midlothian. But Midlothian Council has so far failed to give planning permission, and the company has asked the Scottish government to call it in for further inquiry. Ms Usher said Creative Scotland was happy to support the project - as well as developing a public studio option. \\"We are open to other proposals - not just one thing,\\" she said. \\"Pentlands is a mixed-use facility. It's a fantastic proposition which we would be happy to see happen.\\" But those who work in the industry believe Scotland is in danger of missing out to other more pro-active areas of the UK. Mandy Sykes who has worked as an actress and a director said: \\"The backers aren't going to be around for ever. \\"This low ambition, 'make do and mend' attitude is not going to work. We need to raise the ceiling in Scotland or we will never have a film industry which supplies and supports and creates wealth for our workers.\\" She's one of thousands who've signed a petition supporting the Pentlands Studio, but she believes it doesn't rule out a public studio as well. \\"There's room for both. This would start a system of studios but it's important to do something now. It's there to go. It just needs planning permission,\\" she said. \\"We're losing business at the moment. There were six feature films that filmed here in 2011 - and they all went back to London to do their studio work. So we got 0.6 % of the UK share. We are losing out on that money which would filter down to indigenous films and local crews.\\" Assistant director Tommy Gormley agrees. Earlier this week, he wrote an open letter to Creative Scotland and Scottish Enterprise to say he thought any further delay in building a studio would be \\"catastrophic\\" for the industry. \\"At the moment the UK tax advantage for film making is extremely attractive,\\" he said. \\"Film making is an amazing fusion of industry and art and that industrial process brings a lot of work, a lot of jobs and we're missing out on that. \\"Ten years ago, the Northern Ireland industry was nowhere and now they're massively overtaking us. The studios in Northern Ireland and Wales are not a drain on resources. They are bringing money to those countries.\\" He added: \\"I'm not asking for a publicly financed studio. It could be private. It could be public. It could be either/or but the lack of ambition from the people in charge, I find quite staggering.\\" He also warned of a talent drain. \\"Scotland is not a backwater, never has been, but we are gradually losing our crew base. I was on the set of Wonder Woman yesterday and I counted nine highly skilled Scottish technicians in London because nothing was happening in their home country. \\"Scotland has the personnel available but they're gradually being leeched away because there's nothing happening and the spend is so low.\\" But not everyone agrees that a public film studio is a wise investment. Michael Caton Jones, director of Rob Roy and Memphis Belle, whose latest film Urban Hymn had its UK premiere at the Glasgow Film Festival this weekend, is not convinced. \\"I think it's a red herring,\\" to be honest, he said. \\"It would be useful to someone who owns a studio. Will it make a business? I'm not so sure, just an aspect of the business. \\"Film follows money is the tenet. In my time, I have seen the Irish film industry become popular because of tax credits, the Australian, Czech, Hungarian. All of these places made it financially attractive and viable.\\" He added: \\"A studio is four walls. It needs to be fed. It doesn't make an industry. When I made Rob Roy we simply needed a big building. \\"We ended up using a distillery warehouse in Fort William and a shed in Perth. It didn't stop us coming because what we wanted was the exteriors and that's what's unique to Scotland.

Given the following context: The industrial complex covers about 100 acres (40 ha) on both sides of Quehanna Highway at the southeast edge of the Quehanna Wild Area. Although the industrial complex lies within the historic 16-sided polygon, it is no longer part of the wild area. After Curtiss-Wright's lease ended and it donated six of the eight buildings in the complex to the state in 1963, Pennsylvania formed the Commonwealth Industrial Research Corporation to administer and lease the Quehanna facilities, which it did until 1967. Over the years a series of tenants have occupied parts of the industrial complex. One company manufactured logging trailers there from 1967 to 1971, and another processed frozen meat from 1968 to 1970. In 1968 Piper Aircraft established a plant to make metal and plastic parts for airplanes. The complex was renamed from Quehanna to Piper, a name it retains. Piper employed up to 1,000 people, but moved its operations from Pennsylvania to Florida in 1984.The Young Adult Conservation Corps was also based at Piper from 1977 to 1982.

The rationale to choose \\"religion\\" as the answer to your question is based on several reasons: 1. Purpose of mission work: The primary objective of mission workers is to propagate and communicate their religious beliefs and values to others. They strive to introduce people to their specific religious practices and teachings in an effort to expand their faith community. 2. Religious teachings: Mission workers discuss various aspects of their faith, including its history, core beliefs, moral values, and spiritual practices. They share their knowledge and experiences in an effort to guide others on their own spiritual journey and encourage them to embrace their religion. 3. Social and humanitarian work: In addition to spreading their religious beliefs, mission workers often engage in various social and humanitarian activities, such as providing education, medical assistance, and resource development. While these efforts are primarily aimed at improving the overall quality of life for those in need, they also serve as means to demonstrate and promote their faith's values and principles. 4. Personal experiences and testimonials: Mission workers also share their own personal religious experiences, as well as the impact their faith has had on their lives. By offering these testimonials, they aim to inspire and encourage others to explore their religion and potentially adopt it as their own. Based on these factors, it can be concluded that mission workers are constantly telling many people about \\"religion.\\" While mission work might sometimes involve discussions about other topics, such as the importance of learning or the consequences of immoral behavior (such as hellfire), the central focus of their message is, ultimately, about their religious beliefs and practices."},{"prompt":"Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: If a stalactite and stalagmite join together, they form a column .

Brian Schweitzer said Saturday morning that he will not run for Montana's open U.S. Senate seat in 2014, an announcement that complicates Democratic efforts to retain their majority in next year's elections. FILE - This Aug. 30, 2012, file photo, shows Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer in Helena, Mont. Gov. Schweitzer says he will not run for Montana's open U.S. Senate seat in 2014. (AP Photo/Matt Gouras, File) (Associated Press) Schweitzer told The Associated Press that he doesn't want to leave Montana and go to Washington, D.C. He had been considered the Democrats best candidate for holding onto the seat being vacated by U.S. Sen. Max Baucus next year. Schweitzer said he felt compelled to consider the race only because many in his party said they needed him to run. \\"I love Montana. I want to be here. There are all kinds of people that think I ought to be in the United States Senate,\\" Schweitzer said. \\"I never wanted to be in the United States Senate. I kicked the tires. I walked to the edge and looked over.\\" But ultimately, he said, \\"people need to know I am not running for the United States Senate.\\" The former governor was recently elected board chairman of Stillwater Mining Co., Montana's largest publicly trading company and said he is enjoying his life. \\"I have responsibilities here in Montana, my family first. I have taken on a new life at the Stillwater mine. I owe it to the 1,670 people who work at the Stillwater mine that we continue to manage it and make it the best place to work in Montana,\\" Schweitzer said. \\"This is my home, not Washington, D.C.\\" Schweitzer said recent criticism over politically active nonprofits connected to him had no bearing on the decision and said such criticism isn't new. \\"This isn't my first rodeo,\\" Schweitzer said. Montana's open Senate seat is one of several being targeted by Republicans who hope to regain Senate control in the 2014 elections. Republicans need to pick up six seats to win back the majority and enjoy several advantages: the GOP is defending fewer incumbents than Democrats and could benefit from the fact that the party controlling the White House usually loses seats during the midterm election of a second-term president. Democrats need to defend 21 seats, including seven in largely rural states that Republican Mitt Romney carried in 2012. Republicans hope to unseat four key incumbents: Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. The brash, jeans-wearing Schweitzer last year told the AP: \\"I am not goofy enough to be in the House, and I'm not senile enough to be in the Senate.\\" The 57-year-old Democrat left office in January after eight years in office with high approval ratings, but he wasn't able to run again because of term limits. The unconventional governor, who easily won re-election in 2008, always displayed a feel for tapping into Montana's conservative-leaning yet libertarian politics. In Helena, his heavy-handed style proved adept at largely getting his way with the state budget despite fostering a confrontational and sour relationship with majority Republicans. He often touted the state's surpluses at a time when many others were floundering. The outspoken governor never missed an opportunity to leave a larger-than-life impression. He once stormed New York's Times Square with a bullhorn handing out Montana-made promotional trinkets from a semi-truck. But Schweitzer said he is enjoying pursuits other than politics, with a new lake house and a small ranch in the mountains. \\"I don't want a job where I have to wear a suit, and my dog isn't welcome,\\" he said. Other Democrats who expressed an interest in running, including State Auditor Monica Lindeen and schools Superintendent Denise Juneau, had been waiting on Schweitzer's decision. The announcement surprised a Democratic Party that was meeting Saturday in Lewistown for its annual convention, and attention quickly turned to other potential candidates. \\"Democrats were ready to get behind him in a bid for U.S. Senate,\\" said Juneau. \\"Since his announcement, I have been receiving encouragement to run, and I plan to give careful thought to that decision.\\" State Sen. Kendall Van Dyk of Billings, said he understood the decision to spurn a dysfunctional Congress. \\"He chose Montana trout over the rattlesnakes,\\" Van Dyk said. However, he added, Schweitzer \\"has done tremendous things for the state, and any Democrat will tell you he has done tremendous things for the party. Montana needs Brian Schweitzer. And I believe this isn't the last we have heard of him.\\" Republicans are hopeful that freshman U.S. Rep. Steve Daines will run for the open seat. Some Republicans are also advocating former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, who served from 1993 to 2001 and later chaired the Republican National Committee. Daines said Saturday that he will continue to consider the race. \\"My focus is fixed on serving the people of Montana and doing the job they sent me to do,\\" he said in a statement. \\"I will continue to give this decision the consideration it deserves, and am still taking time to talk with my family and the people of Montana about how I can best be of service to our state.\\" As Schweitzer was mulling his options, the Montana Republican Party circulated a 2010 Internal Revenue Service form that showed a politically active nonprofit group called The Council for a Sustainable America used the same Helena post office box used for Schweitzer's 2008 re-election campaign and was signed by David Gallik, the state commissioner of political practices appointed by Schweitzer at the time. The Council for a Sustainable America spent about 60,000 on politics in 2010, but it did not say in which races. Schweitzer adviser Franklin Hall said at the time the nonprofit was never used for Montana politics or to aid Schweitzer. Baucus, 71, announced in April that he was retiring. He was elected to the Senate in 1978 after serving two terms in the House. Baucus, who still controls a healthy campaign war chest, promised Democrats on Saturday he will continue helping them with 2014 elections. \\"Brian was a great governor and there's no question he would have made an excellent candidate,\\" Baucus said in a statement. \\"But we still have a wide field of qualified Montana Democrats who can run and win this seat.\\" ||||| Former Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer’s surprise announcement Saturday that he won’t run for Senate in Montana imperils Democrats’ chances of holding the seat and could further narrow an ever-shrinking 2014 Senate map. Already, Republicans are favored to win two seats left vacant by Democratic retirements — in West Virginia and South Dakota — and the Schweitzer move will make it much easier for the GOP to win in Montana. Text Size - + reset That means the battle for the majority will likely be fought in a handful of red states with Democratic incumbents, including North Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana and Alaska. (PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014) To capture the net six seats it needs to take back the majority in 2014, the GOP will also have to successfully defend Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky and avoid a bloody primary in Georgia that could give Democrats an opening in the red state. Schweitzer roiled the Senate landscape when he told the Associated Press Saturday that he wants to stay in Montana rather than move to Washington, D.C. But his potential candidacy was also raising red flags within the party: After weeks of courting the 57-year-old Schweitzer, Democratic leaders reversed course in recent days. Scrutinizing Schweitzer’s past, they concluded there was too much ammunition for Republicans to use against him in the campaign to replace the retiring veteran Democrat Max Baucus, according to a source familiar with the thinking of those leaders. Polls had shown the gregarious and folksy ex-governor as a favorite in the race, given his popularity after two terms in office. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had said as recently as Wednesday there would be “tremendous support” for Schweitzer if he decided to run. Schweitzer had been hit with a series of damaging stories about his ties to “secret money” and a nonprofit group run by former aides. But sources said the laundry list of opposition research went much deeper — and could have crippled a Schweitzer campaign for Senate. Moreover, there was fear that Schweitzer’s penchant for off-the-cuff remarks would hurt his ability to respond effectively to the barrage of GOP attacks. Schweitzer ended a long Republican run of control of the governor’s office when he was first elected in 2004. But he frequently sparred with fellow top Democrats in the state, including Baucus and Sen. Jon Tester. Unease within the party about Schweitzer’s presumed candidacy had begun to surface in recent days. Still, Schweitzer would have very formidable, forcing both parties to spend millions in what could have been a closely contested fight. In Montana, Democrats said Saturday they still had a chance and there were other possible Democratic candidates who could give Republicans a serious run. Those potential Democratic candidates include Denise Juneau, Montana’s state public schools superintendent; Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily’s List; and Monica Lindeen, Montana insurance commissioner. “Running for the U.S. Senate is a big decision for a potential candidate and their family. Just because this year wasn’t the right time for Brian to run doesn’t mean we don’t have great Montana Democrats who are willing to run and capable of winning the seat,” Tester said in a statement. And Republicans could have their own tough primary in Montana. It remains to be seen how the Republican primary shapes up — and whether Rep. Steve Daines decides to jump in against former state Sen. Corey Stapleton and state Rep. Champ Edmunds. Nevertheless, Schweitzer’s move is expected to stun the Democratic political establishment — particular in Montana, where the party was gathering this weekend for the state convention in Lewistown, Mont. His decision will also disappoint the left, which embraced the populist governor when he backed a liberal health care overhaul plan in 2009 as Baucus played dealmaker in the Senate. And his decision to forgo the campaign will leave Democrats without their biggest name — and personality — in the race. “We remain confident that Democrats can hold the Montana seat and the overall math still favors Democrats next year,” Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a statement. “Only three Democratic incumbents have lost reelection in the last decade. Our incumbents are positioned to win, we’ve already recruited a strong challenger to Mitch McConnell and Republicans have failed to expand the senate map into blue and purple states.” Republicans, of course, had a different take. “Just two days ago, Senate Democrats were quoted promising Brian Schweitzer tremendous resources to get in the race,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Brad Dayspring. “We did our homework and there was a lot of rust under Schweitzer’s hood, but just as important is that he looked at the race and realized he wouldn’t win in light of how unpopular the Democrat agenda of higher taxes, bankrupting spending, and the Obamacare train wreck is in Montana these days.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Former Montana Governor, Brian Schweitzer, has decided not to run for the U.S. Sentae seat left vacant by retiring senator Max Baucus in the 2014 elections.

Schweitzer's decision has put immense pressure on the Democratic Party, as they now need to defend 21 seats in the upcoming elections, including seven in rural states that were previously won by Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. Their aim to retain the majority has now become more challenging as Schweitzer was considered a strong candidate due to his popularity and unconventional approach to politics.

Belushi and Lovitz are so likable and identifiable with the common man that you can't help but get involved once you start watching. The movie has a wonderful cast of stars, some already were big, and others were just getting started. It's billed as a feel good movie, and that's exactly what it is. This movie teaches you that life isn't always so bad after all. Sometimes you've just gotta look at stuff in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you're done watching, you'll appreciate the things you have a lot more and you'll also be smiling.

Based on the sentence \\"A man in a plaid suit playing guitar with a woman and another man.\\", is the sentence \\"A man is playing a song he wrote for his friends.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Based on the sentence \\"A man in a plaid suit playing guitar with a woman and another man,\\" we can infer some information, but we cannot conclusively determine whether the sentence \\"A man is playing a song he wrote for his friends\\" is true or not. Let us analyze both sentences in more detail to elaborate on this point. The original sentence provides the following information: 1. There is a man wearing a plaid suit. 2. This man is playing guitar. 3. He is playing with a woman and another man (most likely implying some form of a musical collaboration). However, it does not provide any information about the relationships between these individuals or the nature of the song being played. We do not know if the individuals mentioned are friends or strangers, or whether the song played is one that the man in the plaid suit wrote himself or not. The second sentence claims that: 1. A man is playing a song. 2. He wrote the song himself. 3. He wrote it specifically for his friends. Although it is possible that the man in the plaid suit in the original sentence could be playing a song he wrote for his friends, there is no concrete information provided to confirm this. The second sentence introduces new elements that are not explicitly present in the original sentence, such as who the song was written by and what the relationship is between the people involved. In conclusion, we cannot definitively say that the sentence \\"A man is playing a song he wrote for his friends\\" is true based solely on the information provided by the original sentence. Further details about the relationships between the individuals and the origins of the song would be required to make that determination."},{"prompt":"Question: Mrs Brown goes to see her son in London .

Review: There is a lot to like about the Palm TX: light, small, reasonably fast, lots of available accessories, and simple interface. There is a lot to dislike too, but my main problem is that Palm DOES NOT support Media Center Edition of Windows XP. If you use Media Center Edition, you will NOT be able to sync your TX with Outlook and your syncs to Palm Desktop WILL be unreliable. What's personally infuriating is the amount of time it took for me to find this out. It took me a long time and many hours of troubleshooting - via suggestions from the Palm Website - to realize the incompatibility. I only found out when I called Palm Tech support (toll call too!). Palm should be upfront that this will not work with MCE. Be sure that the operating system you use is compatible before you buy!* I tried to e-mail Palm several times since the phone call that figured out this problem. No response.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) is a lawyer in the quiet town of New Essex, North Carolina. Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. Cady next approaches Danielle at her school by impersonating her new drama teacher and kisses her. Bowden warns him to leave his family and him alone or suffer the consequences. Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden. Cady's new lawyer, Lee Heller (Gregory Peck), files a complaint with the North Carolina State Bar, vowing to have Bowden disbarred. Kersek reasons that Cady may try... The answer is:","completion":"What events lead to Max Cady seeking revenge on Sam Bowden and his family, and how do their encounters escalate throughout the movie?"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - A double album (or double record) is an audio album which spans two units of the primary medium in which it is sold, typically records and compact discs. A double album is usually though not always released as such, because the recording is longer than the capacity of the medium. Recording artists often think of double albums as comprising a single piece artistically; however, there are exceptions such as John Lennon's \\"Some Time in New York City\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Ummagumma\\" (both examples of one studio record and one live album packaged together) and OutKast's \\"Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\\" (effectively two solo albums, one by each member of the duo). A classic example of this idea is Works (Volume One) by Emerson Lake and Palmer, where side one was Keith Emerson, two Greg Lake, three Carl Palmer while side four was by the entire group. - Stop the Clocks is a compilation album by the English rock band Oasis, released on 20 November 2006. The \\"retrospective collection\\" is an 18-track double album with the featured songs chosen by Noel Gallagher; however, it does not actually include their song \\"Stop the Clocks\\" after which the album is named. It went 5× Platinum in the United Kingdom, with sales better than any Oasis release since \\"Be Here Now\\". - Noel Thomas David Gallagher (born 29 May 1967) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and guitarist. He served as the lead guitarist, co-lead vocalist and principal songwriter of the rock band Oasis. Raised in Burnage, Manchester, Gallagher began learning guitar at the age of thirteen. After a series of odd jobs in construction, he worked for local Manchester band Inspiral Carpets as a roadie and technician in 1988. Whilst touring with them, he learned that his brother Liam Gallagher had formed a band of his own, known as The Rain, which eventually took on the name Oasis. After Gallagher returned to England, he was invited by his brother to join Oasis as songwriter and guitarist. - The Masterplan is a compilation album by the English rock band Oasis , comprising B - sides which never made it onto an album . The album was originally intended for release only in areas such as the United States and Japan , where the tracks were only available on expensive European import singles . It was first released in late 1998 . The Masterplan reached number 2 in the UK where it went platinum , and number 51 in the United States .

Technicians are skilled professionals, and their work may involve fixing, assembling, or maintaining various systems. The term \\"underground\\" in this context refers to the physical location of the work, indicating that it is occurring below ground level. Based on this information, we can deduce that \\"People work underground\\" is a valid conclusion. The technicians in the given statement are indeed people, and they are involved in labor-intensive activities or work beneath the surface of the ground. So, option (1) yes is the most accurate answer. Various industries require skilled technicians to work in underground environments. Some examples are mining, tunnel construction, subway or metro transportation facilities, underground cable installation, and maintenance of sewer systems. Working underground may confront individuals with unique challenges, such as confined spaces, lack of natural sunlight, damp or hazardous conditions, or difficulties in communication and transport.

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

However, upon receiving them, she found the documentation stating that the inserts should be used in conjunction with a 1,200-calorie-per-day diet. With or without the inserts, a 1,200 calorie diet is likely to result in weight loss. This incident led her to realize she had been a victim of a scam.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: What did the actor do for a living after getting rejected for the play with the even larger theatre?

Q: Q: Blood calcium levels are tightly regulated by the what system? A: Options: 1. digestive 2. cardiovascular 3. nervous 4. endocrine The answer is:","completion":"In order to find the correct answer, let us consider each option and its relation to blood calcium levels: 1. Digestive System: This system is responsible for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients, but it does not directly regulate blood calcium levels. 2. Cardiovascular System: This system's primary function is to circulate blood and transport nutrients, oxygen, and waste products throughout the body. While it is essential for the distribution of calcium, it does not actively regulate blood calcium levels. 3. Nervous System: This system is responsible for transmitting signals between different parts of the body, coordinating body functions, and interpreting sensory input. Although the nervous system requires calcium for proper function, it does not directly regulate blood calcium levels. 4. Endocrine System: This system comprises glands that produce and secrete hormones, which regulate many aspects of body function, including growth, metabolism, and homeostasis. Certain hormones, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin, directly regulate blood calcium levels by maintaining a balance between the bone, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.

Please answer the following question: Information: - In information theory , Shannon 's source coding theorem ( or noiseless coding theorem ) establishes the limits to possible data compression , and the operational meaning of the Shannon entropy . The source coding theorem shows that ( in the limit , as the length of a stream of independent and identically - distributed random variable ( i.i.d . ) data tends to infinity ) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate ( average number of bits per symbol ) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source , without it being virtually certain that information will be lost . However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy , with negligible probability of loss . The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word ( which is viewed as a random variable ) and of the size of the target alphabet . - Ecology (from , \\"house\\", or \\"environment\\"; -, \\"study of\\") is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes the study of interactions organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services. - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968. - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton. - The Boltzmann constant (or ), which is named after Ludwig Boltzmann, is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant divided by the Avogadro constant : - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding. - A temperature is an objective comparative measurement of hot or cold. It is measured by a thermometer. Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called \\"centigrade\\"), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K). - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humancomputer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation. - In statistical thermodynamics, entropy (usual symbol ) (Greek:, + ) is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations that a thermodynamic system can have when in a state as specified by certain macroscopic variables. Specifically, assuming that each of the microscopic configurations is equally probable, the entropy of the system is the natural logarithm of that number of configurations, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant (which provides consistency with the original thermodynamic concept of entropy discussed below, and gives entropy the dimension of energy divided by temperature). Formally, - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. - In data mining, anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. - Signal processing is an enabling technology that encompasses the fundamental theory, applications, algorithms, and implementations of processing or transferring information contained in many different physical, symbolic, or abstract formats broadly designated as \\"signals\\". It uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and linguistic representations, formalisms, and techniques for representation, modelling, analysis, synthesis, discovery, recovery, sensing, acquisition, extraction, learning, security, or forensics. - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.

No; The suggested answer provided touches upon the quality of service comparison between the United States and Canada, but it does not specifically address the question regarding Canada's healthcare system. Additionally, the source of the study mentioned is not provided, making it impossible to verify the legitimacy of the data. To provide a more appropriate and detailed answer, let's focus on how Canada's healthcare system operates: Canada's healthcare system, known as Medicare, is a publicly-funded, universal healthcare system that provides its citizens with access to essential medical services by doctors, specialists, and hospitals. This system operates under the guidance of the Canada Health Act, with each province and territory administering their own healthcare plans. Canada's healthcare system is funded primarily through general tax revenue collected by both federal and provincial governments. This means that Canadian residents receive coverage for necessary medical services without having to pay out-of-pocket. However, healthcare services in Canada generally do not cover services such as dental care, prescription medications, and vision care. Many Canadians also opt to purchase additional supplementary private insurance to cover these services. One of the main goals of the Canadian healthcare system is to ensure that all citizens have universal access to care, regardless of their financial status. This is achieved through the principles of universality, comprehensiveness, portability, accessibility, and public administration. However, in terms of responsiveness or quality of service, there are some critiques of the Canadian healthcare system, including long wait times for non-emergency services and the availability of specialists. In conclusion, the suggested answer does not provide an accurate and complete description of Canada's healthcare system. Instead, it is important to delve into how the system functions, its funding, objectives, and the challenges faced in providing quality care to all citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The missing first step in this process is: \\"The adult birds engage in courtship rituals and establish a breeding territory.\\" So, the revised and complete process is as follows: 1. The adult birds engage in courtship rituals and establish a breeding territory. 2. The adult birds find mates and mate. 3. The parent(s) incubate the eggs. 4. The eggs hatch. 5. The mother (and sometimes the father) bird take care of the baby birds. 6. The baby birds grow up and get their flight feathers. 7. The young birds learn to fly and leave the nest. Throughout this process, various aspects of breeding in birds can be observed depending on the species. Courtship rituals, also known as mating displays, are performed by birds to attract a suitable mate. These elaborate behaviors include singing, dancing, and the presentation of brightly colored plumage or body parts. Once a pair has formed through successful courtship, the birds will then establish a breeding territory to ensure their offspring will have access to adequate resources for growth and development. In the next step, the mated pair proceed with copulation which leads to fertilization of the eggs. Following fertilization, the female bird will lay the eggs in their nest, which is often intricately crafted to provide the perfect environment for incubation. During the incubation period, the parent birds work together to protect and provide warmth to their eggs, ensuring a stable temperature for successful embryonic development to take place. Upon hatching, the helpless and vulnerable baby birds, also known as nestlings or hatchlings, rely entirely on their parents for warmth, protection, and nutrition. As the baby birds grow, they develop feathers necessary for insulation, camouflage, and ultimately flight. This phase, known as the fledgling stage, occurs when the young birds begin to test their wings and eventually leave the nest to become independent. Throughout the entire breeding process, various factors, such as availability of resources, predation, and environmental conditions, can influence the success rate of producing and raising offspring. Nevertheless, these seven key steps in the breeding cycle of birds are vital for the continuation of bird populations and the vital ecological services they provide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: One day, Soapy Smith and I visited a shelter for badly-treated women located in a deserted section of the city. No one smiled a greeting, and they appeared uninterested in Soapy. One little girl in particular moved like a wisp in the background. The staff informed me that she had been there for over a month and had not spoken the entire time. Her mother said she had talked at one time but not in recent memory. I didn't want to imagine what could have happened to rob this little girl of the natural curiosity and enthusiasm so natural to childhood. Spreading a blanket on the floor, I sat down and put Soapy on the blanket. As the silent child circled past me, I told the group that Soapy would come to talk to them if they sat on his blanket. Several children did this, including the silent girl. She sat rigidly at the edge of the blanket, legs held stiffly out straight in front of her. She was staring hard at Soapy. It appeared that he kept making eye contact with her. She didn't reach out to him or encourage him in any way. Rather she sat tensely, just staring. Finally Soapy came to a stop about two inches from her. He quietly reached out and laid his chin on her knee. I was astonished. While a common behavior for dogs, this is not a behavior exhibited by rabbits, especially not by this rabbit. The child did not reach out to touch Soapy. Instead, she slowly leaned toward him. When her face was within inches of his, she carefully reached out and circled him with her arms. So softly that no one in the room could hear, she began to talk. Folded around the rabbit, she pillowed her head on his back and whispered to him. Soapy remained motionless. I looked up and noticed that the shelter workers had stopped talking. Every adult in the room froze in place. Time seemed to have stopped. The little girl reappeared when I was preparing to leave. She reached her hands out and looked me directly in the eye.

Yes or no, is the answer \\"she had too much hard experience\\"? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, it can be inferred that the little girl did not speak any word because she had experienced some form of trauma or difficult experiences in her life. This seems evident as the staff mentioned that she had talked at one time but not in recent memory, and the article describes the shelter as a place for badly-treated women. While this cannot be confirmed with certainty, it is reasonable to deduce that the silence of the little girl is likely due to some hard experiences she has endured. So, the answer to the question - \\"she had too much hard experience\\" - would be a \\"Yes.\\" It is essential to keep in mind that understanding the full context and the reason behind her silence requires more information and a deeper understanding of her circumstances.

Justin wants to learn how to flip a pancake so he asks Robert for an advice, because Choose from: a). Justin is a beginner.; b). Robert is a beginner.;","completion":"a). Justin is a beginner. Justin has always loved eating pancakes but never actually tried making them from scratch. He had heard that his friend Robert make delicious pancakes, so he decided to ask him for some advice. Since Justin is a beginner at cooking, he thought Robert could give him some helpful tips. On a sunny Saturday morning, Justin called Robert and invited him to his place. \\"Hey Robert, could you come over and teach me how to flip a pancake? I really want to learn, and I heard that you are an expert at making them!\\" Robert laughed at the 'expert' title but agreed to help his friend out. When Robert arrived, he found Justin in the kitchen, apron on and ingredients neatly laid out on the counter. He was eager to learn, yet a little apprehensive about making something that required a particular skill such as flipping. Robert reassured him that it's not as hard as it looks, and they began working through the process step by step. First, they mixed the dry ingredients such as flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. In another bowl, they combined the wet ingredients which included milk, eggs, and melted butter. Robert advised Justin that it's best to make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and then gradually add the wet ingredients while whisking. This would ensure a smooth, lump-free batter. Once they achieved the right consistency, Robert showed Justin how to heat the non-stick pan properly. \\"Remember, a well-heated pan is essential for making perfectly flipped pancakes. If it's too cold, the batter will stick, making it difficult to flip,\\" he explained. As the pan reached the desired temperature, Robert showed Justin how to ladle the batter into the pan. He advised pouring the batter from a small height and letting it spread out evenly on its own. \\"Don't overcrowd the pan,\\" Robert warned. \\"Give the pancake space to grow.\\" Justin was growing more confident as he watched the pancake cooking on the first side. The edges were starting to firm up, and small bubbles were forming on the surface. \\"It's time for the flip!\\" exclaimed Robert with excitement. \\"Here's the part where your wrist comes into play.\\" Robert demonstrated the pancake flip to Justin. He loosened the edges of the pancake with a spatula and then, with a flick of his wrist, flipped the pancake in the air. The pancake made a graceful arc and landed perfectly back in the pan. Justin watched in awe, excited to try it for himself. Taking a deep breath, Justin attempted his first flip. The pancake went airborne, but it didn't land quite as effortlessly as Robert's. However, it was still a decent attempt for a first-timer. Justin was thrilled with his progress and asked Robert to critique his technique so he could improve. Over the next few pancakes, Justin practiced and began mastering the flip. Robert continued to provide support and pointers whenever needed. By the time they finished making the pancakes, Justin was flipping them with ease, his confidence soaring. The friends enjoyed the fruits of their labor, devouring stacks of delicious homemade pancakes topped with melted butter and maple syrup. They laughed and talked about their fun-filled morning, and Justin expressed his gratitude to Robert for teaching him a new skill. \\"Thanks, Robert! I couldn't have done it without you!\\" From that day on, Justin continued to hone his pancake-flipping skills and even dabble in variations like blueberry and chocolate chip pancakes. He was no longer a beginner but a pancake enthusiast, all thanks to his friend Robert's guidance and patience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

How likely is that to be threatening? I am in my pre-final year in ECE engineering. What all knowledge do I need as to have an edge during placements?","completion":"No, these two questions are not the same. They address different subjects, and their focus is distinct. While the first question pertains to the environment and our understanding of climate change, the second question is career-oriented, focusing on electronic and communication engineering (ECE). Let's explore both of these questions in more detail. Question 1: \\"Climate scientists have posited the possibility of a run-away greenhouse effect. How likely is that to be threatening?\\" This question revolves around the field of environmental science, specifically focusing on the concept of a runaway greenhouse effect. A runaway greenhouse effect occurs when a planet absorbs more solar radiation than it can dissipate, leading to a continuous increase in temperature until an equilibrium is reached. This has been hypothesized as a possible scenario for Venus's current adverse climate conditions. The likelihood of the Earth experiencing a runaway greenhouse effect is still a subject of debate among climate scientists. While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has not mentioned a runaway greenhouse effect event in their future predictions, there are concerns that amplifying feedback loops, such as the release of methane from melting permafrost, increased water vapor, and forest dieback, might accelerate climate change beyond current projections. However, most researchers believe that we are not yet at the point where a runaway greenhouse effect is imminent. Preventing this outcome will require substantial global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and follow other mitigation strategies. The longer we delay taking action, the higher the risk of destabilizing the climate system and experiencing more severe consequences of climate change. Question 2: \\"I am in my pre-final year in ECE engineering. What all knowledge do I need to have an edge during placements?\\" This question concerns career preparation, specifically for students in the field of Electronic and Communication Engineering (ECE). ECE is a rapidly evolving field, with numerous job opportunities in industries like consumer electronics, telecommunications, aerospace, IoT, automotive, and many others. To excel in ECE and improve your chances of securing successful placements during job interviews, consider acquiring the following knowledge and skills: 1. Fundamentals: Have a solid grasp of core ECE subjects like digital electronics, analog electronics, control systems, microprocessors, signals and systems, electromagnetic theory, and communication systems. 2. Programming languages: Familiarize yourself with programming languages relevant to the ECE field, such as C, C++, Python, and VHDL/Verilog for hardware description. 3. Practical experience: Engage in hands-on projects, internships, or research to apply your theoretical knowledge practically. This demonstrates to potential employers that you are capable of working in real-world situations. 4. Software tools: Learn to use software tools that are related to ECE, such as circuit simulators (e.g., LTspice, Multisim), PCB design tools (e.g., Eagle, KiCad), and MATLAB. 5. Specialization: Focus on an area of ECE that interests you or in-demand specializations, such as embedded systems, communication networks, Internet of Things, VLSI design, robotics, or machine learning and artificial intelligence. 6. Soft skills: Develop skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, teamwork, time management, and effective communication, as these are essential in any engineering field. 7. Networking: Participate in technical clubs, workshops, conferences, and professional networking platforms to build connections and stay informed about industry trends and opportunities. 8. Certifications: Pursue relevant certifications or courses that complement your ECE degree, such as those related to networking (e.g., CCNA, CCNP), programming, or other advanced technologies and platforms. By focusing on these areas, you can build a strong foundation and enhance your competitive edge during placement opportunities in the ECE field."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Aaliyah began recording the album in 1998. She recorded a few songs, including two with longtime collaborator Timbaland, before working on Romeo Must Die. In 1999, while working on the record in New York City, Aaliyah called and asked Trent Reznor, one of her musical idols, to produce a song, but they could not coordinate their schedules. She intended to finish the album by the end of 2000 and resumed its recording while filming in Australia for Queen of the Damned (2002), as she shot her part for the film during the day and recorded songs at night. She said in an interview for Billboard, \\"there were nights when I didn't go into the studio—I was too tired.

Please answer the following question: when does Plum Island Light built which has the same design as Great Captain Island Lighthouse? A:","completion":"Plum Island Lighthouse, which shares the same design as Great Captain Island Lighthouse, was built in 1869. Plum Island Lighthouse, also known as Plum Island Range Rear Light, is located on Plum Island, near the western end of Long Island Sound in New York, United States. The lighthouse was constructed as part of the lighting system established to guide mariners through Plum Gut, a narrow passage off the eastern tip of Long Island that connected to Gardiners Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The lighthouse features a cast-iron and brick tower that is 55 feet tall, octagonal in shape, and painted white to improve its visibility. This particular design was a result of efforts by the United States Lighthouse Board in the mid-19th century to standardize the construction of lighthouses by using prefabricated cast-iron components. Cast-iron structures were not only more economical but also more durable against harsh coastal weather conditions. Great Captain Island Lighthouse is located on Great Captain Island, off the coast of Greenwich, Connecticut. This lighthouse also features the same octagonal cast-iron design. Great Captain Island Lighthouse's construction was completed in 1868, just a year before Plum Island Lighthouse. Although both lighthouses were built around the same time and used similar designs, they served different purposes. While Plum Island Light helped mariners navigate through Plum Gut, Great Captain Island Lighthouse provided guidance for vessels approaching the ports of Stamford and Greenwich in Connecticut, as well as New York City. Over the years, both lighthouses underwent renovations and technology upgrades, and the structures that exist today still serve to aid navigation in their respective regions. However, while Plum Island Lighthouse was deactivated in 1978 and replaced by an automatic light on a skeleton tower, Great Captain Island Lighthouse continues to operate, having been automated in 1970. Both lighthouses now reflect the rich maritime history and the evolving technology of their times."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Revolutionizing the field of communication and information dissemination, the printing press played a crucial role in shaping the modern world. This article aims to explore the origin, development, and impact of the Gutenberg printing press, shedding light on its significance in shaping human history. The Origin of the Gutenberg Printing Press Johannes Gutenberg, born in Mainz, Germany, around 1400, was a goldsmith by trade. The idea of a printing press came to him while working on a project commissioned by the Church to create multiple copies of religious texts. Recognizing the limitations of the existing method of copying texts manually by scribes, Gutenberg sought a more efficient and cost-effective alternative. His inspiration stemmed from his experience as a goldsmith, where he utilized molds and metal alloys to create various products. Development of the Printing Press Gutenberg's groundbreaking idea was to use movable type to create individual characters that could be rearranged and reused to form new words and sentences. He crafted a matrix with holes that held metal pins, corresponding to each letter of the alphabet, and used these pins to create molds in which he poured molten metal. The resulting metal type could then be assembled into words, sentences, and paragraphs on a wooden frame called a forme. Gutenberg combined his invention of movable type with a modified version of the existing screw press, which was traditionally used for pressing grapes or olives. By fitting the press with a wooden platen, he was able to apply continuous pressure on the paper and inked type, ensuring a clean and even transfer of ink to paper. This innovative adaptation allowed the efficient and precise production of multiple copies of text with ease and speed. The Printing of the Gutenberg Bible In 1455, Gutenberg's invention reached a significant milestone with the completion of the 42-line Gutenberg Bible, also known as the Mazarin Bible. This Latin Bible consisted of 1,282 pages and is considered a masterpiece of typography and craftsmanship. The Gutenberg Bible demonstrated the potential of the printing press to transform the way people accessed and shared written information. It marked a shift in the history of book production from laborious and costly handwritten texts to mass-produced and easily accessible printed works. Impact of the Gutenberg Printing Press The Gutenberg printing press's most significant impact was in revolutionizing the accessibility and dissemination of knowledge, transforming the way society functioned. Some of the key areas influenced by the invention of the printing press include: 1. Education and Literacy: As books became more affordable and widely accessible, the demand for literacy grew, leading to an increase in education across social classes. The readily available printed materials allowed for greater self-study and facilitated learning outside of formal education institutions. 2. Religion and the Reformation: The printing press made it possible to print religious texts in large quantities and in local languages. This helped to spread religious ideas, giving rise to the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century. For the first time, the wider public could read, interpret and discuss religious texts for themselves, challenging the authority of the Catholic Church. 3. Scientific Revolution: The ability to easily share and reproduce scientific findings and theories allowed researchers to build upon the work of their predecessors, accelerating the growth of scientific knowledge. Consequently, the 16th and 17th centuries witnessed an explosion of new ideas and inventions in various fields such as astronomy, mathematics, and physics. 4. The Birth of Mass Media: The printing press facilitated the emergence of newspapers, pamphlets, and flyers. This development allowed for greater participation by the general public in intellectual debates, political discussions, and the spread of news – giving birth to the concept of mass media and the modern communication systems we rely on today. Conclusion The invention of the Gutenberg printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 1440s marked the beginning of a new era in human history. By revolutionizing the production and dissemination of written information, this remarkable invention played a crucial role in shaping the world's modern landscape. The Gutenberg printing press accelerated the growth of literacy, education, scientific innovation, religious reform, and mass communication – all of which continue to shape our lives today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frank Chambers a drifter, stops at a depression-era rural California diner for a meal and ends up working there. The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on one another, he tries only Cora for the crime. Although they turn against each other, a clever ploy from Cora's lawyer, Katz, prevents Cora's full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor. With the tactic having failed to generate any new evidence for the prosecution, Cora benefits from a deal in which she pleads guilty to manslaughter and is sentenced to probation. Months later, Frank has an affair with Madge Gorland while Cora is out of town. When Cora returns, she tells Frank she is pregnant.

Justification: Paper plates are affordable and easily accessible. Step 2: Place a paper plate between each antique china plate or fine dinnerware. Justification: Paper plates have a soft surface that will serve as a cushion, preventing scratches and damage between the china plates. Step 3: Store the stacked plates in a safe and stable environment. Justification: A stable environment reduces the risk of accidental falls or impacts, ensuring the well-being of the antique china. 2. Protect your antique china plates or fine dinnerware from scratches by placing an inexpensive glass plate between them when storing. Step 1: Acquire inexpensive glass plates. Justification: Glass plates may not be as easily accessible as paper plates but can still be found without much difficulty. Step 2: Place a glass plate between each antique china plate or fine dinnerware.

He was said to be a great warrior and expanded his kingdom during his rule. - The Mahabharata or Mahbhrata (US ; UK \\"\\") is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the \\"Ramayana\\". - In Indian epic poetry, Vasudeva (Devanagari , IAST \\") is the father of Krishna. He was the brother of cowherds tribe chieftain Nanda Baba who was a Surasena who was foster father of Lord Krishna. His sister Kunti was married to Pandu. Kunti plays a big role later in the war Mahabharata. Vasudeva was a partial incarnation of Rishi Kashyapa. The patronymic \\" (with long \\"\\") is a popular name of Krishna. According to the Harivansa Purana, Vasudeva and Nanda were brothers. - Hindu Mythology is large figure of mythical narratives in Hinduism found in Hindu texts such as the epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana, Ancient Tamil literature (such as the Sangam literature and Periya Puranam), several other regional literature of South Asia. As such, it is a subset of mainstream Indian and Nepali culture. Rather than one consistent, monolithic structure, the same myth appears in various versions, varies with diverse traditions, developed by different sects, people and philosophical schools, in different regions and at different times, which are not necessarily held by all Hindus to be literal accounts of historical events, but are taken to have deeper, often symbolic, meaning, and which have been given a complex range of interpretations. - The Ramayana (\\"\\") is an ancient Indian epic poem which narrates the struggle of the divine prince Rama to rescue his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana.

WePay, a Website that helps people collect, manage and spend money online, has analysed tons of research, reports and surveys from different sources, and the results were surprising! Are Gift Cards a Good Idea? Rather than give someone a gift that they might not like, it's better just to pick up a gift card so they can buy what they really want, right? Wrong. This year, 2.5 billion in gift cards went unspent. Of that amount, 1.3 billion went unspent because people didn't bother making the time. Another I billion or so was forgotten altogether. How Much Do We Really Value the Gifts We're Given? The lucky recipient of a gift, like a cashmere sweater, will value it less than the amount it was purchased for. And ladies, contrary to what you might think, place less monetary value on the diamond ring they are given than the guys who have bought it for them. What Happens to Our Gifts After They're Given? Many complain that the holiday season means shopping and crazily spending money, but studies show that once the big day arrives, we are less focused on gifts than we think.

The Ozarks in Missouri, and the more massive and younger Colorado Rockies. He loved both ranges, but liked the caves systems and blue holes in the Ozarks a bit more. Which rocks are less soluble, the ones from the Ozarks, or the ones from the Rockies? Answer:","completion":"To determine which rocks are less soluble between the ones from the Ozarks in Missouri and the ones from the Colorado Rockies, it's essential first to understand the geology and composition of the rocks in these mountain ranges. The Ozarks, a high plateau region also known as the Ozark Plateau, extends over parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. This area is characterized mainly by the presence of limestone, dolomite, and chert, which were formed from the deposition of marine sediments during the Paleozoic Era (approximately 541 to 252 million years ago). Limestone and dolomite are composed predominantly of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate) and are hence susceptible to dissolution in the presence of weak acids, such as carbonic acid found in rainwater. This process of dissolution leads to the formation of the caves, sinkholes, and blue holes that Peter loved so much. The dissolved calcite precipitates overtime, forming speleothems like stalactites, stalagmites, and flowstones in underground caverns. On the other hand, the Colorado Rockies, or Rocky Mountains, is a vast and imposing mountain range that stretches about 3,000 miles from northern British Columbia in Canada to New Mexico in the United States. The Rockies are younger than the Ozarks, having formed about 80 million years ago during the Laramide Orogeny, a period of intense mountain-building activity due to the tectonic collision between the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate. Consequently, the rock composition of the Colorado Rockies is quite different from the Ozarks, with a dominant presence of igneous (granite and basalt) and metamorphic rocks (gneiss, schist, and marble). These rock types, especially the igneous and metamorphic ones, are typically more resistant to weathering and dissolution than the sedimentary rocks like limestone. When comparing the solubility of rocks from the Ozarks and the Colorado Rockies, the sedimentary rocks (limestone and dolomite) found in the Ozarks are more soluble due in large part to their calcite content, which reacts with weak acids present in the natural environment. In contrast, the rocks from the Colorado Rockies, primarily the igneous and metamorphic types, demonstrate reduced solubility and resistance to dissolution and weathering. In conclusion, the rocks from the Colorado Rockies are less soluble than the ones from the Ozarks, owing to their distinct geological history and resultant compositions. The Ozarks' susceptibility to dissolution results in the awe-inspiring cave systems and blue holes that Peter particularly enjoyed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Bobby Jindal told members of his political party Tuesday night. Gov. Bobby Jindal is offering a spirited defense of Republicans who say they want President Obama to fail. Jindal described the premise of the question -- \\"Do you want the president to fail?\\" -- as the \\"latest gotcha game\\" being perpetrated by Democrats against Republicans. \\"Make no mistake: Anything other than an immediate and compliant, 'Why no sir, I don't want the president to fail,' is treated as some sort of act of treason, civil disobedience or political obstructionism,\\" Jindal said at a political fundraiser attended by 1,200 people. \\"This is political correctness run amok.\\" At 37, OPTIONS: - Bobby Jindal potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - CNN potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - Democrats potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - GOP potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - Jindal potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - Louisiana potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - Obama potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - Republicans potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - U.S. potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. - WASHINGTON potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012.","completion":"Bobby Jindal potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012. As a young and prominent Republican figure, Jindal has been making waves in the political arena, gaining recognition and support among members of his party. Born in 1971 to Indian immigrant parents, Jindal has accomplished a lot in his relatively short political career. He has served in various positions, including as Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and as the Governor of Louisiana from 2008 to 2016. Jindal's leadership during and after Hurricane Katrina showcased his ability to handle crisis situations and make tough decisions on behalf of his constituents. Moreover, Jindal has been an advocate for reducing the size of government and promoting conservative fiscal policies. As a potential 2012 presidential candidate, Jindal could have capitalized on his diverse background and experience in both the legislative and executive branches of government to appeal to a wide range of voters. While he ultimately decided not to run for president in 2012, his name was often mentioned in discussions about potential Republican candidates. Moving forward, Jindal's political career could continue to flourish in various ways. He could seek to return to Congress or explore opportunities at the state level in Louisiana. Additionally, Jindal could potentially be tapped for a position within the Republican administration or be considered for other leadership roles within the party. Jindal's comments defending Republicans who wish for then-President Obama to fail indicate his commitment to his party's values and his willingness to stand up for conservatism. This loyalty and dedication to the GOP will likely continue to serve him well in his future political endeavors. In summary, Bobby Jindal's early accomplishments and steadfast commitment to his party suggest that he has a long political future ahead, regardless of whether he decides to run for president in the future. His diverse background and experience in various government roles serve to strengthen his appeal and make him a valuable asset for the Republican Party. It will be interesting to see how Jindal's political career unfolds and the impact he has on both his party and the American political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer goes on to call the book \\"garbage\\" and compares the author's work to \\"stepping in a pile of dung,\\" which further emphasize the negative sentiments being conveyed. They also recount an unfavorable interaction with the author, which further contributes to the negative perception of the book and his other works.

The sarcasm in the last few lines of the review, where the reviewer refers to David Almond as a great writer and compares it to the bubonic plague being a rash, reiterates how strongly they feel against the book.

What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake.

Desktop: A desktop refers to the primary screen space and the hardware setup of a computer where programs, documents, and applications are managed. While desktop computers can be used to facilitate conference calls, the term itself does not directly refer to the type of call you are on. 2. Headphones: Headphones are an audio device worn on the ears to privately listen to music or other audio content. They can be connected to various devices, such as smartphones, computers, or music players. While headphones may be used during a conference call, they do not define the type of call you are on. 3.

Can my boss fire me because I smell bad? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"No, these questions are not the same. In fact, they address two very separate and distinct issues. Here, I will elaborate on each question and provide a detailed response for each of them. 1. How can I get my lying boss fired without me or my coworkers feeling the repercussions? To achieve this, it is important to follow a careful, systematic approach. The key is to document any incidents, gather evidence, and follow the appropriate chain of communication. Below are some steps to help you work through the situation: a. Keep a detailed record: Make notes on each incident where your boss has lied, including the date, time, people involved, and any relevant context. This documentation will serve as evidence when you present your case to higher management or HR. b. Gather evidence: If there is any physical or digital evidence, such as emails or recorded conversations, that can corroborate your claims, gather and securely store them. c. Speak with your coworkers: Talk to your coworkers to see if they have observed similar behavior from your boss. If possible, ask them to document incidents and share any evidence they may have. Assure them that their identities will be kept confidential, if they wish. d. Understand your company's policies: Familiarize yourself with your company's policies and procedures regarding workplace conduct, ethics, and reporting. This information will guide you on how to best address the issue. e. Report the issue: Follow the appropriate chain of command in your company to report the issue. Ideally, you should be reporting this to either a higher-level manager, an HR representative, or an ethics hotline if your company has one. Be clear, factual, and concise in your communication. f. Remain professional: While reporting the issue, it is important to remain professional and focused on the facts. Avoid personal attacks or making emotional appeals. This will help establish your credibility. g. Protect yourself from retaliation: If you are concerned about possible retaliation, you can request anonymity during your report. You should also familiarize yourself with your company's anti-retaliation policy and any relevant labor laws in case you need to take further action. 2. Can my boss fire me because I smell bad? In general, an employer may be able to terminate an employee due to bad hygiene or offensive odors, assuming these issues are causing disruptions in the workplace and the employer has followed due process. The specific legality of such a termination is more nuanced and depends on various factors, such as employment contracts, local labor laws, and whether the employee has been given a fair chance to improve their hygiene. Here's a more detailed breakdown: a. Check your employment contract: If your employment contract stipulates that an employee can be terminated for poor hygiene or any specific causes, your boss may have grounds to fire you. b. Research local labor laws: Research the labor laws in your area to determine the grounds for termination, ensuring you're aware of your rights and any possible legal recourse. c. Fair warning: Employers are typically expected to provide fair warning and an opportunity to rectify the issue before considering termination. If your boss has identified the problem but has not provided you with an opportunity to improve your hygiene, it could be considered unfair dismissal. d. Discrimination or harassment: Ensure that your boss's actions aren't motivated by unlawful discrimination or harassment. Termination based on personal bias or ill-will could be against the law, depending on your jurisdiction. e. Medical conditions: In some cases, bad odors may be caused by medical conditions. If your smell is caused by a medical condition, you may be protected under disability laws. In this case, termination due to the smell could be considered discriminatory and unlawful.

The incinerated-looking buns are darkened with bamboo charcoal, and the same has been used to give the poisonous-looking cheese its melted-tar look. The beef burgers, meanwhile, have added black pepper, and are topped with an onion and garlic sauce mixed with squid ink. The international chain says it is the third time it has released a goth-like burger (the others had black buns and black ketchup) and diners have so far given them a “favourable reception.” Strange as they seem, however, Burger King’s Kuro Pearl and Kuro Diamond are not the first black burgers around.

These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Rice Energy's Gas Deal Gives OPEC a Black Eye If you want to understand why OPEC is having such a hard time squeezing shale producers out of the energy market, look no further than Rice Energy's multi-dimensional, 2.7 billion acquisition of Vantage Energy. Yes, it's a natural-gas deal, not oil. But that isn't the point. The point is that a deal of this scale, requiring this much new money, for a commodity this beaten down, is getting done at all in the U.S. exploration and production sector. Gas has rallied recently, although 3 per million BTU counts as enough to get a high-five from bulls these days. 3, That's The Magic Number Natural gas prices have rallied, albeit from very low levels Note: Generic 1st-month natural gas futures contract. But the U.S. gas market is a patchwork of regions, with local pricing often markedly different from the benchmark Nymex futures price because of constraints on pipeline capacity. Such is the case in Appalachia, where Rice and Vantage have their core assets: Natural gas prices at the Dominion South Point hub in Pennsylvania have slipped back below 1 So sentiment overall is better than it was but hardly jubilant. Certainly, you might think a gas producer would have some problems going to investors and telling them it wants to raise more money selling new shares than it did at its IPO less than three years ago. But Rice seems to be handling it. To fund the deal, Rice is pulling multiple levers. Its selling almost 1.2 billion of new shares (including the greenshoe), which is more than it raised when the stock debuted in late 2013, according to Bloomberg data. It's issuing roughly another 1 billion to Vantage's private equity owners. All in all, the 85.1 million new shares are equal to a staggering 43 percent of the existing number outstanding. Increase in Rice Energy's Share Count to Fund This Deal In addition, Rice will immediately sell the pipeline assets that come as part of the package to its master limited partnership, Rice Midstream Partners, to cover 600 million of the cost. That money will come from a combination of the MLP using debt and selling new units or just handing some over to Rice. The seemingly endless appetite of U.S. capital markets is what has enabled the country's E&P firms to withstand OPEC's onslaught better than many expected heading into this crash. Despite (and because of) the crash, 2016 is a banner year for U.S. E&P stock offerings Note: Data for 2016 are year-to-date through September 27th. That isn't to say Rice is just riding a wave. It has managed rapid growth while keeping its borrowing in check -- a rare feat these days. Part of this is down to savvy use of futures: Rice's average realized gas price last year was 2.21 per million BTU before hedges but 3.18 -- 44 percent higher -- after. Indeed, one of the attractions of Vantage, other than its main acreage sitting neatly next to Rice's own, is its own hedge book. Roughly two-thirds of pro forma production next year is hedged. Rice's stock has been a star performer this year, despite the company selling another 561 million of stock in April to help fund another deal. The same goes for Rice Midstream, which has trounced the broader MLP sector. Rice's two securities have surged this year Note: Performance indexed to 100. So Rice is taking advantage of investors' generosity -- including Rice Midstream's current cost of equity below 4 percent -- and liquid futures markets to keep expanding. In the process, the deal also offers a way for Vantage's private equity owners to cash out and back into an established, listed stock rather than continue down the path of trying to IPO the company themselves. Is it an option open to everyone? No. Earlier this summer, I noted the club of E&P companies coming to the stock market to raise more money had shrunk somewhat compared to 2015. Equally, though, any company able to claim real estate in the Permian basin seems able to name their price. It's a trend that appears unsustainable if energy prices remain depressed and if interest rates should rise. But it's appeared unsustainable for quite some time already. And now along comes this Rice deal. OPEC may be showing some fatigue in its battle to recover market share. Until it finally beats the capital markets into submission, though, it should soldier on. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning in New York at ldenning1@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.net","completion":"Rice Energy's 2.7bn natural gas acquisition of Vantage Energy highlights the resilience of the US energy exploration and production (E&P) sector. Despite weak oil and gas markets, investors continue to back US E&P firms, who have been even more resilient with regard to the oil crash than many expected. However, the sector will come under increasing pressure if energy prices do not increase and if interest rates rise. The eventual outcome of the crisis will likely depend on which party - US E&P firms or OPEC - can survive for the longest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First of all, while the comparisons to \\"Princess Bride\\" are inevitable, it's almost futile to do so. While both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop, \\"Stardust\\" is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film I've ever seen. It's such a hybrid of those genres, but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances, special effects, cinematography, and score--the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s.

Write an article based on this \\"Asylum seekers in the UK who claim to be torture victims are facing two-year delays to be examined because doctors are \\"overwhelmed\\" by caseloads, a report says.\\"","completion":"Title: Asylum Seekers in the UK: Overburdened System leads to Two-Year Delays for Torture Victims Introduction The United Kingdom has long been a safe haven for asylum seekers escaping conflict, persecution, and human rights abuses from around the world. However, the country's overburdened healthcare system has led to a troubling backlog, severely impacting the lives and well-being of those desperately in need of help and support. As the government struggles to allocate resources to address the demand, recent reports have revealed a shocking situation: asylum seekers who claim to be victims of torture are now facing two-year delays before professionals can examine their cases. This article delves into the reasons behind these delays, how they affect the lives of asylum seekers, and the potential steps the government can take to improve the situation. Asylum Seekers and the UK Healthcare System The UK's healthcare system, administered by the National Health Service (NHS), provides medical care to every citizen, including asylum seekers. The provision of healthcare is a critical aspect of the asylum process, as individuals escaping horrific circumstances might require urgent medical attention, psychological support, and that their claims of torture are thoroughly investigated. However, the NHS, which has long been struggling with an increased demand for its services, has led to a bottleneck in the process of examining and treating asylum seekers. Among the most affected are those who claim to be victims of torture, as they require specialized assessments by doctors to validate their claims and, subsequently, qualify for an appropriate asylum process. Reasons for Overburdened Caseloads Several factors contribute to the overwhelming caseload of doctors involved in examining torture victims as part of the asylum process, including: 1. Increase in the number of asylum seekers: As global conflicts continue to escalate in various countries, the UK has experienced a surge in the number of people seeking refuge. Consequently, the number of cases needing examination has increased, causing strain on the healthcare system. 2. Limited availability of specialized doctors: Assessing alleged torture victims requires highly qualified and experienced healthcare professionals, who may be in short supply, particularly in rural or understaffed areas. 3. Lack of funding: The NHS has been facing budgetary constraints in recent years, with limited resources available to manage the ever-growing number of patients. Consequently, there are fewer healthcare professionals to handle the workload. Impact on Asylum Seekers and Torture Victims Facing delays in accessing healthcare services, asylum seekers who claim to be torture victims are subjected to further distress, as evidenced by the following: 1. Prolonged suffering: As torture survivors wait for their cases to be examined, they continue to endure physical and mental health issues arising from their traumatic experiences. Delays in getting support may lead to the exacerbation of these ailments. 2. Negative impact on asylum application: The verification of torture claims is crucial for applications to be granted asylum status. Delays in medical assessments may result in prolonged legal limbo, creating an uncertain future for those affected. 3. Compartmentalization: Without proper documentation of their torture experiences, asylum seekers may have difficulty integrating into UK society and fully participating in community life. Recommendations for Improvement The following recommendations could potentially alleviate the backlog of cases pertaining to asylum seekers and torture victims: 1. Increase funding: The UK government must invest in healthcare services to boost staff and resource capacities. This would help medical professionals address the crisis more efficiently. 2. Collaborate with NGOs and international agencies: Collaboration with organizations such as the United Nations and non-governmental entities can help in providing both the financial and human resources needed to examine and process cases. 3. Streamline asylum processes: Simplifying the asylum process may reduce the caseload on healthcare professionals, thereby expediting the processing time for all asylum seekers. 4. Train more specialized professionals: Educational and training programs could focus on increasing the number of qualified healthcare practitioners who can assess torture victims. Conclusion The plight of asylum seekers and torture victims facing delays in their examination process is a pressing issue that calls for urgent attention. A combination of increased funding, better resource allocation, and collaboration with international organizations is required to alleviate the distress faced by these individuals. By addressing this issue head-on, the UK can continue to be a safe haven for asylum seekers, ensuring that they receive the support and care they so desperately need."},{"prompt":"Moses Mortimer Barrett III (born July 22 1973) known by the stage name Petey Pablo is an American rapper from Greenville North Carolina.

Answer the following question: Information: - The , also known as the , was a dynasty originating from one of the plethora of Japanese \\"daimys\\" which governed Japan from 1338 to 1573, the year in which Oda Nobunaga deposed Ashikaga Yoshiaki. The heads of government were the shoguns. Each was a member of the Ashikaga clan. - Biography. Yamana Szen was born to Yamana Tokihiro (13671435), head of the Yamana clan. Tokihiro was the \\"shugo\\" governor of Tajima, Bingo, Aki, and Iga provinces. Tokihiro, who was often in bad health, retired in 1433 and passed his numerous lands to Szen. Szen went on to defeat Akamatsu Mitsuhide (13731441) in the Kakitsu Incident, and became governor Harima Province the same year. - The in the history of Japan was a family who controlled the hereditary title of \\"shikken\\" (regent) of the Kamakura shogunate between 1203 and 1333. Despite the title, in practice the family wielded actual governmental power during this period compared to both the Kamakura shoguns, or the Imperial Court in Kyoto, whose authority was largely symbolic. The Hj are known for fostering Zen Buddhism and for leading the successful opposition to the Mongol invasions of Japan. Resentment at Hj rule eventually culminated in the overthrow of the clan and the establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate. - Moronao was an iconoclast with no intention of following tradition, particularly insofar as the Emperor was concerned. On the subject, he once said: What is the use of a King? Why should he live in a Palace? And why should we bow to him? If for some reason a King is needed, let us have one made of wood or metal, and let all the live Kings be banished. The Taiheiki, an epic dedicated to the events of this period, describes the K brothers as avid villains. Moronao in particular is accused of violence, greed and lewdness. Because of this reputation, in the \\"bunraku\\" and \\"kabuki\\" play \\"Kanadehon Chshingura\\", which depicts the vendetta of the 47 Ronin, his name is used to represent Kira Yoshinaka. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - On the August 16, 1443 (\\"Kakitsu 3, 21st day of the 7th month\\"), 10-year-old shogun Yoshikatsu died of injuries sustained in a fall from a horse. He had been shogun for only three years. Immediately, the \\"bakufu\\" elevated Yoshinari, the young shogun's even younger brother, to be the new shogun. Several years after becoming shogun, Yoshinari changed his name to Yoshimasa, by which name he is better known. - A was the military dictator of Japan during the period from 1185 to 1868 (with exceptions). In most of this period, the shoguns were the \\"de facto\\" rulers of the country; although nominally they were appointed by the Emperor as a ceremonial formality. The Shogun held almost absolute power over territories through military means. Nevertheless, an unusual situation occurred in the Kamakura period (11991333) upon the death of the first shogun, whereby the Hj clan's hereditary titles of \\"shikken\\" (1199-1256) and \\"tokus\\" (12561333) monopolized the shogunate as dictatorial positions, collectively known as the .

After the city of Edo was renamed Tokyo (meaning \\"Eastern Capital\\") in 1868, and the seat of the Emperor was transferred there, Kyoto was known for a short time as Saiky (meaning \\"Western Capital\\"). - Hosokawa Katsumoto ( , 1430 -- June 6 , 1473 ) was one of the Kanrei , the Deputies to the Shogun , during Japan 's Muromachi period . He is famous for his involvement in the creation of Ryan - ji , a temple famous for its rock garden , and for his involvement in the nin War , which sparked the 130 - year Sengoku period . His conflicts with his father - in - law , Yamana Szen , who resented the power Hosokawa had as Kanrei , were among those that ignited the nin War in 1467 . When the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa had a son in 1464 , Yamana took this as an opportunity to oppose Hosokawa further , supporting the child as heir to the Shogunate . Hosokawa had always worked closely with the Shogun 's brother Ashikaga Yoshimi , and supported his claim to the shogunate . In 1467 , open war broke out in the capital of Kyoto , between Hosokawa and Yamana , who each commanded roughly 80,000 men . The Shogun declared that the first to make war in the capital would be branded a rebel , and so the two armies remained immobile for some time , but within a few months , the tensions had risen too far , and war simply could not be delayed any further .

Yoshimi was the abbot of a Jdo monastery when he was first approached in 1464 by Hosokawa Katsumoto, who wished to support a bid for Yoshimi to become shogun. He originally sought to stick to his religious life, and had no desires to become shogun. However, by 1464, he was convinced to join his brother, the shogun, and assist him, putting himself into a position to be the next in the line of succession. The birth of the Shogun's son placed Yoshimi in an awkward situation, making his succession no longer definite, but he remained as Yoshimasa's Deputy. - The was a Japanese samurai clan which was one of the most powerful of the Muromachi period (1336-1467); at its peak, members of the family held the position of Constable (\\"shugo\\") over eleven provinces. Originally from Kzuke Province, and later centered in Inaba province, the clan claimed descendance from the Seiwa Genji line, and from Minamoto no Yoshishige in particular.

The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is abbess. What is the relationship between 'hosokawa katsumoto' and 'samurai'? Answer:","completion":"Hosokawa Katsumoto was a prominent Japanese samurai during the Muromachi period (1336-1467) and one of the Kanrei (Deputies to the Shogun). Born into the influential Hosokawa clan, Katsumoto made significant contributions to Japanese history, particularly his involvement in the creation of Ryōan-ji, a famous temple known for its rock garden, and his role in the Ōnin War. The Ōnin War (1467-1477) was a civil war that began as a dispute between Hosokawa Katsumoto and Yamana Sōzen over the succession of the Ashikaga shogunate after the retirement of Ashikaga Yoshimasa. Katsumoto supported Yoshimasa's brother, Ashikaga Yoshimi, while Sōzen supported Yoshimasa's son, Ashikaga Yoshihisa. The war eventually escalated into a nationwide conflict involving numerous daimyos (feudal lords) and their samurai armies. As a samurai, Hosokawa Katsumoto was a member of the warrior class that ruled feudal Japan and served a vital role in the military, administration, and governance of the country. The samurai class was characterized by their martial prowess, adherence to the code of bushido (the way of the warrior), which emphasized loyalty, honor, and personal integrity, and their service to a lord, or daimyo. In this capacity, Katsumoto was both a samurai warrior and a daimyo who led his own army of samurai during the Ōnin War."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Question 2: What can be the brilliant idea to deal with Alcohol/liquor sale in India by Govt. of India? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answering Question 1: Step 1: Find out the historical reasons for alcohol being sold in multiples of 180ml in India. According to historical information, the alcohol industry in India began to take off during the British colonial rule. Step 2: Understand the unit of measurement used during the British rule. During the British rule, the imperial system of measurements was widely used across India. One pint was a common unit of measurement, which is approximately equal to 568ml. Step 3: Discover the reasoning behind selling alcohol in smaller quantities than a pint. Due to affordability and accessibility, people preferred to consume alcohol in smaller quantities. Therefore, the alcohol industry in India started selling alcohol in half-pint bottles. Step 4: Convert half-pint to metric measurement. As one pint equals 568ml, half-pint measures approximately 284ml. Step 5: Identify the steps taken by the government to standardize alcohol measurements. The government eventually decided to standardize alcohol measurements in India to align more closely with the metric system. 180ml became a standard measure, replacing the half-pint (284ml) size. As a result, alcohol began to be sold primarily in multiples of 180ml in India. Answer to Question 1: Alcohol in India is sold in multiples of 180ml due to historical reasons when the alcohol industry started in India during British colonial rule. The measure shifted from half-pint (284ml) to 180ml as the government standardized alcohol measurements using the metric system. Answering Question 2: Step 1: Identify the objectives of the Indian government in dealing with alcohol sale. Some of the significant objectives of the Indian government concerning alcohol sale are revenue generation, regulating consumption, and ensuring public health and safety. Step 2: Consider a brilliant idea that addresses these objectives. One such idea could be the implementation of a central and state-regulated online platform for the sale and distribution of alcohol across the country. Step 3: Explain how the online platform would work. - Create a centralized and state-regulated online platform for purchasing alcohol. - Implement a digital ID verification system to ensure only legal-age customers can access the platform. - Set up a delivery system with licensed distributors responsible for fulfilling orders and ensuring proper handling. - Set up a monitoring system for the sale and consumption of alcohol. - Implement a taxation system that ensures revenue generation for states. Step 4: Highlight the benefits of the proposed system. - Reducing overconsumption and binge drinking through controlled sales - Ensuring the legal age limit for purchase and consumption is strictly adhered to - Providing a secure and transparent platform for buyers and sellers, reducing corruption in the alcohol trade - Ensuring state revenue is collected efficiently through a streamlined taxation system - Reducing incidences of spurious alcohol-related deaths by maintaining proper quality control Answer to Question 2: A brilliant idea for the government to deal with alcohol sale in India could be implementing a centralized and state-regulated online platform for sale and distribution of alcohol, which addresses objectives like revenue generation, controlling consumption, and maintaining public health and safety. To address the initial query, the answer to these two questions is not the same. The first question deals with the historical reasons behind alcohol being sold in multiples of 180ml, while the second question proposes an idea for the government to manage alcohol sales in India."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? which american sporting event took place for the first time in 1967?","completion":"The answer to this question is the Super Bowl. The first Super Bowl, known as Super Bowl I, took place on January 15, 1967. This American sporting event is the championship game played annually between the winners of the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC) within the National Football League (NFL). Super Bowl I featured the Green Bay Packers, representing the NFL, and the Kansas City Chiefs, representing the American Football League (AFL). At that time, the NFL and AFL were rival leagues, and the game was originally referred to as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game. The Packers won the game with a score of 35-10, and Packers' head coach Vince Lombardi would later have the trophy awarded to the winning team named in his honor – the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The idea of the Super Bowl came into existence as a result of the AFL-NFL merger in 1966. Both leagues agreed to have their respective champions face each other in a final game, in an effort to determine the world champion of American football. The first four Super Bowls were played between the AFL and NFL league champions before the two leagues completed their merger in 1970, creating the currently unified NFL with its two conferences, the NFC and AFC. The Super Bowl has since become the pinnacle of American sports and a cultural phenomenon, drawing millions of viewers worldwide. The championship game is usually played on the first Sunday of February, which has become known as \\"Super Bowl Sunday.\\" The event is marked by elaborate pre-game and halftime shows, featuring some of the most prominent musicians and performers in the entertainment industry. Additionally, the commercials aired during the broadcast have become a major aspect of the Super Bowl experience, as many companies compete to create the most memorable and entertaining ads. In summary, the American sporting event that took place for the first time in 1967 is the Super Bowl, which is the championship game between the NFC and AFC champions within the NFL. The first Super Bowl featured the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, with the Packers emerging as the first Super Bowl champions. Since then, the Super Bowl has evolved into a celebrated cultural event, reaching audiences across the globe and becoming a cornerstone of American sports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jason always drinks 4 cups of coffee every day unlike Leslie, because pick from the following. A). Jason hates the caffeine rush. B). Leslie hates the caffeine rush.","completion":"B). Leslie hates the caffeine rush. It was an ordinary day at the office as Jason reached for his fourth cup of coffee. The rich aroma of the freshly brewed coffee filled the air, keeping him alert and focused. He couldn't understand why Leslie, his coworker sitting just a few desks away, never seemed to enjoy the perks of caffeine-laced beverages. Leslie hated the caffeine rush, saying it made her feel anxious and jittery. Step 1: Observe the characters' preferences. Step 2: Consider their habits and reasoning behind those habits. Step 3: Incorporate those differences in their routines as the story progresses. Jason carefully sipped his coffee, making sure not to spill a drop on the important documents lying on his desk. As he continued to work on his report, he found himself pondering the pros and cons of his caffeine habit. On one hand, his productivity soared as the caffeine stimulated his senses; on the other hand, he relied heavily on the daily boost, feeling sluggish without it. Step 4: Introduce a conflict or dilemma for the characters. Step 5: Show the internal thought process as they assess the situation. Step 6: Develop a scenario that highlights the pros and cons of the characters' habits. As Jason was lost in his thoughts, Leslie walked over to his desk and placed a cup of herbal tea in front of him. \\"I noticed you've been reaching for that coffee quite often,\\" she said with a friendly smile. \\"Why don't you give this a try? It might help clear your mind and still keep you focused.\\" Step 7: Bring the characters together to discuss their habits. Step 8: Initiate a dialogue that addresses the issue at hand. Step 9: Present a potential solution or alternative for the characters to consider. Jason hesitated but decided to give the herbal tea a chance. After all, the thought of potentially becoming less dependent on caffeine was appealing. He took a sip and found the taste to be calming, a contrast to the bold flavor of coffee. Though it didn't have the same energizing effect, it did help him to concentrate without the jittery side effects. Step 10: Show the characters making an effort to understand and adapt to each other's habits. Step 11: Describe the outcome of their attempts to change or compromise. Step 12: Conclude the story by demonstrating a lesson learned or a newfound understanding. Over the next few weeks, Jason alternated between coffee and herbal tea, learning to appreciate the benefits of both. He no longer relied solely on coffee to keep him alert, and Leslie even tried a cup or two herself, finding that she could enjoy the caffeine rush in moderation.

Meanwhile, the National Weather Service canceled tsunami advisories for Canada, Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California. Tsunami Warning Center officials said wave heights were diminishing in Hawaii, though swimmers and boaters should be careful of strong or unusual currents. The biggest waves — about 5 feet (1.5 meters)high — appeared to hit Maui. There were no immediate reports of damage, though one person died in a fatal crash near a road that was closed because of the threat near Oahu’s north shore. Hawaii Gov.

Information: - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit. - Night Stalker is an action shooting video game for the Intellivision console . - The Intellivision is a home video game console released by Mattel Electronics in 1979. Development of the console began in 1978, less than a year after the introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600.

After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'night stalker ' with the relationship of 'developer'. Choices: - atari - atari , inc . - french - intellivision - mattel - produce Answer:","completion":"The entity related to 'Night Stalker' with the relationship of 'developer' is Mattel. The text specifies that \\"Night Stalker is an action shooting video game for the Intellivision console\\" and the Intellivision console was released by \\"Mattel Electronics\\". Therefore, it would be appropriate to infer that Mattel, the company that created and released the Intellivision console, would also be the developer of the games that are compatible with their system. It is a common practice for home console creators to also develop games exclusive to their platforms, especially during the early stages of a console's life in order to generate interest in their product. Moreover, when parsing the relationship between 'Night Stalker' and 'developer', it is also crucial to note that video games can be developed by a variety of entities including individuals, small teams, or large corporations. This differs from other types of traditional media like movies and music, where the production process is more standardized and typically involves a bigger team. In the case of 'Night Stalker', it was developed by a commercial company (Mattel) for its own dedicated gaming platform (the Intellivision). Lastly, it's worth mentioning that the development of a video game incorporates various elements such as designing and coding the game, creating and integrating visual art and animations, composing and fitting music and sound effects, and possibly writing dialogue and storylines. Hence, saying that Mattel is the developer of 'Night Stalker' implicitly implies that Mattel would be responsible for these facets of the game's production. It also signifies that Mattel might own the intellectual property rights to 'Night Stalker', meaning they would have control over its distribution and any potential sequels or spin-offs. So, when we understand 'developer' in this broad context, Mattel fits into that category for 'Night Stalker'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Next question: what happened to guam during the spanish american war?","completion":"The Spanish-American War, which lasted from April to August 1898, was a conflict between the United States and Spain, primarily over the issue of Cuba. However, the war also had significant impacts on other Spanish territories in the Pacific, including Guam, an island in the Mariana Islands archipelago. Before the war, Guam had been a Spanish possession for more than 300 years, following its colonization by the Spanish empire in the 17th century. By the 19th century, it served as a key coaling station for Spanish naval and merchant vessels sailing between the Philippines and the Americas. As the Spanish-American War unfolded, the United States sought to weaken Spain's presence in the Pacific and acquire its territories in the region. On June 20, 1898, under orders from President William McKinley and Secretary of the Navy John D. Long, Captain Henry Glass of the U.S.S. Charleston was directed to \\"capture, destroy, or expel\\" Spanish armed forces from Guam. The U.S.S. Charleston, along with three transport ships carrying troops of the 1st California Volunteer Regiment, arrived off the coast of Guam on June 20, 1898. Surprisingly, the Spanish authorities on the island were completely unaware that their country was at war with the United States at the time and were unprepared for any sort of conflict. Captain Glass ordered his crew to fire a few rounds from the Charleston's cannons as a means of provocation. The Spanish governor, Juan Marina, initially believed these shots to be a salute, and he sent a small boat with officers to return the \\"salute,\\" only to be informed by the Americans that war had been declared and that they were taking over the island. The Spanish governor, along with 54 Spanish soldiers and civilians, were subsequently captured and sent back to Manila as prisoners of war. Thus, the taking of Guam by the United States was a bloodless event. There was no fighting or loss of life on either side, and the island was captured without serious resistance. On December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed, formally ending the Spanish-American War. Under the terms of the treaty, Spain ceded Guam, along with Puerto Rico and the Philippines, to the United States, marking the end of Spanish colonial rule in the Pacific territories.

Article: The revolution was over by the time Tom Ford started working in the fashion world. The expensive fashion design houses such as Channel, Yves Saint Laurent, and Christian Dior, which earned money by designing and making very expensive custom clothes, had lost many of their wealthy customers. To stay in business, they started selling more reasonably priced ready-to-wear clothing along with a wide range of accessories , that is, related products such as shoes, bags, watches. All of these products needed to blend with the clothing and with each other so that they made up a brand that everyone would recognize and wanted to buy. Though they did not use that name, each company needed a \\"master designer.\\" Born in Texas and growing up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Ford had a diverse background in the arts. Soon after completing high school, he moved to New York, where he studied art history, trained as an actor, and worked as a model. Following that, Ford completed a program in indoor design, but later decided that he was more interested in designing clothes than in decorating house. He was hired by the firm Cathy Hardwick in 1986, where he began to work as a fashion designer. His talent stood out from the rest and soon he moved to Perry Ellis, where he became design director. Then in 1990 he made an important move by taking a position with the New York branch of Gucci, the famous design house based in Milan, Italy. During his first years at Gucci, the company was going through a very difficult period. Its products were once considered highly desirable, and were worn by famous women such as Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, and Jacqueline Kennedy. However, by the early 1990s they had lost their reputation for quality. Other producers had started making cheap, widely available imitations of the brand, and the sales of Gucci's own products had dropped. Things were so bad at one point that Ford was almost fired. However, some people at the company believed in his talent, and in 1994 they hired him to work in Milan as the creative...

James Maury \\"Jim\\" Henson (September 24, 1936 - May 16, 1990) was an American puppeteer, artist, cartoonist, inventor, screenwriter, and filmmaker who achieved international fame as the creator of the Muppets. He was born in Greenville, Mississippi and raised in Leland, Mississippi and Hyattsville, Maryland. Henson began developing puppets while attending high school. He created Sam and Friends while he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park, a five-minute sketch-comedy puppet show that appeared on television. James Maury Henson was born in Greenville, Mississippi on September 24, 1936, the younger of two children of Paul Ransom Henson (1904-1994), an agronomist for the United States Department of Agriculture, and his wife Betty Marcella (nee Brown, 1904-1992). He was raised as a Christian Scientist and spent his early childhood in Leland, Mississippi, before moving with his family to University Park, Maryland in the late 1940s, near Washington, D.C. He remembered the arrival of the family's first television as \\"the biggest event of his adolescence,\\" having been heavily influenced by radio ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and the early television puppets of Burr Tillstrom on Kukla, Fran and Ollie and Bil and Cora Baird. He remained a Christian Scientist at least into his twenties when he would teach Sunday School, but he wrote to a Christian Science church in 1975 to inform them that he was no longer a practicing member. Henson began working for WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV) in 1954 while attending Northwestern High School, creating puppets for a Saturday morning children's show called The Junior Morning Show. He enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park as a studio arts major upon graduation, thinking that he might become a commercial artist. A puppetry class offered in the applied arts department introduced him to the craft and textiles courses in the College of Home Economics, and he graduated in 1960 with a BS in home economics. As a freshman, he had been asked to create Sam and Friends, a five-minute puppet show for WRC-TV. The characters on Sam and Friends were forerunners of the Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson's most famous character Kermit the Frog. He remained at WRC from 1954 to 1961. In the show, Henson began experimenting with techniques that changed the way in which puppetry was used on television, including using the frame defined by the camera shot to allow the puppet performer to work from off-camera. He believed that television puppets needed to have \\"life and sensitivity\\" and began making characters from flexible, fabric-covered foam rubber, allowing them to express a wider array of emotions at a time when many puppets were made of carved wood. A marionette's arms are manipulated by strings, but Henson used rods to move his Muppets' arms, allowing greater control of expression. Additionally, he wanted the Muppet characters to \\"speak\\" more creatively than was possible for previous puppets, which had random mouth movements, so he used precise mouth movements to match the dialogue. When Henson began work on Sam and Friends, he asked fellow University of Maryland sophomore Jane Nebel to assist him. The show was a financial success but, after graduating from college, he began to have doubts about going into a career performing with puppets. He spent several months in Europe, where he was inspired by European puppet performers who looked on their work as an art form. He and Jane began dating after his return to the United States. They were married in 1959 and had five children: Lisa (b. 1960), Cheryl (b. 1961), Brian (b. 1963), John (b. 1965, d. 2014), and Heather (b. 1970).

Which patient would more likely consume more food than needed, patient A or patient B? John is a physician in the local hospital. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. John determines that patient A is obese, and patient B is not obese. He needs to prescribe medicine according to his findings. Hint: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The answer is:","completion":"Patient A would more likely consume more food than needed. The paragraph mentions that obesity occurs when the body mass index (BMI) is 30.0 kg/m2 or greater, and that people who consistently consume more food energy than they need may become obese. Patient A is described as being obese, while Patient B is not. This indicates that Patient A has been consuming more food and energy than their body requires, leading to the storage of unused energy in the form of body fat. The hint provided explains that any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. This suggests that individuals who consume more food than needed gain weight due to the accumulation of excess body fat. Consequently, obese individuals, such as patient A, are likely to have consumed more food than needed compared to non-obese individuals, such as patient B. Moreover, the doctor, John, is responsible for prescribing medicine according to his findings. In this case, he would likely be prescribing medication or recommending lifestyle changes that address the issue of obesity in patient A by focusing on their excess food consumption that has contributed to their weight gain. This reinforces the idea that patient A is more likely to consume more food than needed when compared to patient B. In conclusion, given the details provided in the paragraph, patient A would more likely consume more food than needed when compared to patient B. This is because patient A is obese, which is a result of consistently consuming more food energy than required, thus causing an accumulation of body fat and an increased BMI."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 298 victims on board tragic flight MH17 would have been killed instantly or remained conscious for only a few seconds after the plane was struck down by a missile, an Australian expert has claimed. Forensic scientist David Royds, from the University of Canberra, told the Herald Sun that it's 'very unlikely the passengers would have suffered' when the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200 was shot down by pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine. As investigators continue to piece together what happened, Professor Royds' analysis offers some comfort to the families of the victims, including 37 Australians, who he says would have had 'no time to worry'. 'It’s very unlikely the passengers would have suffered, there would have been no time to worry,' he told the Herald Sun. Scroll down for video. Professor Royds says the victims would not have had time to react to what happened, if not killed instantly, when the missile struck MH17. The bodies of the around 200 victims have been transported to eastern Ukraine. Professor Royd says dramatic and immediate drops in temperature and cabin pressure would have rendered them unconscious. David Royds (right), who led investigations in the Bali bombing, says passengers would not have suffered. Professor Boyd, who led forensic investigations into the Bali bombings, says that an explosion would have triggered a chain reaction that would have 'rendered the passengers unconscious within seconds' - including dramatic and instant drops in air pressure and temperature and a loss of oxygen. It comes as victims' bodies were transported via train to eastern Ukraine, but families were concerned that the painstaking identification process could take months. An Australian air force plane and refrigerated trucks have arrived in Holland but Ukraine says there were only 200 recovered from the crash site. Experts are also concerned that readings from MH17's black boxes may reveal nothing about the attack, rendering them virtually useless to investigators. And while photos have emerged showing damage to the front panels from the doomed airline point, which may be conclusive evidence of a missile strike, Professor Boyd says the victims' bodies themselves may provide 'trace evidence of shrapnel wounds'. Photographs show pieces of the Boeing 777 have tiny holes indicating small pieces of shrapnel entered the aircraft externally, it has been reported. A piece of wreckage from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, in a field near Rozsypne in the eastern Ukraine, several miles from the largest concentration of debris. According to analysts, the perforation holes visible on the debris are consistent with high-velocity shrapnel from fragmenting warheads like the SA-11 \\"Buk\\" missiles American officials have said likely brought down the plane. Experts have warned that the 'black boxes' from MH17 may yield nothing about the attack, rendering them virtually useless to investigators. Reed Foster, a defense analyst, told the New York Times that the two likely causes were an engine explosion or an exploding missile. According to Mr Foster, the SA-11 missiles intercept targeted aircraft before exploding near it creating a cloud of shrapnel. An SA-11 missile carries about 46 pounds of explosives and detonates about 100 to 300 feet away from the target. Meanwhile Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Operation Bring Them Home - to bring the 37 Australian victims back - would be headed up by former defence chief Angus Houston, who also coordinated Australian search efforts for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The refrigerated train carrying the dead has arrived in Kharkiv - in Ukraine's east - where Australian and Dutch representatives will prepare them for transport to the Netherlands for the identification process. A Boeing C-17 of the Australian Air Force stands at the Eindhoven Airbase in The Netherlands. The aircraft will, together with aircrafts of the Dutch Air Force, repatriate from Kharkiv to Eindhoven the bodies of the victims. Mr Abbott also wrote in the condolence book for the plane crash victims on Tuesday at Parliament House. Carriages of death: A train carrying the remains victims of the Malaysia Airlines MH17 disaster arrives in the Ukrainian government-held city of Kharkiv. Journalists follow the train as it arrives in the city of Kharkiv, where the victims will be flown to the Netherlands. The transportation and identification process in Ukraine and the Netherlands will involve consular officers, Australian Federal Police experts and air safety investigators. Despite Tuesday's progress, Mr Abbott warned there was 'still a long, long way to go'. 'After the crime comes the cover-up,' he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. 'What we have seen is evidence tampering on an industrial scale, and obviously that has to stop.' Mr Abbott said he understood the families' frustration at the lengthy process, but it was something that needed to be done. 'I need to caution that this is necessarily a painstaking and methodical process that will take some weeks,' he said. The train arrived in Kharkiv on Tuesday night, carrying the bodies of MH17 victims from the crash site. The bodies will be flown to the Netherlands from Kharkiv to be formally identified by forensic and identification experts. Operation Bring Them Home started just hours after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop helped secure a unanimous vote in the United Nations Security Council to allow 'safe, secure, full and unrestricted access' to the Malaysia Airlines crash site for international investigators in a move to find out who is responsible for the tragedy. 'There must be a ceasefire in the immediate area around the site,' Ms Bishop told the Security Council. 'The victims must be treated with dignity, brought back to their homes and laid to rest.'All parties are required to fully cooperate with these efforts. 'Russia must use its influence over the separatists to ensure this. Russia must also use its influence to bring the conflict in Ukraine to an end.'

Mr Abbott's formal message of condolence to the victims' families on behalf of the nation. Pro-Russian separatists - who stand accused of bringing down the aircraft, possibly with a missile supplied by Moscow - bowed to a furious clamour for the bodies and black boxes to be handed to investigators five days after the crash. Mr Razak said the boxes were handed over to the Malaysian team in Donetsk at 9pm Ukraine time on Monday. The small handing over ceremony has finally solved the question as to what had happened to the two vital devices. Mr Razak revealed that in recent days the team had been working quietly behind the scenes to establish contact with 'those' - a reference to the rebels - in charge of the MH17 crash site. The contact was finally made - but he made it clear it had not been easy. 'Under difficult and fluid circumstances, we have been discussing the problems that have occupied us all - securing vital evidence from the aircraft, launching an independent investigation and above all recovering the remains of those who lost their lives.' The Prime Minister said that in. another breakthrough an independent international investigation team. would be guaranteed safe access to the crash site. 'I. must stress that although agreement has been reached, there remain a. number of steps required before it is completed,' Mr Razak said. Tragic: A toy is placed at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 near the village of Hrabove, eastern Ukraine. UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond said all the evidence currently available indicates that the surface-to-air missile which destroyed the MH17 was supplied by Russia. 'There. is work still to be done, work which relies on continued communication. in good faith. [Rebel leader] Mr Borodai and his people have so far. given their co-operation. 'I. ask that all parties continue to work together to ensure that this. agreement is honoured; that the remains of our people are returned, that. the black box is handed over, and that the international team is. granted full access to the site. 'Only. then can the investigation into MH17 truly begin; only then can the. victims be afforded the respect they deserve. We need to know what. caused the plane to crash, and who was responsible for it, so that. justice may be done. 'In. recent days, there were times I wanted to give greater voice to the. anger and grief that the Malaysian people feel. And that I feel. But. sometimes, we must work quietly in the service of a better outcome. 'I. understand that for the families, nothing can undo this damage. The. lives taken cannot be given back; the dignity lost cannot be regained. 'My. heart reaches out to those whose loved ones were lost on MH17.

An expert says that the passengers probably didn't suffer, because everything happened very fast. They would have been unconscious quickly after the missile hit the plane. There are special boxes called \\"black boxes\\" that can help figure out what happened during a crash, but in this case, they might not help investigators as much as we hope.

Context: The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Question: In humans, a trait can be determined by one pair or many pairs of pick from the following. *genes; *microbes; *cells; *organs; Answer:","completion":"In humans, a trait can be determined by one pair or many pairs of genes. Traits are specific characteristics or features that are inherited from one generation to another through the transmission of genetic information. Genes are segments of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that are responsible for encoding instructions on how to synthesize proteins or regulate the expression of other genes. These proteins and their expression patterns ultimately determine the specific traits observed in an individual. In some cases, a single pair of genes (one from each parent) is responsible for determining a trait. This type of inheritance is called Mendelian inheritance or simple inheritance, named after Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics. Mendel's experiments on pea plants led to the discovery of the basic laws of inheritance. In Mendelian inheritance, a single gene has a dominant and a recessive allele, with the dominant allele expressing itself in an individual's phenotype if present, even if the recessive allele is present as well. An example of a Mendelian trait is a person's blood type, which can be A, B, AB, or O. In other cases, a trait can be determined by many pairs of genes, interacting in different ways to produce a wide range of phenotypic outcomes. This is known as polygenic inheritance. In polygenic traits, multiple genes contribute to the final characteristic, and the phenotypic expression of an individual depends on the combination of alleles inherited from both parents and the way these genes interact with one other and the environment. Examples of polygenic traits include human skin color, height, and eye color. The wide variation in these traits among individuals is due to the collective influences of numerous genes and external factors such as nutrition or sunlight exposure. It is important to note that while genes play a vital role in determining the traits of an individual, they do not act in isolation. The environment in which a person lives, their experiences, and various other factors can also significantly impact the expression of traits and contribute to the complexity of human phenotypic diversity. As our understanding of genetics and the influence of other factors on traits advances, it becomes increasingly evident that the intricate combination of genetics and environmental interactions plays a crucial role in determining the unique traits exhibited by humans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. Are the volcanoes on Sarahn more or less active than on Timon? Hint: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, we can infer that the volcanoes on Sarahn would be more active than on Timon. The planet Sarahn is going through a large geographic shift, much like Earth during the Paleozoic era, with continents breaking apart and moving. This movement causes increased volcanic activity as more oceanic crust is formed. When continents move apart, new oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. This new crust is relatively hotter and less dense than the older oceanic crust, which causes the ocean floor to rise and subsequently leads to a rise in sea level. This increased volcanic activity is indicative of a more geologically active environment on Sarahn, as demonstrated by the historical examples of Earth during the Paleozoic era. On the other hand, Timon is described as a stable planet with no continental movement for quite some time. This implies that there is less volcanic activity, as there is no ongoing process of continental drift and formation of new oceanic crust. As a result, the volcanic activity on Timon would be less active compared to that on Sarahn. In conclusion, the active geological transformations occurring on Sarahn, such as continental drift and the formation of new oceanic crust through volcanic activity, make it more likely that the volcanoes on Sarahn would be more active than those on Timon. Timon's lack of continental movement and overall stability result in less volcanic activity. Thus, we can determine that the volcanoes on Sarahn are more active compared to those on Timon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This jaw may belong to Philip II, father of Alexander the Great. A decades-old mystery about the body of Alexander the Great's father has been solved, anthropologists claim. A new analysis of bones from a Macedonian tomb complex reveals a skeleton with a knee injury so severe that it would have caused a noticeable limp in life. This injury matches some historical records of one sustained by Philip II, whose nascent empire Alexander the Great would expand all the way to India. The skeleton in question, however, is not the one initially thought to be Philip II's — instead, it comes from the tomb next door. The skeletons are the subject of an entrenched debate among experts on ancient Greece and Macedonia. While some praised the new study, others pushed back, suggesting the new research will not quell 40 years of controversy. \\"The knee is the clincher,\\" said Maria Liston, an anthropologist at the University of Waterloo, who was not involved in the new study, which is detailed today (July 20) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). [See Photos of the Tomb at Vergina and Mysterious 'Philip' Bones] \\"This publication in PNAS is incorrect,\\" said Theodore Antikas, a researcher at Aristotle University in Greece and author of another controversial study on bones from the tombs. A violent history This artist's impression reveals how the fused bones would have set Philip II's leg in a permanently bent position. Credit: Image Courtesy Arturo Asensio The story of Philip II is wrought with twists and turns. In 336 B.C., the king was murdered by one of his bodyguards. The motives for the assassination are unclear. Some ancient historians wrote that the murder was an act of revenge stemming from a sordid tale of suicide and sexual assault between Philip II's male lovers and other members of the court. Whatever the cause, murder was de rigueur for the Macedonian royal family. Within days of Philip II's murder, one of his wives, Olympias — mother of Alexander the Great — let her own homicidal tendencies run free. According to the Latin historian Justin, Olympias killed the newborn daughter of Philip II's newest wife, Cleopatra, in her mother's arms. She then forced Cleopatra to hang herself. A generation later, after the death of Alexander the Great, the conqueror's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (also spelled Arrhidaios) took the throne. Philip III Arrhidaeus was king in name only, and ancient historians record him as being mentally unfit. His wife, Eurydice, was a warrior, however. She was determined to make her husband more than a figurehead puppet for Alexander's generals, who were by this time vying for power in the void left by his death. But Philip III Arrhidaeus and Eurydice would lose that battle. In 317 B.C., Olympias came out against them. The couple's troops refused to fight the forces of the mother of Alexander the Great. Olympias had the pair killed and buried. Some months later, they were exhumed and cremated in a display to shore up legitimacy for the next king. [Family Ties: 8 Truly Dysfunctional Royal Families] Cremation and controversy Philip II. Cleopatra. Philip III. Eurydice. When archaeologists uncovered a Macedonian tomb complex near the Greek city of Vergina in the 1970s, they knew they had royal burials on their hands. But which tombs belonged to which royals? There are three tombs at the site. Tomb I had been plundered in antiquity but contained human remains and an intricate wall painting of the Rape of Persephone. Tomb II was intact. Inside were the cremated bones of a man and a woman, surrounded by armor and other lavish items. Tomb III is widely accepted to belong to Alexander IV, Alexander the Great's son. Initially, the bodies in lavish Tomb II were identified as those of Philip II and Cleopatra. But debate has raged over possible injuries to the male skull, over the ages and dating of the skeletons, and over whether the bones were burned with flesh on or off. (As Philip III Arridaeus was cremated long after burial, archaeologists looked for signs that the bones had been burned after the flesh had rotted away.) Many archaeologists suspected the two burned bodies were not Philip II and Cleopatra, but Philip III and Eurydice. The two sides have been lobbing research papers at each other for years, but seemed at an impasse. \\"In fact, the issue has become eminently political, and for years a sort of vendetta has been raging between factions,\\" said historian Miltiades Hatzopoulos of International Hellenic University, who was not involved in the new research. Now, Antonis Bartsiokas of Democritus University of Thrace in Greece has taken a different tact. Instead of examining the burnt bones in Tomb II, he and his team took a close look at three skeletons from the tomb next door. The smoking gun The analysis revealed that the man in Tomb I was in his 40s when he died, and stood 5 feet 9 inches tall (180 centimeters) — impressive for the era. The woman died around 18 years of age, based on measurements of the fusion of her bones. She was about 5 feet 4 inches tall (165 cm). The baby was a newborn, probably only a week to three weeks past the due date. The ages match historical records of Philip II, Cleopatra and their infant. But the real smoking gun, Liston said, was a knee injury on the male skeleton. The left leg of an adult male skeleton found in Tomb I at Vergina. The thigh bone (femur) and one of the bones of the lower leg (the tibia) are fused, and hole at the knee suggests a devastating penetrating injury. Credit: Image Courtesy Javier Trueba The man's left thigh bone, or femur, had fused with one of his lower leg bones, the tibia. This fusion left the knee joint frozen in place at a 79-degree angle. A hole in the bone suggests the wound was caused by a penetrating injury from a projectile, such as a spear. And that's where things get exciting. According to historical records, Philip II was injured in the leg during a battle in 345 B.C. He then limped for the rest of his life. \\"When I found the femur fused to the tibia at the knee joint, I suddenly remembered the leg injury of Philip, but I could not recall any details,\\" Bartsiokas told Live Science. \\"I then ran to study the historical evidence.\\" He found a description of Philip II's wounds in the writings of the ancient historian Justin. \\"At that moment,\\" he wrote in an email to Live Science, \\"I knew the bone must belong to Philip!\\" [Bones With Names: Long-Dead Bodies Archaeologists Have Identified] The injury does match descriptions of Philip II's limp, the University of Waterloo's Liston said. \\"This was a devastating injury that separated the knee joint and left it probably completely unstable until it fused,\\" Liston told Live Science. The pain would have been excruciating, she said. After reading the new PNAS paper, she said, she asked two middle-age men at her lab in Athens to stand on one foot, with the toes of the other foot just touching the ground. The angles of their knees were 72 degrees and 80 degrees. This ad hoc experiment suggests that, like Philip II, the man in the tomb could have walked, but only with difficulty. He probably could have ridden a horse — but he may have been vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat. \\"This injury may also explain why Philip, a skilled warrior, was so utterly unable to fight off the assassins,\\" Liston said. \\"With this knee, he would have limited mobility and very poor balance.\\" An end to controversy? If Philip II and his wife and baby occupy Tomb I, it stands to reason that Philip III and his wife are the contested skeletons in Tomb II, Bartsiokas and his colleagues write today (July 20) in PNAS. [See Images of the Tomb II and Bones Inside] Whether the finding will rewrite history remains to be seen. The museum at the site of the Royal Tombs of Vergina identifies Tomb II, not Tomb I, as belonging to Philip II. So does UNESCO, which classifies the monuments as a royal heritage site. \\"These are bold claims that I don't think will be very welcome in certain quarters in Greece,\\" said Jonathan Musgrave, an anatomist at the University of Bristol, who has argued that the bones in Tomb II belong to Philip II and Cleopatra. Indeed, researchers who have argued for Tomb II as Philip II's final resting place were not quickly convinced by the new study. In 2014, two bags of human and animal bones were found in a storage area with plaster from Tomb I, Antikas told Live Science. He and his team have analyzed those bones, he said, and found that Tomb I contained not two adults and a baby as discussed in Bartsiokas' new paper, but two adults, a teenager, a fetus and three newborns. Those findings have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, pending permission for further study from Greece's Central Archaeological Council, Antikas said. \\"Any prejudgment concerning the occupants is impossible before the complete context is re-examined,\\" said Chrysoula Paliadeli, an archaeologist at the director of the Aristotle University excavations at Vergina. Even the \\"smoking gun\\" leg wound falls under scrutiny; ancient historians were not always very detailed or clear with their sourcing. Bartsiokas and his team trust the writings of Demosthenes, a contemporary of Philip II, who simply wrote that the king was wounded in his leg. But 300 years later historian Didymos wrote that Philip's wound was in his right thigh, said Hatzopoulos of International Hellenic University. The wound on the skeleton analyzed by Bartsiokas was on the left leg. It might seem natural to trust the historian who was writing at the time of Philip II's life versus the one writing 300 years later, but Didymos' source was probably Theopompos, who did live at the same time as Philip II, Hatzopoulos said. \\"Having followed this controversy through four decades I have come to the conclusion that in this particular issue one cannot put much faith in the so-called 'exact sciences,'\\" Hatzopoulos said. \\"Reputed scientists have contradicted one another time and time again.\\" Bartsiokas and his team seemed prepared for ongoing strife. \\"I think that we have made a very strong case,\\" said study co-author Juan-Luis Arsuaga of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. \\"Now the focus of attention will turn to Tomb I.

The age estimates of the three occupants are consistent with those derived from the historical sources. Cleopatra's (Philip’s wife) child was born a few days before Philip II’s assassination and both were murdered soon after Philip’s assassination. It follows that Tomb II belongs to King Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydice and may well contain some of the armor of Alexander the Great. Thus, a nearly 40-y-old mystery concerning the Royal Tombs of Vergina has finally been solved that puzzled historians, archaeologists, and physical anthropologists. Abstract King Philip II was the father of Alexander the Great. He suffered a notorious penetrating wound by a lance through his leg that was nearly fatal and left him lame in 339 B.C.E. (i.e., 3 y before his assassination in 336 B.C.E.). In 1977 and 1978 two male skeletons were excavated in the Royal Tombs II and I of Vergina, Greece, respectively. Tomb I also contained another adult (likely a female) and a newborn skeleton. The current view is that Philip II was buried in Tomb II. However, the male skeleton of Tomb II bears no lesions to his legs that would indicate lameness. We investigated the skeletal material of Tomb I with modern forensic techniques. The male individual in Tomb I displays a conspicuous case of knee ankylosis that is conclusive evidence of lameness. Right through the overgrowth of the knee, there is a hole. There are no obvious signs that are characteristic of infection and osteomyelitis. This evidence indicates that the injury was likely caused by a severe penetrating wound to the knee, which resulted in an active inflammatory process that stopped years before death. Standard anthropological age-estimation techniques based on dry bone, epiphyseal lines, and tooth analysis gave very wide age ranges for the male, centered around 45 y. The female would be around 18-y-old and the infant would be a newborn. It is concluded that King Philip II, his wife Cleopatra, and their newborn child are the occupants of Tomb I. ||||| There are many unrecorded conquerors, battles and Romeo and Juliets in the vastness of prehistory whose stories are waiting to be told.

Campbell, director of archaeology at the Albanian Center for Marine Research. \\"The greatest age of discovery is happening right now. And the real fun is just about to begin,\\" Campbell said. The “Tomb of Philip” in the northern Greek town of Vergina does not belong to King Philip II of Macedon, says new research which fuels the long-standing dispute over the final resting place of Alexander the Great’s father. According to the study, a skeleton found in an adjacent tomb shows evidence of a leg wound which is consistent with the one sustained by Philip II, as reported by some historical accounts. The claim is in stark contrast to other research published two months ago which maintains Alexander the Great’s father was indeed buried in the famous “Tomb of Philip.” Photos: Great Archaeological Discoveries Ahead Scholars have argued over Philip II’s tomb ever since Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos discovered the site of his likely burial in 1977-78. He excavated a large mound — the Great Tumulus — at Vergina on the advice of the English classicist Nicholas Hammond. Among the monuments found within the tumulus were three tombs. One, called Tomb I, had been looted, but contained a stunning wall painting of the Rape of Persephone, along with fragmentary human remains. Tomb II remained undisturbed and contained the almost complete cremated remains of a male skeleton in the main chamber and the cremated remains of a female in the antechamber. Grave goods included silver and bronze vessels, gold wreaths, weapons, armor and two gold larnakes. Tomb III was also found undisturbed, with a silver funerary urn that contained the bones of a young male, and a number of silver vessels and ivory reliefs. “There is an unanimous agreement that Tomb III, which has a façade strikingly similar to that of Tomb II, belongs to Alexander the Great’s son, Alexander IV,” Antonis Bartsiokas of the Democritus University of Thrace and Juan-Luis Arsuaga of the Centro Mixto Universidad Complutense de Madrid and colleagues wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). In fact, most of the scholarly debate concentrates on the occupants of Tomb II. “Despite anthropological and archaeological evidence that the tomb belongs to King Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydice, the archaeological establishment still maintains that Tomb II belongs to Philip II,” the researchers wrote. Remains of Alexander the Great's Father Confirmed Found A powerful 4th century B.C. military ruler from the Greek kingdom of Macedon, King Philip II gained control of Greece and the Balkan peninsula through tactful use of warfare, diplomacy, and marriage alliances (the Macedonians practiced polygamy). His efforts — he reformed the Macedonian army and proposed the invasion of Persia — later provided the basis for the achievements of his son and successor Alexander the Great, who went on to conquer most of the known world. The overlord of an empire stretching from Greece and Egypt eastward across Asia to India, Alexander died in Babylon, now in central Iraq, in June of 323 B.C. — just before his 33rd birthday. His elusive tomb is one of the great unsolved mysteries of the ancient world. Using scanning and radiography, Bartsiokas and colleagues analyzed a partial skeleton of a middle-aged male that had been long disinterred from Tomb I at Vergina. The researchers judged the individual to be around 45 when he died, matching the age at which Philip was killed, and estimated he was 5.9 feet tall. Photos: Female Sculptures Revealed in Greek Tomb They noticed the individual had a knee joint showing signs of fusion (ankylosis), and a hole through the overgrowth of the knee, likely produced by a penetrating instrument, such as a fast-moving projectile, like a spear. The wound “would have affected locomotion and rendered the person lame, with an uneven gait,” the researchers concluded. According to some historical reports, a lance impaled Philip’s leg three years before his assassination in 336 BC, leaving him lame. The injury “is conclusive evidence for the identification of one tomb occupant as Philip,” the researchers said. Bartsiokas and colleagues also stated that Tomb I contains the remains of a 18-year-old female and a 42-week-old infant of unknown gender. The researchers believe the individuals are Philip’s wife Cleopatra, and their newborn child, both killed shortly after Philip’s death. He was killed by his bodyguard Pausanias as he walked into a theater in the Macedonian capital of Aegae. “As a consequence, Tomb II could only belong to King Arrhidaeus and Eurydice and may well contain some of the armor of Alexander the Great,” Bartsiokas and colleagues concluded. However, according to Theodore Antikas, author of another study which concluded the bones found in Tomb II are those of Philip II and a Scythian princess, Bartsiokas and colleagues are missing a point—or more precisely, some bones. In a letter to the editor of PNAS, Antikas, head of the anthropological research team of Vergina Excavation at Aristotle University, maintains Bartsiokas’s research has been done on a small part of the bones found in Tomb I in 1977-78. According to the researcher, the bones from Tomb I took different routes ever since their discovery. Some were first kept at Vergina, and some were sent to the Archaeological Museum in Thessaloniki (AMT). ||||| Portrait of King Philip II of Macedonia in his late years, after having received a wound through his left leg by a lance. Credit: Arturo Asensio. A team of researchers from Greece, Spain and France has found evidence that suggests that the bones of King Phillip II of Macedon—father of Alexander the Great, were those found in Tomb I, not those found in Tomb II at the burial site in Vergina, Macedonia. The team's work and their findings have been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Back in 1977, archeologists discovered ancient tombs at Vergina, and soon thereafter, researchers began offering arguments regarding the identities of the skeletons that were found in them—the focus of most of the attention has been on Tombs I and II, because it is believed they were the final resting place for some of Alexander the Great's relatives—most specifically, his father. Early on, many believed the bones found in Tomb II were his, though the identity of others buried along with him remained a matter of speculation. This theory was further bolstered by work done by a team of researches with results published just this past May. In this new effort, the researchers cite evidence that they believe proves bones found in Tomb I are those of Phillip, and that furthermore, other bones in the same tomb belong to his wife Cleopatra and his newly born baby. The most striking evidence comes in the form of a leg bone—an upper thigh fused to a shin at the knee with a hole in it—it appears to align with historical texts that describe Philip as suffering a wound from a lance. Additional testing showed the bone had fused and smoothed over just a few years time, which also agrees with writings from the time—Phillip was murdered just a few years after suffering the injury. Dating showed the skeletal remains to be that of man approximately 45 years old, which is consistent with the age at which Philip reportedly died. The ancient writings also describe Cleopatra as being young, approximately 18 years old at the time of her death, which occurred shortly after Phillip was killed. Dating of the other bones in the Tomb I showed them to be from a woman of just that age range. Also, the early texts describe the baby, which was killed around the same time as well. In studying the bones in Tomb II, the researchers concluded that they were entombed much later than those in Tomb I, too late for them to have been the remains of Philip. Taken together, the evidence proves that the bones in Tomb I were those of Philip, the researchers claim, suggesting that the matter has finally been settled for good.

More than 540,000 signatures will be necessary to launch a recall.As many as 100,000 people protested at the Wisconsin State Capitol on Saturday against the new curbs on public worker unions, and they greeted as returning heroes 14 Democratic lawmakers who had fled the state to stall the measure.About 70,000 protesters had massed a week earlier, before a legislative maneuver by Republicans in the senate hived off the controversial union measure from a budget bill and pushed it through without a single Democrat present.\\"You do not understand,\\" Assembly minority leader Pete Barca told the giant rally on Saturday, addressing Governor Walker. \\"Rights die hard in America.\\"Wisconsin was birthplace for some of the first U.S. unions among foundry, shoe and paper workers in the 19th century. It was the first state to pass worker compensation protections in 1911, unemployment compensation in 1932, and public employee collective bargaining rights in 1959, according to the Wisconsin Labor History Society.The new law, by contrast, strips public sector unions of collective bargaining rights except for wages, with increases limited to the level of inflation. Pay rises above inflation have to be put to a referendum of voters. Unions have to be recertified by annual votes of members and dues collected privately. Health insurance and pension contributions rise.LAWSUITS, HIGH-COURT RACE ALSO TARGETEDWisconsin in the last month became the focal point of a national debate over how to restore the finances of U.S. states and local governments struggling under a mountain of debt.Unions -- a key source of funding for Democrats -- fear the Wisconsin law will bolster Republicans in other states to cut spending by targeting public workers. Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Florida and Iowa have similar legislative moves pending.So while the Wisconsin one-year rule blocks immediate recall efforts against Walker and Republican legislators elected last November, Wisconsin Democrats and their allies are moving on multiple fronts in other ways.\\"I have never, never, never seen anything like this,\\" said Scott Becher, a former Republican legislative aide who now runs a political consulting and public relations firm outside the capital. \\"Democrats have never been more energized.\\"Democrats are circulating petitions to recall 8 Republican state senators who approved the controversial measure.Republicans currently enjoy a 19-14 advantage in the state Senate. So if Democrats can flip just three of the districts they're targeting, recalling the Republican senators and getting a Democrat elected, they can take control of the body.Democrats have also filed a complaint with the district attorney of Dane County, where the Capitol is located, charging the maneuver Republicans used to get the bill passed without a quorum in the Senate violated the state's Open Meetings law.Democrats have set their sights on the April 5 race for a 10-year term on the state's Supreme Court, where the incumbent, a Republican named David Prosser, faces a Democrat named JoAnne Kloppenburg, whose supporters have joined the protest rallies.Self-described judicial conservatives have a 4-3 majority on the state high court. So a victory in that race could help Democrats in legal challenges to Walker's anti-union measure.In a sign of how the union debate may be affecting the political calculus for Republicans, a town hall meeting in Wauwatosa on March 7 hosted by U.S. Representative James Sensenbrenner, a popular conservative Republican who represents the area in Congress, adjourned early because it was besieged by crowds opposed to Walker's measures in Madison.(Reporting by James B.

Many people did not like this and protested in the streets. The Democratic Party and some people want to remove Walker from his job, but they have to wait until next year to start that process. In the meantime, they are trying other ways to fight against the new law. The new law is important because it might inspire other states to make similar changes to how unions work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the band whose fans are described as \\"veritable teenyboppers\\"? from the following article ? Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South. When informed that the venue for their 11 September concert, the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida,...

Help as much as you can. Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who composed seven operas in three years at Brunswick? Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

This policy was met with vehement opposition from leading Republican figures, who accused him of 'Orwellian doublespeak'. President Obama's reluctance to label the global terror threat for what it is, according to his critics, reflects a total misunderstanding of the exact nature of the enemy that the free world confronts. This article will examine the criticism painted against the former President by leading Republican figures. Senator Ted Cruz, a persistent critic of Obama, blasted his 'bizarre Orwellian doublespeak' and criticized his administration's refusal to acknowledge that ISIS was an 'Islamic' terror group. According to Cruz, a refusal to acknowledge an enemy for what it is represents a dangerous misunderstanding. In the political games of semantics and connotations, the world could lose its ability to effectively combat the burgeoning problem that is terrorism, he argued. Former Texas Governor, Rick Perry, joined the fray, fiercely criticizing Obama’s rhetoric. 'Egypt and Jordan recognize that they are at war with radical Islam; isn't it about time that our president proclaimed the same?' These words point to Perry's frustration over the perceived hesitation by the Obama administration to robustly tackle the threat of ISIS terrorism. He argues that pertinent allies in the Middle East like Egypt and Jordan have already recognized the seriousness of the threat, raising ethical questions about America's leadership under the Obama administration. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush presented another critical perspective in this debate, slamming the Obama administration's stance. According to Bush, the administration was in possession of a 'total misunderstanding of what this Islamic terrorist threat is.' These remarks underscore the perception of a fundamental disconnect between Obama's understanding of the terrorist threat and its ground realities – a chasm that could have severe implications in terms of policy and action. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, meanwhile, put a more direct blame on another prominent Democratic figure – Hillary Clinton. He claimed that 'Hillary’s war in Libya allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists.' Paul’s denunciation comes with an insurgent critic of the Obama-Clinton's foreign policy and its unanticipated and disastrous consequences, which, as many argue, have largely contributed to the creation of a fertile ground for terrorism. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal provided a different perspective on the crisis. He argued against the Obama administration's foreign aid policies – saying 'We don’t need a war on international poverty; we need a war on the evil that is radical Islamic terrorism.' What the U.S. needs, Jindal suggested, is not a global effort to fight poverty, but a focused and unerring war against the actual threat – that is, radical Islamic terrorism. In conclusion, the Republican leaders' criticism of the Obama administration's terminology policy in regards to ISIS clearly reflects a fundamental difference in perception and approach towards handling the rising tide of global terrorism. The refusal of Obama, in their eyes, to label ISIS as an 'Islamic' terror group becomes symbolic of a much larger failure – that of grappling with the real nature of the threat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

Global warming is an increase in the Earth’s temperature. It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases can be released by factories that burn fossil fuels. Over the past 20 years, burning fossil fuels has produced about three-quarters of the carbon dioxide from human activity. The rest of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is there because of deforestation, or cutting down trees ( Figure below ). Trees absorb carbon dioxide during cellular respiration, so when trees are cut down, they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air.

That is what we want. Stop the bloodshed. Stop it now. We know this is a risk for you, but take this risk,\\" Huberta von Voss-Wittig, the wife of Germany's U.N. ambassador, told CNN. Speaking to CNN in interviews Tuesday and Wednesday, Voss-Wittig said the Syrian first lady \\"should get her act together\\" and \\"not worry so much about her husband but worry a little bit more about women in her country.\\" A U.N. diplomat said the video was produced by Voss-Wittig and Sheila Lyall Grant, the wife of Britain's U.N. ambassador, \\"on their own initiative.\\" Voss-Wittig stresses that the video isn't a U.N. product or \\"done by us as spouses.\\" \\"It's done by us as women who care and as women who have an international profile ourselves,\\" she said.

The United Nations estimates at least 9,000 people have died since the demonstrations began, while others put the death toll at more than 11,000. The video comes days after U.N. and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan forged what has become a fragile cease-fire. \\"We think it's a good moment now that the cease-fire has been installed.

In one e-mail exchange with an art dealer in London, she -- apparently using a false name -- inquired about six artworks that feature butterflies.

Write highlights for this article: Britain's biggest lottery winners have answered a mother's plea for help by donating almost £30,000 to pay for her three-year-old daughter to have an operation to help her walk. Chris and Colin Weir, who scooped a record £161million Euromillions jackpot in July 2011, dipped into their huge fortune to pay for spastic diplegic cerebral palsy sufferer Skye Swinton to pay for revolutionary surgery. The pair wrote a cheque after Skye's desperate mother Ruth, 38, wrote to the couple asking for help. Scroll down for video. Skye Swinton, 3, from Cheltenham pictured with her parents John and Ruth who have raised £40k for a life changing operation to help their daughter walk with the help of record Euromillions winners Colin and Chris Weir. Little Skye, pictured, who was born 13 weeks prematurely and suffers from spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, has spent much of her life in a wheelchair. She had expected her letter to be 'politely binned' but was stunned when she received a phone call telling her that the pair, from Largs in North Ayrshire, were happy to donate £28,000. Ecstatic Ruth, a former teacher and now full-time carer to Skye, said: 'It is just unbelievable and we are so delighted. 'I sent the letter months ago and so I just thought it would have been politely binned, so to get the phone call with the news was just fantastic. Born 13 weeks early and weighing a tiny 1lb 15oz, Skye's condition has left her confined to a wheelchair for much of her life. She is unsteady on her feet and unable to go any distance without tiring and dreams of walking and running like other children. Skye's family and friends managed to raise £12,000 towards their target of £40,000 but were still £28,000 short until Ruth's heartfelt letter persuaded generous Chris and Colin to part with the remainder of the cash. Skye's mother Ruth had written a desperate letter to Colin and Chris Weir asking for their help to raise £40,000 for her daughter's surgery. It is hoped that Skye, from Cheltenham Gloucestershire, will undergo delicate surgery - which involves partially cutting the nerve roots where they join the spinal cord - next summer pending vital medical assessments. An initial assessment, scans and x-rays will cost the family £800, with the operation priced at £23,500 and subsequent physiotherapy, expected to last two years, will cost around £15,000. Without surgery now, the youngster would need major orthopaedic surgery by the time she turns 10 or 11. Ruth, who is married to Skye's father John, also 38, said: 'There are still a number of medical hurdles to overcome, but now that we have raised the money we need, we can now concentrate on helping Skye reach her full potential. 'We were absolutely blown away with the support we've had, and the generosity we have been shown.' The family will continue fundraising in aid of Skye and will use the additional money to help her during her rehabilitation with planned fundraising events still to go ahead. In a statement, Mr and Mrs Weir said: 'Skye faces many challenges in the next year and she needs her mum and dad to be focused on her. That's why we've given a donation. 'Without the additional worry and pressure of fundraising, their time can be spent on Skye.' Mr and Mrs Weir have shown enormous generosity since winning their vast fortune. They donated their former £180,000 home to their neighbours after buying their new home and sponsored 15-year-old Scottish racing driver Gregor Ramsey in the European and Italian Formula 3 events. Mr Weir, a former Scottish TV cameraman, donated £750,000 to his local football team, Largs Thistle, to pay off some of the club's debt and improve facilities. Colin and Chris Weir, pictured celebrating their Euromillions win, donated £28,000 towards Skye's £40,000 operation. The pair's £161million jackpot win in July 2012 remains the largest single lottery win in the UK. In August the couple also donated a five-figure sum to buy a prosthetic limb for cancer victim Kieran Maxwell, 13, of Heighington, near Darlington. They also pledged £900,000 towards a new £1.2million multi-use sports arena in their home town and helped talented young artist Lee Craigmile pay his fees to study in Italy. Mr and Mrs Weir payed a seven figure sum to the Scottish National Party to help fund its campaign for independence from the rest of the UK. They have also personally enjoyed their winnings, applying for planning permission to build a luxury indoor swimming pool, jacuzzi and conservatory at their home. VIDEO: Celebrating in style!

Article: House buyers have three main choices: building from the ground up, moving into an old house or buying a new one. All the three are very different and should be considered carefully. Your budget will probably have the biggest effect on your choice. Comparing the three will help you make a good decision. New houses are untouched and fresh, which means they can suit your personality and you know exactly where all of the materials come from. New houses won't hold many unpleasant surprises, such as weak foundations, or other damaged areas. Most of these modern houses are also far more eco-friendly, with future decoration being just as easy to make and do as you like. Buying new houses is also a great way to save money, and you may find its benefit with the price going up in the future. Some buildings, such as those that are rare or in certain areas, are of value over the years. Sometimes it is the history that draws more buyers into older houses. A famous person may have lived there, or an important event may have taken place in the house. This may not add any value to the house, but it can add to the attraction. There may be more repairs which will need to be done in the old houses,so before you think you've found a great bargain, be sure to get a careful inspection. There are those who prefer building from the ground up. Building your own house can be a very rewarding, tiring, and expensive experience. While people have many expectations of planning and building their own houses, one thing is sure: it will take a while. There are always difficulties during construction, so you always find the construction time will be longer than your plan, not to mention the budget. Time can add up as well as materials and costs.

Solve g - 3*g - 10 = 0 for g.","completion":"To solve the equation g - 3*g - 10 = 0 for g, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The given equation is g - 3*g - 10 = 0. We have two terms with the variable g (g and -3*g). Combine these terms by subtracting 3*g from g: g - 3*g = -2*g Now, replace this in the original equation: -2*g - 10 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable g. To do this, we need to get g on one side of the equation and constants on the other side. We currently have -2*g - 10 = 0. To isolate g, first, add 10 to both sides of the equation: -2*g - 10 + 10 = 0 + 10 -2*g = 10 Next, we need to remove the -2 coefficient from the variable g. Since the operation between -2 and g is multiplication, we need to perform the opposite operation, which is division. Divide both sides of the equation by -2: (-2*g) / -2 = 10 / -2 g = -5 Step 3: Verify the solution. Substitute the value we found for g back into the original equation to ensure it holds true: g - 3*g - 10 = 0 (-5) - 3*(-5) - 10 = 0 Perform the multiplication: -5 + 15 - 10 = 0 Now, perform the addition and subtraction operations in the order they appear: 10 = 10 Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is correct. The solution for the equation g - 3*g - 10 = 0 is g = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Article: A Bite of China Season Two(<< >> ) is coming! The program is shown at 9 : 00 0n CCTV-1 every Friday night from April 18 to June 6, 2014. There are altogether eight episodes , all about history and culture of food, eating and cooking in China. The directors spent one year visiting more than 150 different parts of China. More than 300 types of food are covered in the documentary . As an old Chinese saying goes, food is what matters most to people. It plays an important role in our daily life, and the rich food culture is also one of the most important parts of Chinese culture. A Bite of China Season Two wants to show the joys and sadnesses of ordinary Chinese in changing times through food. A Bite of China Season One was shown on CCTV in 2012. It attracted more than 100 million viewers. It is all about food, while the second season cares more about the relationship between the people and the food. For example, the first episode shows a young man spent four hours climbing a 40-metre-high tree to get something nice for his brother. The show reminds viewers of their homes and the tastes of childhood. One Weibo user wrote, \\"A Bite o f China Season Two makes me have so many words to say. It makes me think of my parents and my grandmother. I haven't been home for a long time, so I have decided to go back in a few days. \\" The show uses food as a window to introduce China to the world. Viewers can see how Chinese people love life by loving food. Anyone who wants to know more about Chinese culture and Chinese society should have a bite of the program.

The answer is:","completion":"1). They will swim them back to safety. In the passage, the person is actively swimming towards someone in trouble, and by doing so they show a willingness to help in this situation. Therefore, it is likely that after reaching the person, they will attempt to swim them back to safety. 2). None of the above choices - This answer is incorrect because option 1 provides a likely outcome based on the passage. 3). They will call the authorities - This option is considered incorrect because the person has already started swimming out to help the person in trouble. As they are in the water, it would be difficult for them to call the authorities at this point. 4). They will call for help into the water - This option is incorrect because, as mentioned in the passage, the speaker is actively swimming to assist the person in trouble.
