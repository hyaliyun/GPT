Please answer the following question: This article: In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are. We are French[;] we are among the savages[;] we would like much to be Among the Christians such as we are[.] ... we are solely grieved to be among beasts like these who believe neither in God nor in anything.

A:","completion":"The review depicted for the C-IN2 Men's Underwear Contour Pouch Brief can be considered as both flattering and unflattering. Let's break down the review to better understand this. Flattering aspects: 1. The reviewer mentions that they really like the briefs. This implies that the product has an appealing design, quality, and overall appearance, which could potentially attract prospective buyers. 2. The fact that the reviewer took the time to write a review about the product suggests that they care about sharing their experience and opinion, indicating a level of satisfaction with the purchase. Unflattering aspects: 1. The main issue that the reviewer has with the product is the sizing, stating that the small size feels more like an extra-small. This can be considered unflattering as it may suggest inconsistencies in the sizing chart or a lack of accurate representation for customer expectations. This could deter potential buyers who are particular about the fit and comfort of their underwear. 2. While the review briefly addresses the sizing issue in one specific color (grey), it does not mention whether the same issue is present with other colors, leaving room for uncertainty and possible hesitation in potential customers. In summary, while the review does provide some praise for the C-IN2 Men's Underwear Contour Pouch Brief, the sizing issue could be seen as a significant drawback for potential buyers, casting the product in both a flattering and unflattering light.

Paragraph: Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

The correct answer is \\"no.\\" The main country that influenced Japan in the region, according to the paragraph, was China. Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society, and many Japanese monks, scholars, and artists studied Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting. The paragraph mentions Christianity and Northern Europe as a comparison to illustrate how another religion (Christianity) brought a different culture to a different region (Northern Europe) but does not state that Northern Europe influenced Japan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Audubon Woodlore goes out on the lake to check on the anglers. Humphrey the Bear is trying to catch some fish, but cannot seem to hold onto one once he catches it. Woodlore sees the fish disappearing before his eyes, so he decides to stock the lake some more. As he heads to the fish hatchery, he sees Humphrey with a few fishing nets and rods, and asks him what he is doing. When the bear tells him that he is going to catch some fish, Woodlore takes the rods and nets and tells him to \\"Go fish like a bear!\\" At the hatchery, Woodlore selects an envelope of fish eggs from a collection of eggs from such trout species as dolly vardens and rainbows. He fills a tub with water and inserts the eggs into it. In a matter of seconds, several fishes pop up out of the water like plants out of soil. When the ranger gets to the lake to dump the fish, he finds Humphrey in there, trying to eat one of the small fishes, which is then consumed by a much larger fish. Humphrey manages to remove the small fish from the mouth of the large fish, and then uses it to lure five other large fishes that jump out of the water, but then Woodlore appears to measure the fish, while at the same time punishing Humphrey by hitting him on the head, causing him to sink into the depths of the lake. When Humphrey grabs some more fish and emerges from the lake, he discovers a fish larger than any of the others; this turns out to be a fish balloon with which a young boy is playing.

He is the son of April (Gholson) Tucker, who was seventeen when he was born, and Claude Neverson Jr. Raised as a military brat by his mother and stepfather, Songz did not have aspirations for a musical career as a child due to his shyness, saying \\"Singing wasn't a reality for me, until other people started noticing I sounded good.\\" He recognized his vocal abilities at the age of 14. While recording his debut album in 2004, Songz released multiple mixtapes under the alias Prince of Virginia. One of the mixtapes featured an \\"answer track\\" to R. Kelly's \\"Trapped in the Closet\\", entitled \\"Open the Closet\\". The song gave Songz some notoriety. His debut album, I Gotta Make It was released on July 26, 2005. It debuted at #20 on the Billboard 200, selling 40,000 copies in its first week of sales. It has sold 300,000 records in the US. Songz's debut single, Gotta Make It, featuring Twista, was released in March 2005 and reached #87 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #21 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. It garnered success in the R&B/urban community but failed to make a mark in mainstream music. The album's second and final single, Gotta Go, was released in July 2005 and reached #67 on the Hot 100 and #11 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming even more successful than his debut single in the R&B/urban community and in the mainstream community. After promotion for his debut concluded, he was featured on the lead single from Twista's fifth album, The Day After. The single, \\"Girl Tonite\\", reached #14 on the Hot 100 and #3 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming a huge hit. In mid-2006, Songz began work on a follow-up album to his debut with longtime collaborator Troy Taylor and also employed successful Bryan-Michael Cox, Danja, Stargate and R. Kelly to help create the album. Trey aimed for the album to be more mainstream-oriented than his debut album. His second studio album, Trey Day, was released on October 2, 2007. The album reached #11 on the Billboard 200, selling 73,000 copies in its first week. It has since sold 400,000 records in the US, becoming his second album not to be certified by the RIAA. The album was going to be released on May 8, 2007, but was continually delayed in order for a successful single to precede the album, as the lead single failed to impact charts. His second album was preceded by the lead single, \\"Wonder Woman\\", which was released in February 2007. It reached #54 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, but failed to impact the Hot 100. Because of the single's failure, his second album was delayed from May 2007 to October 2007. The album's second single, \\"Can't Help but Wait\\", was released in August 2007 and was released to promote his second album and the film Step Up 2 the Streets soundtrack as a single for it. The single reached #14 on the Hot 100, and #2 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It became Songz's first Top 20 hit on the Hot 100, and helped to boost his second album's sales.

Although the term may encompass entities such as courts and prisons, it is most frequently applied to those who directly engage in patrols or surveillance to dissuade and discover criminal activity, and those who investigate crimes and apprehend offenders, a task typically carried out by the police or another law enforcement agency. Furthermore, although law enforcement may be most concerned with the prevention and punishment of crimes, organizations exist to discourage a wide variety of non-criminal violations of rules and norms, effected through the imposition of less severe consequences. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.

Founding of International Karate Organization / Kyokushinkaikan. After formally establishing the Kyokushinkaikan in 1964, Oyama directed the organization through a period of expansion. Oyama hand-picked instructors who displayed ability in marketing the style and gaining new members. Oyama would choose an instructor to open a new dojo. The instructor would move to that town and demonstrate his karate skills in public places. After that, word of mouth would spread through the local area until the dojo had a dedicated core of students. Oyama also sent instructors to other countries such as the Netherlands (Kenji Kurosaki), Australia (Shigeo Kato) and (Mamoru Kaneko), the United States of America (Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama, Miyuki Miura), Great Britain (Steve Arneil), Canada (Tatsuji Nakamura) and Brazil (Seiji Isobe) to spread Kyokushin in the same way. Many students, including Jon Bluming, Steve Arneil, and Howard Collins, traveled to Japan to train with Oyama directly. In 1969, Oyama staged \\"The First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" and Terutomo Yamazaki became the first champion. All-Japan Championships have been held at every year.

This important river in the southeastern United States begins its journey in the Blue Ridge Mountains, specifically at the Chattahoochee Spring in Jacks Knob, Georgia, which is at an elevation of about 3,500 feet. The river travels approximately 430 miles (690 kilometers) before merging with the Flint River to form the Apalachicola River at the Florida border, which eventually empties into the Gulf of Mexico. Throughout its long course, the Chattahoochee River flows through a variety of landscapes, including forests, urban areas, and agricultural lands. Once it leaves the northern Georgia mountains, it flows through the Atlanta metropolitan area, making it an essential source of drinking water for millions of people. It then continues to course through western Georgia and eastern Alabama, providing water for numerous communities, industries, as well as agricultural and recreational activities. The Chattahoochee River plays a significant role in the ecology of the region. It supports a diverse range of habitats and ecosystems, fostering a healthy environment for numerous flora and fauna species to thrive. That includes many species of fish, such as striped bass, largemouth bass, and catfish, which have crucial ecological and economic value. A variety of recreational activities take place along the Chattahoochee River, including fishing, boating, and whitewater rafting. There are also several parks, walking trails, and protected areas along its banks, encouraging locals and visitors to engage in outdoor adventures and appreciate the river's natural beauty. The river has a rich history and cultural significance, too. Native Americans, like the Creek and Cherokee peoples, once inhabited the lands surrounding the Chattahoochee River, where they relied on the river as a vital source of water, food, and transportation. Additionally, the region witnessed significant events during the American Civil War. In summary, the Chattahoochee River, which forms the border between Georgia and Alabama, plays a vital role in various aspects, including the supply of drinking water, supporting ecosystems, recreational activities, and reflecting cultural heritage, making it an invaluable resource for the southeastern United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Di Maria started superbly but has struggled with injuries in England. Louis van Gaal has played him as a striker in recent weeks. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Angel Di Maria's Journey From £60m Real Madrid Sensation to Struggling Manchester United Star Subtitle: Argentine winger's performance in recent 0-0 draw against Cambridge United sparks concern As Manchester United went head to head against Cambridge United on Friday night, a draw that ended in a goalless tie, speculations surrounding Angel Di Maria's form continue to arise. The Argentine winger struggled throughout the match, with one of his many shots ballooning out of the stadium. This has led to questions about Di Maria's position at the club, as well as the adjustments being made by United's manager, Louis van Gaal, who has been playing him as a striker in recent weeks. The 27-year-old Angel Di Maria was signed for a whopping £60m from the elite European club, Real Madrid last summer, making him the most expensive signing in the history of Manchester United. Upon his arrival in England, the Argentine international was widely regarded as one of the best football players in the world, having played an instrumental role in Real Madrid's famous 'La Decima' Champions League triumph. Di Maria started his Manchester United career superbly, scoring three goals and providing four assists in his first five appearances for the club. Unfortunately, injuries have plagued Di Maria's time in England. The winger has been in and out of the United line-up since his arrival and as a result, has struggled to find the kind of form that gained him a big-money move to Old Trafford. As the Premier League season advanced, Di Maria's performances began to falter. His inconsistent form drew criticisms from both fans and pundits alike, with some even suggesting that he has not lived up to his massive price tag. As a result, United manager Louis van Gaal decided to experiment with Di Maria's position on the field, opting to play him as a forward rather than in his preferred wide role. In the recent match against Cambridge United, Di Maria failed to make the desired impact. He repeatedly lost possession, missed goal-scoring opportunities and topped it off with an embarrassing shot that went way off target. While it may be only one match, this performance highlighted the issues surrounding Di Maria's form and begs the question - is he being properly utilized, or has he just failed to adapt to English football? Some argue that the change in position is to be blamed for Di Maria's recent struggles, pointing out that the Argentine star performed best when playing as a winger. They believe that Louis van Gaal's decision to play him as a striker is a direct cause of his decline in form, as the position may not suit the strengths of Di Maria's game. Others opine that Di Maria's inability to stay fit for long periods has had a significant effect on his performance. Injuries have forced him to miss key matches, and the lack of a consistent run of games has made it difficult for him to establish a steady form. In conclusion, Angel Di Maria's struggles in recent times can be attributed to various factors, including his change in position and a history of injuries. While it remains to be seen whether the Argentine winger would eventually adapt to the English game and truly live up to his £60m price tag, one thing is certain - Manchester United fans, as well as football enthusiasts, would be hoping that Di Maria rediscovers his sensational form to reclaim his position as one of the best football players in the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We were seated right away in the dark downstairs dining room, where the walls are lined with wood, and the wood is lined with wine bottles. Our seating was comfortable, and not too close to the table next to us (relief). The restaurant didn't seem incredibly busy - comfortably populated, but a few empty tables scattered around. You might not even need a reservation. Our server was very casual, in his dress and demeanor (jeans and black button downs seem to be the uniform). His interactions with us were a little lax, a little moreso than I expected, given that it's a somewhat pricey joint, but he was knowledgeable and happy to give recommendations, which is always appreciated. The menu changes daily, so there are no specials. Everything is a special, in that sense. The wine list, printed on the back, was absolutely delightful since almost every bottle can be ordered in a taster portion, a half glass, a full glass, or a bottle. Lovely! I ordered three tasters throughout the evening, and it was such a fun experience. We drank white with our appetizers, red for dinner, and sparkling for dessert. I was never too drunk or too full of wine, the price was great, the taster portions were more generous than I expected, and I got to try five kinds of wine. Hard to beat. We had a Montravel from Spain, which my boyfriend loved, and their Riesling, which I loved. Both wines were flavorful and unique, and it was a truly great experience to have excellent wine again, compared to our usual bottles purchased cheaply from the store. Our appetizers were the Mac and Cheese (goat cheese, local sausage, and a fried egg in the dish), and the Stuffed Poblano Peppers. The Mac 'n' Cheese was good, creamy but not too heavy, and the pasta was orzo which was fun. But the Peppers - just to die for. To. Die. They had been roasted, it seems, or grilled, and were filled with the most flavorful housemade pork sausage. We were both bowled over. If this is on the menu, don't miss it. Their sausage is the real deal. Next we got two tasters of red, the Cotes-du-Rhone and something else....also very uniquely flavored and rich wines. Our entrees were the Suckling Pig and the Hanger Steak. The steak was my favorite - cooked to a delightful medium rare and served with roasted potatoes and rutabegas, it was simple and unpretentious. Great beef flavor, nothing too intrusive or unusual. Just high quality food. The pig was good as well - the texture was divine, soft and reminiscent of pulled pork only better. The sweet potato mash alongside was great. My only complaint was the sauce was, in my opinion, too salty. Anything it touched became too salty, and the sweet potato mash was needed to cut through that sodium taste. I think it bothered me more than it bothered my boyfriend. We absolutely finished both plates, practically licking them clean, but I'd watch out for that sauce if you're sensitive to salt. For dessert I had a glass of moscato, sweet and lovely, and we split the \\"peanut butter ice cream sandwich\\" which seemed more like a peanut butter pie, but who's complaining? It was very good and a great end to the meal. All this for about 75. The way they price their wines makes all the difference, and a great meal instantly becomes much more affordable than you'd expect. I'd recommend Toast! to anyone, especially wine lovers.

Dahası, bölgesel pazarın WTO yönetmelikleri ve ikili anlaşmalar yoluyla serbestleştirilmesi, şu anda son derece düşük olan doğrudan dış yatırım seviyesini de yükseltecek. Translate this to English?","completion":"Furthermore, the liberalization of the regional market through WTO regulations and bilateral agreements will also increase the level of foreign direct investment, which is currently extremely low. In addition to the translation, it is essential to understand the context and implications of this statement. The sentence talks about the benefits of liberalizing a regional market and how it promotes increased foreign direct investment (FDI). The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that sets global trade rules and helps its member countries negotiate trade agreements. One of the main objectives of the WTO is to facilitate international trade and reduce barriers. Liberalization refers to the process of removing various restrictions and regulations that govern international trade, ideally making a market more open and competitive. This can take the form of reducing import tariffs, eliminating export subsidies, or lifting restrictions like quotas and licenses. Doing so allows companies from different countries to enter new markets easily, create jobs, and foster economic growth. FDI is a form of investment where a company or individual from one country acquires substantial ownership or control in a company based in another country. High levels of FDI indicate strong investor confidence, a healthy business environment, and a stable political climate. When foreign companies invest in a regional market, they bring capital, technology, know-how, and best practices from their home country, which can significantly contribute to the growth and development of the host country. The statement highlights the potential growth in FDI in the region as a result of the liberalization of the market through WTO regulations and bilateral agreements. Bilateral agreements are those made between two countries, often covering trade, economic cooperation, and other areas of mutual interest. Countries negotiate their trade rules and tariffs, aiming for reduced trade barriers in these agreements, which can further promote investment and diversify their economies. In short, by adhering to WTO regulations and fostering bilateral agreements, countries can encourage the inflow of foreign investment, which in turn strengthens the overall economy and drives development."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 2: Do teachers or professors look down on students who score low on test? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing, which is whether teachers or professors have a negative perception of students who score low on tests or have lower academic performance in general. To provide a detailed and long answer about this particular topic, it is important to acknowledge that teachers and professors have varying opinions of students based on their professional experience, teaching philosophy, and level of interaction with the students. 1. Empathetic Teachers: Many teachers recognize the fact that not all students have the same aptitude for learning and may perform poorly on tests. Such teachers often adopt the role of mentors, focusing on the growth and development of the student as an individual. They look for ways to improve the students' academic performance in the long term by suggesting different study strategies, offering supplementary materials for learning, or encouraging the student to seek help from tutors or other support resources. 2. Teachers With High Expectations: Some teachers may have higher expectations from their students as a way to challenge and push them to achieve greater academic success. While they may not necessarily look down on low-scoring students, these teachers may express disappointment if a student is not living up to their potential or not putting in enough effort. They believe that setting high expectations will help students strive for better results. 3. Objectivity and Fairness: A majority of teachers and professors strive for objectivity and fairness when assessing student performance. These educators are aware that every student has different strengths and weaknesses, learning styles, and backgrounds. They understand that low test scores may not necessarily indicate a lack of intelligence but could instead imply a struggling communication of knowledge and application. 4. Teachers Considering External Factors: Teachers are often aware that students may encounter situations outside of school that can affect their performance. These can include personal issues, family problems, or even health issues. Some educators try to be empathetic towards struggling students and offer support beyond the classroom, such as counseling or peer mentorship programs, to help the student overcome external challenges that may be causing their low scores. 5. Impact of Education System and Standardized Testing: The education system and standardized testing can sometimes cause teachers to judge their students based on test scores or academic performance because these metrics are quantifiable and easy to analyze. This may unintentionally lead some teachers to look down on low-scoring students due to a perceived lack of effort, intelligence, or motivation. In summary, while there may be instances where some teachers or professors look down on students with low test scores, most educators approach student performance with objectivity, empathy, high expectations, and an understanding of external factors influencing their students' lives. As teaching philosophies continue to evolve, there are increasing efforts to evaluate student progress via comprehensive and holistic methods to provide more accurate assessments and foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As we proceeded with the building project, it became more and more evident that a hammer was essential for our needs. The drill, although a valuable tool for some tasks, simply did not provide the versatility and necessary functions that the hammer could. The hammer allowed us to tackle a range of tasks, such as driving nails into various materials like wood or drywall, which were vital components in our building project. Additionally, the ability to dismantle and remove nails seamlessly was a crucial aspect for a successful project. A hammer, with its flat head, could easily get underneath a nail head and pull it out with minimal effort, making it an indispensable tool when adjustments and corrections were required. Moreover, a hammer was an effective tool for wedging and tapping items into place. During the building process, it was often necessary to make sure that the components of our structure were securely fixed and properly aligned. The hammer was the perfect tool for this purpose, as it allowed us to apply force to any part of the structure requiring a tighter connection. Versatility was another factor that made a hammer essential for our project. It proved to be useful in various stages, from the beginning of the construction process to the end. Whether we were framing walls, securing roofing materials, or installing fasteners, the hammer remained one of the most relied-upon tools we possessed. Furthermore, it became apparent that the shape and design of the hammer were highly advantageous. The curved claw on the back enabled us to extract nails efficiently, while the sturdy handle provided a comfortable grip, allowing for maximum control and precision. In contrast, the drill was not well-suited for our building project. While it excelled in drilling holes and driving screws, it simply did not have the ability nor the versatility that the hammer possessed. Drilling holes was a limited function in the context of our project, and the lack of adaptability with the tasks at hand rendered it an inessential tool. As the project progressed, the decision to exchange the drill for a hammer proved to be a wise choice. The numerous advantages of the hammer, coupled with its adaptability, made it an indispensable component of our toolkit, allowing us to complete our building project in a timely and efficient manner. Choosing the proper tool for the task at hand, in this case, opting for a hammer instead of a drill, ensured a smoother and more successful building process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bruce Randall Hornsby (born November 23, 1954) is an American singer and pianist. Hornsby draws frequently from classical, jazz, bluegrass, folk, Motown, gospel, rock, blues, and jam band musical traditions. Hornsby's recordings have been recognized on a number of occasions with industry awards, including the 1987 Grammy Award for Best New Artist with Bruce Hornsby and the Range, the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album, and the 1994 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. Hornsby has also achieved recognition for his solo albums and performances, his touring band Bruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers, his bluegrass project with Ricky Skaggs and his appearances as a session and guest musician. Bruce Randall Hornsby was born in Williamsburg, Virginia, a son of Robert Stanley Hornsby (1920-1998), an attorney, real-estate developer and former musician, and his wife, nee Lois Saunier. Raised a Christian Scientist, he has two siblings: Robert Saunier \\"Bobby\\" Hornsby, a realtor with Hornsby Realty and locally known musician, and Jonathan Bigelow Hornsby, an engineer who has collaborated in songwriting. He graduated from James Blair High School in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1973, where he played on the basketball team. He studied music at the University of Richmond, as well as Berklee College of Music and the University of Miami, from which he graduated in 1977. In the spring of 1974 Hornsby's older brother Bobby, who attended the University of Virginia, formed the band \\"Bobby Hi-Test and the Octane Kids\\" to play fraternity parties, featuring Bruce on Fender Rhodes and vocals. The band, which is listed in Skeleton Key: A Dictionary for Deadheads, performed covers of Allman Brothers Band, The Band, and predominantly Grateful Dead songs. Although Hornsby's collaboration with Bobby Hornsby would be relatively short-lived, Bobby's son R.S. was a recurring guest-guitarist with Hornsby's band and periodically toured with his uncle. His performances were often looked forward to by fans. R.S. Hornsby died on January 15, 2009 in a car accident near Crozet, Virginia. He was 28. Following his graduation from the University of Miami, in 1977, Hornsby returned to his hometown of Williamsburg, and played in local clubs and hotel bars. In 1980, he and his younger brother (and songwriting partner) John Hornsby moved to Los Angeles, where they spent three years writing for 20th Century Fox. Before moving back to his native southeastern Virginia, he also spent time in Los Angeles as a session musician. In 1982 Hornsby joined the band Ambrosia for their last album Road Island and can be seen in the band's video for the album's single \\"How Can You Love Me.\\" After Ambrosia disbanded, he and bassist Joe Puerta performed as members of the touring band for pop star Sheena Easton. Hornsby can clearly be seen in the music video for Easton's 1984 hit single \\"Strut.\\"","completion":"This text is about Bruce Randall Hornsby, an American singer and pianist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village was less thoughtful about the environment? Answer:","completion":"The village that demonstrated less thoughtfulness about the environment, based on the information given in the paragraph, is the village of Forx. This conclusion can be drawn from the statement that explicitly mentions that they decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes due to its profitability, but did not consider the potential impact this activity could have on the environment. On the other hand, the village of Davin, continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, both of which have potential environmental effects, yet the paragraph does not denote whether or not they considered these effects. However, the criticism towards Davin is not as direct as it was towards Forx, which leads us to believe that Forx was less thoughtful about the environment. Sand mining can lead to significant environmental damage. The process typically involves removing massive amounts of sand from a particular area, which can lead to erosion, changes in local ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, and potentially, the destruction of the homes of local wildlife. In coastal regions, sand mining can also lead to the depletion of protective beachfront sand dunes, which can increase the risk of flooding and storm damage to the community, accelerating coastal erosion and increasing the likelihood of damaging storm surges. On the contrary, commercial fishing and agriculture, while capable of causing environmental harm, have methods that can be followed to lessen that impact. This includes practices like sustainable fishing, where the population of the targeted species is allowed to maintain a healthy level, and the use of fishing techniques that do not unnecessarily harm other marine life. Similarly, sustainable farming practices can be employed that help reduce environmental harm - including rotating crops to keep the soil healthy, using natural fertilizers and pest control methods, and preventing runoff into local water sources. The absence of any explicit assertion in the paragraph that these steps were not taken by the village of Davin lets us draw the conclusion that Forx was less considerate towards the environment in their activities."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z? ? \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" was written by Beyoncé, Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash, Thaddis \\"Kuk\\" Harrell, and Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\".

Hunter wanted Nelson to try the sweet lime because","completion":"Hunter knew that Nelson had always enjoyed flavors that leaned more towards the sweeter side, and he felt that the sweet lime would be an exceptional choice for Nelson to explore. Sweet limes, being less sour and bitter than the usual limes, would cater to Nelson's taste buds much better than the conventional variety. Hunter had always noticed that Nelson would tend to avoid sour and tangy flavors, as they were too sharp for his liking. In most social gatherings or while dining out, Nelson would tend to gravitate towards milder and sweeter food and beverages. This made Hunter quite confident that introducing the sweet lime to his friend might turn out to be a pleasant surprise and a newfound favorite for Nelson. Hunter knew that the sweet lime, with its lower acidity and higher natural sugar content, would be more in tune with Nelson's preferences. Having an entirely distinct flavor profile from the common lime, the sweet lime would exempt Nelson from experiencing the puckering sensation and the ever so subtle sense of discomfort that comes with the consumption of sour foods. Moreover, introducing the sweet lime to Nelson would not only provide him the opportunity to experience a new taste but also the chance to add a healthy and refreshing fruit to his diet. Sweet limes are known for being packed with essential nutrients such as Vitamin C, potassium, and antioxidants. By promoting the sweet lime, Hunter, in turn, was motivated by the desire to contribute to the overall well-being of his dear friend Nelson. In conclusion, Hunter wanted Nelson to try the sweet lime because he believed it would be much more enjoyable and palatable for Nelson, given its less sour flavor profile and numerous health benefits. Having observed Nelson's inclination towards sweet flavors, and his aversion to the sour ones, Hunter was convinced that the sweet lime would be a delightful addition to Nelson's culinary world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Police believe that cash was generated through overseas organised crime - including Ponzi schemes - and on foreign exchange markets, before it was laundered through the man's company bank account.

I think this book is great! Is this product review negative? A:","completion":"Based on the information given in the product review, the assessment of the review is as follows: The title of the review, \\"Very cute-we love it,\\" demonstrates a positive reaction to the product. The use of the term \\"very cute\\" suggests an affectionate and possibly endearing attitude towards the book. Moreover, the phrase \\"we love it\\" clearly signifies the reviewer's favorable opinion. Within the review itself, there are several elements that indicate a positive sentiment: 1. The reviewer mentions the book was a gift from their son's grandmother, which creates a sense of fondness and familial connection.

(Evan Vucci-AP) The preseason is halfway over, but questions around the NFL may be growing rather than diminishing. Here are 10 things we’re not sure of heading into Week 3: If the Browns have a starting QB: Veteran Brian Hoyer had an opportunity to lock up the job Monday. Rookie Johnny Manziel had a shot to bolster his own case. Both failed in an ugly performance at Washington as each passer — and the Cleveland offense generally — looked way out of sorts … except when rookie QB Connor Shaw was taking the snaps (and we don’t think coach Mike Pettine will pick him). Said Hoyer: “It probably couldn’t have been any worse.” Said Manziel: “I don’t think I did a very good job today.” Wouldn’t be a surprise if Pettine deviates from his roadmap and lets this competition play out another week. FOR THE WIN: Manziel flips Redskins the bird If the Eagles defense is fixed: No NFL D was on the field longer, faced more plays or surrendered more passing yards than Philadelphia’s in 2013. Drafting OLB Marcus Smith in Round 1 and signing S Malcolm Jenkins were moves designed to alleviate the issues. But the pudding is showing no proof. Yes, preseason stats must be taken with many grains of salt, but the Eagles have allowed nearly 1,000 yards in two games, are failing to get off the field on third down more than 60% of the time and allowing opponents to hold the ball for nearly 40 minutes. Uh oh. If anyone has explained the no-dunking rule to Jimmy Graham in more detail: Don’t slam the ball over the crossbar, or your team loses 15 yards. Simple enough, right? But Graham didn’t care to abide by the new NFL policy Friday on either of his TD catches. However it sounds like coach Sean Payton has subsequently made himself loud and clear, and that Graham probably won’t be flushing any more footballs, preseason or not. Right, Jimmy? “I can’t guarantee you that, but I would never do anything to hurt this team,” Graham said. Bengals WR Mohamed Sanu glides by Jets CB Kyle Wilson for a TD. (Andrew Weber-USA TODAY Sports) If the Jets can survive with this secondary: Rex Ryan’s beloved defense is badly depleted at corner with Dee Milliner’s ankle of primary concern. Bengals QB Andy Dalton torched New York for a perfect 158.3 rating (8-for-8, 144 yards, TD) Saturday. That has to give Ryan night sweats since he knows the Jets face Matt Schaub, Aaron Rodgers, Jay Cutler, Matthew Stafford, Philip Rivers, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady in their first seven regular-season contests. If the Giants can survive with this offense: QB Eli Manning has 49 passing yards — in three preseason games. He’s completed seven passes. He’s been sacked three times. The Giants are breaking in new backs, young wideouts, a rebuilt O-line and (most importantly) new coordinator Ben McAdoo’s system. A lot of moving parts that aren’t close to clicking. Jags QB Blake Bortles was the No. 3 pick in May’s NFL draft. (Dennis Wierzbicki-USA TODAY Sports) If Blake Bortles will keep that redshirt: The Jaguars want to adhere to their plan of playing veteran QB Chad Henne for the entire 2014 season. But no rookie has consistently shown more poise and production this preseason than Bortles, the first passer picked in May’s draft. That’s still no reason to rush him into the lineup, but the Jags have to feel better about the prospect of potentially breaking the seal this season if Henne can’t tread water. (And the same can be said of Vikings rookie QB Teddy Bridgewater, who ripped up the Cardinals backups Saturday to the tune of 177 yards and two TDs in the second half.) Who are the Houston Texans? They got blown out 32-0 by a playoff-caliber squad (Cardinals) one week and blew out a playoff-caliber squad (Falcons) 32-7 the next. Again, it’s just preseason — and Houston RB Arian Foster and WR Andre Johnson have yet to suit up — but don’t be surprised if this team finds a way to look pretty good on the way to 8-9 wins and pretty ugly in 7-8 losses. Houston is talented enough to be in the wild-card scrum by season’s end. If the Chargers and 49ers are as bad as they appeared in Week 2: Collectively, they lost to the Seahawks and Broncos, respectively, 75-14. But San Diego QB Philip Rivers played one series at CenturyLink Field while San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick was in for two during his first game at brand new Levi’s Stadium. More importantly, the Bolts and Seahawks meet in Week 2 of the regular season, while the Niners and Broncos reunite in Week 7. Safe to assume that none of these 2013 playoff teams wanted to tip their hands with those far more important rematches on the horizon, so probably also safe to not overanalyze the weekend blowouts. If the Titans still consider WR Justin Hunter a ‘JAG': Or “just a guy,” which appeared on his practice jersey last week. But following a four-catch, 111-yard game in New Orleans — which included a 64-yard catch-and-run score and beautiful high-wire job on the boundary for another TD — Hunter may be settling in as “just a great” weapon for Tennessee in his second pro campaign. Titans WR Justin Hunter gets his toes down for one of his Friday night TDs in New Orleans. (Bill Haber-AP) If Travis Kelce still qualifies as a fantasy sleeper: The Chiefs’ second-year tight end may have remained somewhat anonymous despite a 69-yard TD in the preseason’s opening week. That was before he added a 43-yard score on national TV Sunday night. With an injury-marred rookie year behind him, Kelce could be the seam-strafing weapon the K.C. offense could so clearly use … and maybe a no-longer-secret weapon for fantasy GMs across the nation. Brian Hoyer, Browns, Houston Texans, Johnny Manziel, New York Giants, New York Jets, NFL preseason Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The preseason of the NFL continues with many questions remaining unanswered, such as the starting quarterback for the Browns and if the Eagles defense has improved.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Alicia Augello Cook (born January 25, 1981), known professionally as Alicia Keys, is an American singer-songwriter, pianist, music producer, philanthropist, and actress. Keys released her debut album, Songs in A Minor in 2001 with J Records, having had previous record deals first with Columbia and then Arista Records. Songs in A Minor produced her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \\"Fallin'\\", and sold over 12 million copies worldwide. The album earned Keys five Grammy Awards in 2002. Following Davis to his newly formed J Records label, she worked with Kerry \\"Krucial\\" Brothers and recorded the songs \\"Rock wit U\\" and \\"Rear View Mirror\\", which were featured on the soundtracks to the films Shaft (2000) and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), respectively. Keys' first studio album Songs in A Minor was released in June 2001. Musically, it incorporated classical piano in an R&B, soul and jazz album. Jane Stevenson of Jam! described the music as \\"old-school urban sounds and attitude set against a backdrop of classical piano and sweet, warm vocals\\". USA Today's Steve Jones wrote that Keys \\"taps into the blues, soul, jazz and even classical music to propel haunting melodies and hard-driving funk\\". Debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 236,000 units, it went on to sell over 6.2 million copies in the United States and 12 million copies internationally. Additionally, it was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Songs in A Minor established Keys' popularity both inside and outside of the United States where she became the best-selling new artist and R&B artist of the year. The album's release was preceded by the April release of her debut single, \\"Fallin'\\", which spent six weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. The album's second single, \\"A Woman's Worth\\", was released in February 2002 and peaked at seven on the Hot 100 and number three on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs; becoming her second top ten single on both charts. Released in June, \\"How Come You Don't Call Me\\" served as the album's third single, peaking at 59 on the Hot 100. The album's fourth single \\"Girlfriend\\" was released in the United Kingdom where it peaked at 82. The following year, the album was reissued as Remixed & Unplugged in A Minor, which included eight remixes and seven unplugged versions of the songs from the original. Songs in A Minor led Keys to win five awards at the 2002 Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best R&B Song for \\"Fallin'\\", Best New Artist, and Best R&B Album; \\"Fallin'\\" was also nominated for Record of the Year. Keys became the second female solo artist to win five Grammy Awards in a single night, following Lauryn Hill at the 41st Grammy Awards. That same year, she collaborated with Christina Aguilera for the latter's upcoming album Stripped on a song titled \\"Impossible\\", which Keys wrote, co-produced, and provided with background vocals. During the early 2000s, Keys also made small cameos in television series Charmed and American Dreams.

Cincinnati scored first on a 22-yard TD pass to wide receiver Kelley Washington from Carson Palmer. The Browns responded with a 30-yard FG by kicker Phil Dawson. The Bengals extended their lead with an 8-yard TD pass to wide receiver Chad Johnson. In the second quarter, kicker Shayne Graham made a 37-yard field goal as time ran out to give Cincinnati a 17-3 halftime lead. In the fourth quarter, Graham would give the Bengals a 37-yard field goal, and the Browns responded with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Reuben Droughns. Two touchdown runs by Bengal running back Rudi Johnson put the game out of reach. The Browns scored one more touchdown with quarterback Charlie Frye's 2-yard run, but it was not enough as the Bengals improved to 2-0. Several Bengals were injured during this game. David Pollack, a 2nd year linebacker, suffered a non-paralyzing broken neck (fracturing his C6 vertebra), and would miss the rest of the season. Safety Dexter Jackson suffered a severe ankle sprain. Center Rich Braham also suffered a leg injury, and was expected to be out for some weeks. Wide receiver, Chad Johnson appeared dinged up too. On his 8-yard touchdown reception, he appeared to have an injured shoulder (made noticeable by his unenthusiastic post-score celebratory dance). Even though he continued to play, he appeared to be in pain. Later in the game, during a Browns interception, he was blocked by a Brown's safety, which gave him a concussion. Special team starter, Tab Perry, injured his hip, and missed a number of games.

On a scale from 0-5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\", how similar is the sentence \\"Conmen dressed as women steal cash\\" to the sentence \\"CCTV: York conmen dress as women to trick pensioners\\"?","completion":"In terms of similarity, the two sentences could be rated as 4 on a scale from 0 to 5. Both sentences discuss the same subject matter: the action of conmen using deceptive appearances, specifically dressed as women, to commit their crimes. This main theme is central to both sentences, making them largely similar. Sentence 1, \\"Conmen dressed as women steal cash,\\" is a short, concise statement. It outlines a crime committed by conmen, who dress as women to steal money. However, the victims, the location, or the proof are left unspecified. Sentence 2, \\"CCTV: York conmen dress as women to trick pensioners,\\" provides more specific details about the same subject. It adds that there is CCTV footage of the incident. It also places the conmen in a specific location (York) and reveals the victims of the crime (pensioners). This sentence contains the same base information as the first one but offers additional knowledge about the circumstances of the crime. However, the slight differences in the specificity of the details mentioned in the second statement (CCTV footage, location, and specific victims, which are pensioners) are what pushes the similarity rating down from a perfect 5 to a 4.

The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Write a text based on this summary: india 's economy plan fails to convince analysts Text:","completion":"Title: India's Aspiration for Economic Stabilization Falls Short of Analyst Expectations In recent years, India has asserted itself as a major player on the global economic stage, attempting to compete with established economies such as China and the United States. However, their latest economic plan, which comprises a series of reforms and initiatives aimed at stimulating growth, appears to have largely failed to convince analysts. Many question the feasibility and effectiveness of these proposals in addressing the structural issues plaguing the nation's burgeoning economy. In this article, we will delve deeper into the reasons behind this prevailing skepticism among financial experts. The recent release of India's economic blueprint featured several ambitious strategies to tackle pertinent challenges such as inflation, unemployment, and the massive informal sector, which has been a constant thorn in the side of the Indian government. Key highlights of the plan include encouraging foreign direct investment, increasing digitalization, and advancing infrastructural projects. On paper, these policies seem promising; however, analysts point out that the devil lies in the details - or rather, the lack thereof. One significant concern for market experts is the lack of concrete action plans accompanying these broad initiatives. According to them, the Indian government has outlined numerous grandiose objectives but has not provided clear strategies or timelines on how these aims will be achieved. This reluctance to outline quantitative targets has further stoked the fires of skepticism among economists, hindering the credibility of the plan. Another crucial issue hindering the success of India's economic plan is the enduring bureaucracy and regulatory hassles that have long plagued the nation. Foreign investors are often deterred by the excessive red tape and corruption, which stifles business growth. While the newest blueprint has promised to relax regulations and improve the ease of doing business, past governments have made similar assurances with little to no tangible progress. There is, therefore, little reason for analysts to believe that the present government can enact any meaningful change in this area. Additionally, the plan's focus on digitalization has raised eyebrows among economic experts. Although increased digitalization is a commendable goal in the modern era, some argue that it is not yet the primary solution to India's current economic woes. In a nation where a significant portion of the population still lacks access to basic necessities such as clean water and electricity, it is questionable whether prioritizing technological innovations is the most prudent approach to addressing major economic issues. Finally, many consider the penchant for infrastructural projects as an attempt by the Indian government to create short-term solutions to long-term problems. By presenting these projects as a means for economic stimulation, the government may be ignoring more pressing challenges- such as the need for sustainable agricultural development, reducing income inequality, and providing reliable access to essential services. In conclusion, while the objectives laid out in India's latest economic plan may appear optimistic, the lack of specific implementation strategies and a failure to address deep-rooted structural issues within the country's economy have left analysts unconvinced. To achieve lasting growth and stability, India must shift its focus from presenting glimmering policy promises to presenting actionable, targeted solutions that accurately address the nation's multitude of economic and social issues. Until then, the optimism surrounding India's economic ascent will remain tempered by the doubts of the expert community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Process: - Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity - Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electric current gets introduced from power source - Flows through the wire - Magnetic field gets created in the wire - And the metal gets magnetized - When turned off it is no longer magnetic. Question: suppose some copper broke happens, how will it affect results in a stronger electromagnet. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If a break occurs in the copper wire used to create an electromagnet, it will negatively impact the strength of the electromagnet. Conductive copper wire is crucial for generating a strong magnetic field when an electric current is introduced through it. This magnetic field is what magnetizes the piece of metal, giving it its electromagnetic properties. Each coil of wire that wraps around the metal enhances the strength of the magnetic field, so a continuous and uninterrupted wire is essential for an effective electromagnet. When a break happens in a copper wire, the electric current would not flow through it as efficiently or may not flow through it at all, which will disrupt and weaken the magnetic field. Consequently, this will lead to a less effective electromagnet with reduced magnetization properties. Comparing the scenarios with and without the break, there will be a reduction in the magnet's ability to attract or repel other ferromagnetic materials. As for the supposed perturbation's influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the metal's magnetization, it will also have a negative impact. If the break in the copper wire reduces the electromagnet's strength, the metal will be less magnetized than it would have been without the break. This weaker effect means that the metal will have a reduced ability to attract or repel other ferromagnetic materials when the electric current is applied. In summary, a break in the copper wire used in creating an electromagnet will have a detrimental effect on the resulting magnetic field and the metal's magnetization ability.

In this task, I was asked to complete a piece of text. This required careful examination of the given text to understand its context, tone, and to maintain continuity in the story. The given text appears to be part of a dialogue or narrative, perhaps from a book or a story. The main character, Conor, is interacting with a creature referred to as 'the monster'. Conor's reaction implies that he is unimpressed or unafraid of the monster's manifestations, in this case, the berries. I continued the sentence by using the word 'berries' as it fits the context. It seems that Conor was being sarcastic or dismissive towards the monster's actions. It is inline with Conor's previous dialogues which were filled with dismissive and defiant attitude. Hence, my choice to end the sentence with the word 'berries' is to maintain flow and consistency with the rest of the paragraph.

Given the question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

By. Daniel Bates. Preacher of hate Abu Hamza yesterday told a court yesterday he had just been a spokesman for Yemeni a terrorist group that ended up killing three Britons ‘like Gerry Adams with the IRA’. Hamza said he had no advanced knowledge of the kidnapping of 16 tourists in December 1998 - which ended in a bloodbath when three Britons and an Australian were killed in a firefight. Hamza admitted the prosecution claim that he bought the kidnappers a satellite phone and topped it up with £500 credit. Hiding in plain sight: Abu Hamza, sketched giving testimony earlier this month, was accused by the judge of hiding his terror message behind his religion. But he claimed his motives were dramatically different from those which have been alleged - because he wanted a peaceful conclusion. Hamza, who at the time was running the Finsbury Park mosque in North London said: ‘To be clear, I was acting like Gerry Adams with the IRA. ‘We couldn’t afford to do anything other than (be) legal and transparent’. The court was shown phone records from December 27 1998, the day before the kidnapping, which revealed that Hamza’s home landline was called three times by the satellite phone. The following day the tourists were ambushed as they drove through the desert in Yemen by members of the fanatical Islamic Army of Aden. Abu Hamza al-Masri facing U.S. terrorism charges, gives testimony in Manhattan federal court in New York in this artist's sketch. Hamza said that he only found out after the fact because he was called by an associate in the UK - and felt that a ‘can of worms’ had been opened. He told the jury how he thought the terrorists had shown ‘ignorance’ by moving without consulting him. Five hours after the hostage taking - as the tourists were being used as human shields amid a furious gun battle - Hamza spoke to the ringleader Abu Hasan on the satellite phone. Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri in the street outside the closed Finsbury Park Mosque in London. He said: ‘I didn’t argue with him. I said to him I was a bit angry. He said don’t panic, these things happen in Yemen every day. I said this is different’. Hasan told him he wanted to be a martyr but Hamza told him that ‘this is not the platform’ to do so. Hamza issued a press release and gave a press conference at Conway Hall in London to try and put pressure on the Yemeni government not to attempt a rescue. But his efforts were unsuccessful and carnage ensued when the Yemeni army advanced. The terrorists who he had been talking to forced all 16 captives to stand on mounds and fired through their legs during the terrifying ordeal, the court has been told. Hamza, 56, who only has one eye and has stumps for hands, is also accused of trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon and trying to facilitate jihad in Afghanistan. He denies all the charges and the trial at Manhattan’s Federal Court, which is in its fifth week, continues.

If Various statements of the ECP rule can now be reviewed., can we conclude that \\"There is still no way to review the statements.\\"?","completion":"It is important to understand the context in which the ECP (Extended Consistent Parenthesization) rule is being discussed to assess if the statements can be reviewed or not. Assuming that ECP rules can now be reviewed as stated in the question, we cannot conclude that \\"There is still no way to review the statements.\\" Let's analyze this further. The ECP rule is a concept in context-free grammars (CFGs) and the parsing of programming languages. It is an extension of Consistent Parenthesization, which refers to a consistent way of adding parentheses around expressions following specific precedence rules. The ECP rule helps ensure the syntax of a program is well-formed and parsed correctly without ambiguity. Given that various statements of the ECP rule can now be reviewed, it implies that these rules have been established or updated in some manner, making it possible to analyze them. Here are some reasons that might have led to this conclusion: 1. New or Updated Guidelines: Developments and new insights might have come up with better definitions or standards for the ECP rule, enabling people to review them more effectively. 2. Improved Tools and Technologies: There might have been advancements in tools and technologies that can parse and process code, making it easier to review the ECP rule statements. These tools could include compilers, interpreters, parsers, or other software designed to analyze and interpret programming languages. 3. Research and Collaboration: Research could have led to the development of new methods to analyze and discuss the ECP rule among programming language experts and researchers, enabling the review of these statements. 4. Availability of Resources: Finally, there is a possibility that resources like articles, reference manuals, or books detailing the ECP rule may have become available or updated, thus facilitating the review process. In conclusion, given that the question states that various statements of the ECP rule can now be reviewed, the assumption would be that there are ways to review the statements. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \\"There is still no way to review the statements.\\" On the contrary, it suggests that the statements have become more accessible, possibly due to advancements in research, technology, resources, or guidelines, enabling individuals to review and analyze the ECP rule more effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","completion":"These tasks include the necessary steps to be taken in order to orient the country toward joining NATO. The statement in the original language refers to a series of tasks and responsibilities that need to be carried out to guide a nation towards membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO is an intergovernmental military alliance between North American and European countries established in 1949. The primary purpose of NATO is to provide collective defense and ensure the security of its member states through political and military collaboration. For a country looking to join NATO, there are several requirements and conditions that need to be fulfilled before they can become a member. These include: 1. Commitment to democracy: A prospective member should demonstrate that it has a stable democratic political system, with respect for individual freedoms and the rule of law. 2. Civilian control of the military: There should be transparent and effective civilian control of the military institutions, ensuring that the armed forces operate under the principles and values of democracy. 3. Economic stability: Prospective members should possess a functioning market economy capable of addressing and adapting to the challenges of NATO membership. 4. Security and defense capabilities: A potential member should have a well-functioning security and defense system, capable of fulfilling the principle of collective defense and contributing to the security of the alliance. 5. Compliance with NATO standards: Prospective members should adopt NATO norms, procedures, and standards related to interoperability, communications, training, and logistics within their military structures. This ensures that countries can work effectively together in peacetime as well as in crisis situations. 6. Conflict resolution: Countries with unresolved territorial or ethnic disputes are expected to resolve these issues through peaceful means to promote regional stability and security. 7. Contributions to NATO missions: Aspiring members should demonstrate their commitment to NATO's values by actively contributing to the organization's missions, operations, and activities. Once these requirements are met, a country can initiate an official application for NATO membership through diplomatic channels. The application process involves a series of negotiations and intense dialogue between the aspiring member and the alliance. The decision for membership is reached by consensus among all current NATO member states. In summary, a country aiming to join NATO must undertake a series of specific tasks and responsibilities, such as demonstrating commitment to democratic principles, resolving conflicts peacefully, investing in defense capabilities, and adopting NATO standards. By successfully engaging in these tasks, a nation can eventually become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, benefitting from the security guarantees and strategic partnerships inherent in the alliance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are the only remaining Hindu community native to the Kashmir Valley. - Kashmir is the northernmost geographical region of the Indian subcontinent. Until the mid-19th century, the term \\"Kashmir\\" denoted only the valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal mountain range. Today, it denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir (subdivided into Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh divisions), the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract. - Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit (18 August 1900 1 December 1990) was an Indian diplomat and politician, the sister of Jawaharlal Nehru, the aunt of Indira Gandhi and the grand-aunt of Rajiv Gandhi, each of whom served as Prime Minister of India. Pandit was sent to London, as India's most important diplomat, after serving as Nehrus envoy to the Soviet Union, the USA and the United Nations. Her time in London offers insights into the wider context of changes in IndoBritish relations. Her High-Commissionership was a microcosm of inter-governmental relations. - Rajiv Ratna Gandhi (20 August 1944 21 May 1991) was the Prime Minister of India, serving from 1984 to 1989. He took office after the 1984 assassination of his mother, Prime Minister Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi, to become the youngest Indian Prime Minister at the age of 40. - The Prime Minister of India (Hindi: , \\"Bhrat k Pradhnamantr\\") is the Head of Government and leader of the executive branch of the Government of India. The Prime Minister is also the chief adviser to the President of India and head of the Council of Ministers. He or she can be a member of any of the two houses of Parliament (the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha), but has to be the leader of the political party, having a majority in the Lok Sabha. - Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 30 January 1948) was the preeminent leader of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahatma (Sanskrit: \\"high-souled\\", \\"venerable\\")applied to him first in 1914 in South Africais now used worldwide. In India, he is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for \\"father\\", \\"papa\\") and Gandhiji. He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation. - Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi (Nehru; 19 November 1917 31 October 1984) was an Indian politician and central figure of the Indian National Congress party, and to date the only female Prime Minister of India. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. She served as Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984, making her the second-longest-serving Prime Minister of India after her father. Gandhi served as her father's personal assistant and hostess during his tenure as prime minister between 1947 and 1964. She was elected Congress President in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964, Gandhi refused to enter the Congress party leadership contest and instead chose to become a cabinet minister in the government led by Lal Bahadur Shastri. In the Congress Party's parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966, upon the death of Shastri, she defeated her rival, Morarji Desai, to become leader, and thus succeeded Shastri as Prime Minister of India. - Jawaharlal Nehru (14 November 1889 27 May 1964) was the first Prime Minister of India and a central figure in Indian politics before and after independence. He emerged as the paramount leader of the Indian independence movement under the tutelage of Mahatma Gandhi and ruled India from its establishment as an independent nation in 1947 until his death in 1964. He is considered to be the architect of the modern Indian nation-state: a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. He was also known as Pandit Nehru due to his roots with the Kashmiri Pandit community while many Indian children knew him as \\"Uncle Nehru\\" (\\"Chacha\\" Nehru). - The Indian independence movement encompassed activities and ideas aiming to end the East India Company rule (17571858) and the British Indian Empire (18581947) in the Indian subcontinent.

If you're in a war what are you likely to have to do to another person? - make friend - fight enemy - conquer opponent - change society - kill The best answer is A:","completion":"In a war, individuals may face a variety of situations, each demanding different actions and responses. While each scenario has its significance, it is crucial to analyze the most prevalent aspects and consequences of being engaged in warfare. A: Fight enemy The act of fighting an enemy is an inherent aspect of warfare. Soldiers are usually trained to defend their homeland, protect their fellow citizens, and preserve the core values of their nation. Fighting the enemy can take many forms, such as engaging in direct combat, executing strategic missions, gathering intelligence, or offering support to allies. In essence, the primary objective is to weaken the opposition and gain an advantage, ultimately leading to victory. B: Conquer opponent Another key aspect of warfare is conquering the opponent. This involves not only defeating enemy forces on the battlefield but also occupying their territory, dismantling their political infrastructure, and ensuring the submission of the opposing nation. Conquering an opponent may also involve psychological warfare, in which misinformation and propaganda are employed to break the enemy's morale and unity. The end goal is to establish one's dominance and exert control over the defeated faction, either by installing a new government or directly ruling as an occupying power. C: Kill Warfare inevitably involves the taking of human lives. Soldiers are often required to kill enemy combatants to protect themselves, their comrades, and their nations' interests. While the notion of killing another person is morally complex and deeply unsettling, soldiers may also view it as a necessary step to achieve victory and restore peace. Moreover, in modern warfare, many deaths result from the use of advanced technology and weaponry, such as bombings, drone strikes, and missiles. Consequently, it is vital to recognize that killing is an inherent byproduct of war, regardless of whether it is committed intentionally or as collateral damage. D: Change society Wars can have far-reaching and long-lasting effects on society. The impact of warfare varies greatly depending on the nature, scope, and duration of the conflict, but some common consequences include economic disruption, physical devastation, population displacement, and social upheaval. As a participant in war, one might have to contribute to altering their society, either actively or passively. The process of societal change may involve the restructuring of political systems, reshaping cultural norms, or rebuilding infrastructure following the conflict's end. E: Make friends Although war is intrinsically characterized by conflict and struggle, it may also present opportunities for forging new relationships and alliances. Soldiers often develop a strong sense of camaraderie and loyalty to their comrades in arms, partly due to the shared experiences of training, combat, and adversity. Additionally, nations fighting common enemies may choose to establish partnerships or alliances, pooling their resources and working cooperatively to achieve a shared objective. Consequently, cultivating friendships in war—whether at the individual or national level—can prove advantageous by bolstering one's strength, resilience, and strategic capabilities. In conclusion, the best answer to the question \\"If you're in a war what are you likely to have to do to another person?\\" is multifaceted and cannot be limited to a single response. While all of the aforementioned aspects—fighting the enemy, conquering the opponent, killing, changing society, and making friends—are integral to the nature and consequences of warfare, their significance varies according to context and individual experiences. Understanding the complexities and moral implications of war requires examining each aspect and appreciating the multifarious and often contradictory roles and responsibilities one must confront."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Mohammed Ali gifted it in an attempt to further his own interests. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise given states that a monument or structure was erected in 1836 as a gift from Mohammed Ali, the viceroy of Egypt. The hypothesis posits that Mohammed Ali gifted it in an attempt to further his own interests. However, the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, as it only provides information about the origin of the gift and the person responsible for it. To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we would need to look deeper into the context and motivations behind Mohammed Ali's actions. From the premise alone, it is unclear why he chose to make this particular gift, and whether it was motivated by personal interests or more altruistic reasons. It is possible that Mohammed Ali's intentions were to promote goodwill between nations, celebrate a particular event, or foster cultural exchange – or, as the hypothesis suggests, to advance his own interests. If further historical context were provided, we may be able to evaluate whether the premise entails the hypothesis. For instance, if it is known that around this time Mohammed Ali was seeking political alliances, or was in negotiations that could benefit from offering such a gift, then the hypothesis may be more likely to be entailed by the premise. However, without additional context and supporting evidence, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In summary, the premise about the gift from Mohammed Ali, the viceroy of Egypt, does not entail the hypothesis that it was given to further his own interests. More context and historical evidence are needed to evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here are possible answers to this question: - closet - musical instrument store - instrument case - music shop - music store I believe the correct choice is \\"instrument case\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Storing a mandolin in an instrument case is indeed the correct and most appropriate choice for a number of reasons. Let us discuss these reasons in detail to understand why this answer is superior to the other options provided. 1. Protection: Instrument cases are designed specifically to protect musical instruments from various elements like dust, moisture, and impacts. They are usually well-padded and provide a snug fit to hold the instrument securely. Storing your mandolin in an instrument case will help in keeping it safe from accidental damages and ensure that it remains in perfect condition for a long time. 2. Portability: Instrument cases are often equipped with handles or shoulder straps, making it easy to transport your mandolin comfortably and safely. When you store your mandolin in an instrument case, you can easily carry it around to practice sessions, gigs, or music classes without any hassle. 3. Controlled Environment: When stored in an instrument case, your mandolin is away from direct sunlight, temperature fluctuations, and other environmental factors that may affect the instrument's condition. This helps in maintaining its tuning stability and overall playability. 4. Organization: Most instrument cases also have extra compartments or pockets to store essential accessories like picks, strings, tuners, etc. This keeps everything related to your mandolin organized and easily accessible whenever required. Now, let's discuss the other options briefly: - Closet: Storing your mandolin in a closet might seem convenient, but it also makes it vulnerable to damage or deformation due to overcrowding or improper storage. Moreover, closets may not provide adequate protection from environmental factors, leading to tuning instability. - Musical instrument store, music shop, or music store: These options imply that you would be temporarily or permanently giving away your mandolin to a third-party location. It is not feasible to store your instrument at a store, shop, or any other external place, as it would be inconvenient, costly, and could expose your instrument to potential theft or damage. In conclusion, storing your mandolin in an instrument case is the most suitable option as it ensures protection, portability, a controlled environment, and organization for your mandolin while keeping it within your possession. The other available options cannot provide a balance of safety, convenience, and accessibility in the same way an instrument case can."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This is going to be a long day.","completion":"In order to describe the sentiment of the tweet \\"Feel's ill. Shiiiit. This is going to be a long day.\\", we must first identify the key emotions and expressions that were used in the statement. Then, we can provide a comprehensive analysis of the overall mood, tone, and sentiment that the user is trying to convey. 1. Feel's ill: The user is expressing that they are not feeling well, most likely physically. This statement implies discomfort, uneasiness, or pain, which are associated with feelings of negativity. Since being unwell is not a pleasant experience, this further indicates that the sentiment being expressed here is negative. 2. Shiiiit: This interjection (a slightly vulgar, informal curse) is used to emphasize strong reactions to a situation, whether negative or positive. In this case, the sentiment is negative because the user is upset or distressed about feeling unwell. Furthermore, it can be assumed that the tweet's sentiment is intensified due to the punctuation and extra letters, reflecting the user's strong displeasure. 3. This is going to be a long day: The user predicts that their day is going to be long, which implies that they are expecting it to be challenging, tiring, or difficult to get through. When a person is physically unwell, enduring daily tasks might seem more draining or tedious than usual. Therefore, this statement suggests that the user dreads the prospect of a long day due to their current circumstance. Taking into consideration all the aforementioned phrases and emotions, the sentiment of the tweet \\"Feel's ill. Shiiiit. This is going to be a long day.\\" can be described as predominantly negative. The user is expressing their unhappiness by sharing feelings of discomfort and ill health, while also emphasizing their frustration and dread about the anticipated long day that lies ahead.

In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons., can you guess it ?

Use evidence from the fact that chemical splashing can cause harm to the eyes to answer this question: \\"Make sure to protect your eyes when working with chemicals because they can easily do what if handled wrong\\"","completion":"Make sure to protect your eyes when working with chemicals because they can easily cause harm, including irritation, chemical burns, or even blindness if handled incorrectly. Working with chemicals, especially those that are corrosive, acidic, alkaline, or have reactive properties, poses several potential dangers to the human eyes. When manipulated without proper safety measures, a chemical splash or accidental contact may occur, leading to the following negative consequences: 1. Eye irritation: Various chemicals, such as solvents or detergents, can cause mild to moderate irritation of the eye. This is characterized by redness, tearing, itching, and a burning sensation. In most cases, eye irritation can be treated effectively with flushing and over-the-counter eye drops, but persistent symptoms may require medical attention. 2. Chemical burns: Corrosive substances, such as strong acids (e.g., sulfuric or hydrochloric acid), strong bases (e.g., sodium or potassium hydroxide), and some oxidizing agents (e.g., hydrogen peroxide or bleach) can cause chemical burns upon contact with the eyes. These burns can range from superficial to deep, potentially causing irreversible damage to the cornea, sclera, conjunctiva, and other ocular tissues. Chemical burns are considered a medical emergency and require immediate treatment, including extensive flushing and professional care. 3. Phototoxicity: Some chemicals, particularly photosensitizers like certain drugs or industrial compounds, can cause phototoxic reactions upon exposure to light. When absorbed by the eye, these chemicals heighten the sensitivity of ocular tissues to light, resulting in inflammation, redness, and discomfort. Proper safety measures, such as avoiding sunlight or wearing appropriate sunglasses, should be taken when dealing with photosensitizing agents. 4. Allergic reactions: Some individuals may develop allergic reactions to specific chemicals, leading to localized ocular symptoms like itching, swelling, and redness. In such cases, an individual should avoid further contact with the allergen and seek medical assistance as needed. 5. Permanent blindness: In extreme cases, exposure to certain chemicals, particularly those with corrosive properties, can lead to permanent blindness. Such damage may result from severe chemical burns or direct harm to ocular structures, such as the retina and optic nerves. To prevent these detrimental consequences, proper eye protection should be worn when working with chemicals. Safety goggles or full-face shields made from durable, impact-resistant materials are designed to safeguard the eyes from chemical splashes and contact. Additionally, following standard laboratory procedures, handling chemicals with care, maintaining adequate ventilation, and knowing the properties of the substances in use, are all important aspects of eye safety when working with chemicals. In conclusion, it is crucial to protect your eyes when working with chemicals, as different substances can easily cause a range of harmful effects, including irritation, burns, or even permanent vision loss when handled improperly. By wearing the appropriate protective equipment and following established safety practices, the risk of chemical-related eye injuries can be significantly minimized."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Q: What do all sound waves begin with?

Archaeologists are set to excavate the buried remains of a sixth century chapel - which could be Britain's oldest place of Christian worship. St Piran's Oratory near Perranporth, Cornwall, has been encased in a concrete bunker for decades to protect it from the elements. But experts have finally been granted permission to remove the casing so they can begin excavating and preserving the medieval site. St Piran's Oratory is pictured in its protective shell in 1955. James Gossip, an archaeologist at Cornwall Council, said: 'This is a very important site and it will be amazing to see what is under the sand' Saint Piran was an early 6th-century Cornish abbot and saint from Ireland. He is the patron saint of tin-miners and the patron saint of Cornwall. Legend has it that the heathen Irish tied him to a mill-stone, rolled it over the edge of a cliff into a tempestuous sea, which suddenly became calm. He then floated safely over the sea to land upon the sandy beach of Perranzabuloe in Cornwall. He was joined at Perranzabuloe by many of his Christian converts and together they founded the Abbey of Lanpiran, with Piran as abbot. Saint Piran 'rediscovered' tin-smelting - tin had been smelted in Cornwall since before the Romans' arrival, but the methods had since been forgotten - when his black hearthstone, a slab of tin-bearing ore, had the tin smelt out of it and rise to the top in the form of a white cross. This white cross then came to be the symbol of Cornwall. According to legend, St Piran, the patron saint of tinners, built the chapel and forged a white cross in a fire which went on to become the symbol of Cornwall. Engulfed by sand in the Middle Ages, the remains of the oratory were first discovered in the late 18th Century. There were two major digs in 1835 and 1843 that uncovered a number of skeletons - including one of large, headless man. However, the remains were buried and encased in a large bunker in 1910 to protect them.

A more appropriate answer for this question would be: A sump pump is used for removing accumulated water from a sump basin or pit, typically located in the basement or crawlspace of a house or building. The primary purpose of a sump pump is to prevent flooding and water damage by rerouting excess water away from the foundation of the structure. This helps maintain structural integrity and reduce dampness or mold growth in the lower levels of the building. Sump pumps can be either submersible or pedestal types, and they are activated by a float switch when the water level in the sump basin reaches a certain point. Once activated, the sump pump removes the water by pumping it through a discharge pipe to a safe distance away from the property."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the urban hubs that are within 6 miles of the ridge that picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge? ? The Metacomet Ridge picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge, beginning on Sugarloaf Mountain and the parallel massif of Mount Toby, 1,269 feet (387 m), the high point of the Metacomet Ridge geography. Both Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby are composed of erosion-resistant sedimentary rock. North of Mount Sugarloaf, the Pocumtuck Ridge continues as alternating sedimentary and traprock dominated strata to Greenfield, Massachusetts. From Greenfield north to 2 miles (3 km) short of the Vermont–New Hampshire–Massachusetts tri-border, the profile of the Metacomet Ridge diminishes into a series of nondescript hills and low, wooded mountain peaks composed of sedimentary rock with dwindling traprock outcrops.In Connecticut, the high point of the Metacomet Ridge is West Peak of the Hanging Hills at 1,024 feet (312 m); in Massachusetts, the highest traprock peak is Mount Tom, 1,202 feet (366 m), although Mount Toby, made of sedimentary rock, is higher. Visually, the Metacomet Ridge is narrowest at Provin Mountain and East Mountain in Massachusetts where it is less than 0.5 miles (1 km) wide; it is widest at Totoket Mountain, over 4 miles (6 km). However, low parallel hills and related strata along much of the range often make the actual geologic breadth of the Metacomet Ridge wider than the more noticeable ridgeline crests, up to 10 miles (16 km) across in some areas. Significant river drainages of the Metacomet Ridge include the Connecticut River and tributaries (Falls River, Deerfield River, Westfield River, Farmington River, Coginchaug River); and, in southern Connecticut, the Quinnipiac River.The Metacomet Ridge is surrounded by rural wooded, agricultural, and suburban landscapes, and is no more than 6 miles (10 km) from a number of urban hubs such as New Haven, Meriden, New Britain, Hartford, and Springfield. Small city centers abutting the ridge include Greenfield, Northampton, Amherst, Holyoke, West Hartford, Farmington, Wallingford, and Hamden. Answer:","completion":"The urban hubs that are within 6 miles of the ridge that picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge include New Haven, Meriden, New Britain, Hartford, and Springfield. Additionally, small city centers that are in close proximity to the ridge are Greenfield, Northampton, Amherst, Holyoke, West Hartford, Farmington, Wallingford, and Hamden. These urban hubs and city centers are surrounded by rural wooded, agricultural, and suburban landscapes, demonstrating the diverse environment created by the Metacomet Ridge and its proximity to various urban areas in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Affordability is often a vital component influencing customer satisfaction, and by including this detail in the review, the reviewer is conveying that they've received great value for their money. This, in turn, encourages potential customers to consider the offering, given that it has already been endorsed for its affordability. In summary, the sentiment of this review can be described as highly positive, as it effectively demonstrates broad satisfaction with every aspect experienced and emphasizes the value derived from reasonable prices.

During the second press conference, held on June 25th, the speaker reiterated the messages that were previously mentioned. This event was not only a live gathering, but it also ensured that a wider audience could be reached by being broadcasted on the Web. Through this method, the speaker aimed to emphasize the key points and ideas that were discussed earlier, allowing more people to be informed and engaged in the conversation. The use of live streaming and web broadcasts for such events has become increasingly common in today's digital age. It provides a convenient way for individuals who cannot attend the conference in person to still have access to the information and discussions taking place. This can be particularly useful for those who may be in different time zones, have mobility issues, or are simply unable to attend due to other commitments. Moreover, the internet has removed geographical barriers that once limited the sharing of knowledge and ideas. With this in mind, it is essential for conferences and events to embrace technology and utilize various tools, such as live streaming, to maximize the reach of their messages. By doing so, they can ensure that a larger and more diverse audience is engaged and informed about the various topics and issues being addressed. In the case of the press conference that took place on June 25th, the speaker chose to reinforce their messages by providing the public with another opportunity to hear them. By doing this, they hoped to enhance the understanding and impact of their ideas, demonstrating their commitment to transparency and open communication. This approach also enabled the speaker to address potential questions, clarify misunderstandings, and engage in constructive debates with those who were watching or participating in the digital conversation. As a result, the press conference provided valuable insights to the viewers and fostered a conducive environment for learning, exchange, and collaboration. In conclusion, the use of technology, particularly live streaming, greatly contributed to the effectiveness of the second press conference on June 25th. The speaker's decision to reiterate their messages allowed for the key points to be further reinforced, whilst also enabling a wider and more diverse audience to be reached due to the accessibility of the web broadcast.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Select from: - no. - yes.","completion":"The answer is \\"no\\". The two questions are not the same; they aim to inquire about different aspects related to the same topic - a road named Aurangzeb in Delhi. The first question, \\"Why is there a road named Aurangzeb in Delhi?\\" is seeking an historical explanation or context to the naming. It assumes that there could be substantial historical or cultural reasons for having a road in Delhi named after Aurangzeb. To answer this, one would have to delve into history and possibly comprehend the legacy of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, as well as the history and city planning practices of Delhi. Aurangzeb was the sixth Mughal Emperor, ruling over most of the Indian subcontinent for nearly 50 years from 1658 until his death in 1707. His reign, controversial as it may be, undeniably constitutes an important part of Indian history. Delhi, being the capital city of India, hosts various sites and structures named after figures in Indian history, Mughal or otherwise. This includes Aurangzeb Road, which was named to mark his influence and rule. The second question, however, \\"How do you justify naming a road after Aurangzeb?\\" implicates normative judgments and ethical or political considerations based upon the historical figure of Aurangzeb. The question infers that the act of having a road named after Aurangzeb might be controversial or objectionable, thereby necessitating justification. In this context, Aurangzeb is often remembered for his religious orthodoxy and uncompromising militarism, with critics arguing that his rule was marked by tyranny, forced religious conversions, and destruction of Hindu temples. Those who oppose the naming of the road after Aurangzeb cite these aspects of his rule. In response, some argue that naming a road does not necessarily equate to glorifying a figure, but recognizing them as an undeniable part of history, while others propose renaming based upon contemporary values and ethics. In conclusion, while both questions relate to the Aurangzeb Road in Delhi, they seek different facets of understanding - one being historical and factual, the other ethical and interpretive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby. Initially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake. When Carrie disobeys her father's rules regarding visits to the nearest town, Hank decides to punish Carrie by temporarily relocating Flicka to the farm of one of his ranch hands, Toby. After a midnight visit by Carrie, Flicka tries to follow Carrie home to Hank's ranch, but accidentally ends up on the ranch belonging to Amy's father HD Walker. Upon entering the Walker ranch, Flicka damages a fence and releases some of HD's prize cows. At Amy's request, HD asks for Flicka as payment for the damage, threatening to turn it into a lawsuit if Hank refuses. Amy then starts training with Flicka for a championship, but performs poorly during the actual competition because of Flicka's fear of the crowd and camera flashes from the audience.

Do these two sentences convey the same information? Choices: (A). no. (B). yes.","completion":"(B). yes. Both sentences convey the same information despite the slight difference in their structure. They tell us about three key events: the seizure of Valerin's castle, the killing of Valerin himself, and the release of the queen. The only structural difference between the two sentences is the use of the passive voice in the second sentence, which emphasizes that the queen is the one being released. In Sentence 1, \\"the queen released\\" uses the active voice, implying that the queen is responsible for releasing herself from captivity. However, the context of the sentence suggests that Valerin's death has caused her to be freed, so her agency in the action is not as important as the event itself. In Sentence 2, \\"the queen is released\\" employs the passive voice and places more emphasis on the action of the queen being released, rather than specifying who or what is causing her release.

The Obama administration's top environmental official in the oil-rich South and Southwest region has resigned after Republicans targeted him over remarks made two years ago when he used the word \\"crucify\\" to describe his approach to enforcement. In a letter to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson sent Sunday, Al Armendariz says he regrets his words and stresses that they do not reflect his work as administrator of the five-state region including Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. Republicans in Congress had called for Armendariz' firing, after Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe highlighted the May 2010 speech last week as proof of what he refers to as EPA's assault on energy, particularly the technique of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Several disputed contamination cases in Texas have helped stoke environmental concerns over fracking. ||||| A top administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has apologized for using the word \\"crucify\\" two years ago when describing the agency's enforcement policies, and for saying it makes examples of bad players in the oil and gas industry. EPA Region 6 administrator Al Armendariz, who oversees Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and New Mexico, issued a written apology Wednesday after video surfaced of him at a meeting in May 2010 in the tiny town of Dish. The video shows Armendariz answering a question about the agency's enforcement policies. In the Middle Ages, he tells the crowd, the Romans would enter a troublesome village, \\"take the first five guys they saw and crucify them.\\" Then the town would be \\"really easy to manage for the next few years,\\" he said. The EPA also makes \\"examples of people who are not complying with the law, you make examples out of them, use it as a deterrent method,\\" Armendariz continued. \\"Companies that are smart see that and they don't want to play that, and they decide at that point that it's time to clean up.\\" To some Republicans and conservatives, the comments justified their long-standing allegation that the EPA under President Barack Obama has stepped up enforcement to a point where it is harming the economy and the energy industry. The EPA also has become a popular target on the campaign trail, and Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney has in the past called for EPA chief Lisa P. Jackson to be fired. Armendariz's apology was issued Wednesday by the EPA's headquarters in Washington. \\"I apologize to those I have offended and regret my poor choice of words. It was an offensive and inaccurate way to portray our efforts to address potential violations of our nation's environmental laws,\\" he said. \\"I am always and have been committed to fair and vigorous enforcement of those laws.\\" Cynthia Giles, the assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance assurance, also issued a statement. \\"Strong, fair and effective enforcement of the environmental laws passed by Congress is critical to protecting public health and ensuring that all companies, regardless of industry, are playing by the same rules,\\" she wrote. Dish is a town north of Dallas where residents' concerns over the environmental impacts of a new method of gas drilling helped put the issue on the national stage. Testing showed some groundwater contamination and elevated toxic air pollution after operators began using a new method _ a combination of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling _ to extract once out-of-reach natural gas from impermeable layers of the Barnett shale. The EPA helped test the town's water and air, and the drillers changed some methods. Armendariz traveled to the town of 200 people to talk to residents. On Thursday, at the White House press briefing, press secretary Jay Carney was asked whether Armendariz's comments proved that the EPA's enforcement practices were unfair, such as in Pennsylvania, where testing has shown that allegations of groundwater contamination caused by fracking are false. Carney denied that. He said Armendariz's comments were \\"inaccurate as a representation of, or characterization of the way that the EPA has operated under President Obama.\\" Oil and gas production on federal lands and waters have increased since Obama took office, he said. Later Thursday, Republican Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott issued a statement saying the administration was \\"more worried about aggressively advancing its radical agenda (than) fostering job growth and expanding our economy.\\" __ Associated Press writers Dina Cappiello and Anne Gearan contributed to this report from Washington. __ Plushnick-Masti can be followed on Twitter at https://twitter.com//RamitMastiAP ||||| (Dr. Alfredo \\" Al\\" Armendariz in a 2009 portrait. -- G.J.

Armendariz was already a lightning rod for conservative critics of the EPA in Texas before last week, when a video became public in which Armendariz spoke of \\"crucifying\\" oil and gas companies that broke the law.

Background: Mohanlal Viswanathan was born in the village of Elanthoor in the Pathanamthitta district on 21 May 1960. He is the youngest child of Viswanathan Nair, a former bureaucrat and law secretary with the Kerala Government, and Santhakumari. He grew up at Mudavanmugal, Poojappura, at his paternal house in Thiruvananthapuram. Mohanlal studied at Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Thiruvananthapuram and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Mahatma Gandhi College in Thiruvananthapuram. Context: Mohanlal had acted in several amateur plays before entering into films. In 2001, he debuted in professional drama playing Karna (a character from the Indian epic Mahabharata) in Karnabharam, a Sanskrit-language play directed by Kavalam Narayana Panicker. It premiered at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi on 29 March 2001 as part of the National Theatre Festival of the National School of Drama. The play depicts Karna's mental agony a day before the Kurukshetra War, as he thinks about his past and his faith. Mohanlal said: \\"You cannot compare Kavalam's play with the amateur plays I did. Though there are other characters in the play, the theme revolves around Karna. It is almost like a solo performance. Some of the scenes are really touching and challenging\\". He acted without payment, saying: \\"I performed for the joy of it ... for my love of our history\\". Kadhayattam was a presentation enacted by Mohanlal, performing ten classic characters and situations from Malayalam literature, selected from ten Malayalam novels written by O. Chandu Menon, C. V. Raman Pillai, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, P. Kesavadev, Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, Uroob, O. V. Vijayan, M. Mukundan, and M. T. Vasudevan Nair over a 100-year period. The play, directed by T. K. Rajeev Kumar premiered at the Senate Hall of University of Kerala on 1 November 2003, and later was staged in Kozhikode, Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi. In 2008, Mohanlal along with Mukesh performed in Chayamukhi, written and directed by Prasanth Narayanan. Mohanlal and Mukesh portrayed Bheeman and Keechakan respectively, the characters from Mahabharata. It had a play within a play narrative style. It premiered at the Lulu International Convention Centre in Thrissur on 12 March 2008, and later was staged in Thiruvananthapuram, Bangalore, Kollam, Kochi, and Kozhikode. A critic from The Hindu wrote: \\"Chayamukhi is, arguably, the finest work on Malayalam stage in recent times\\". In the same year, Mohanlal voiced Hanuman in the English ballet Maya Ravan, directed by Shobana. In 2014, Mohanlal and musician Ratheesh Vegha formed the music band Lalisom - The Lal Effect. Its maiden show was at the 2015 National Games of India. The band drew flak from social media initially for charging an amount of Rs1.63 crore and later for lip-syncing. Following the criticism, Mohanlal returned the amount to the government, which they refused stating that the government's morality would not allow to take back the money and Mohanlal had not personally benefited from the amount which he received, since it was meant to meet the stage expenses and remuneration for the artistes. Despite that, Mohanlal did not take back the money he dispatched. In 2015, he collaborated once again with Mukesh for Naga, but this time as the narrator. The play, based on Girish Karnad's Kannada play Nagamandala, was directed by Suveeran. Naga was a combination of myth, superstition, fact, and fantasy. It was premiered at the Parish Hall of St. George Church, Kalady on 9 August 2015. Question: did he have a partner?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Mohanlal Viswanathan, the renowned Indian actor, did collaborate with various artists and creative professionals throughout his career. In the context of his theater performances, notably, he partnered with fellow actor Mukesh in two productions, Chayamukhi (2008) and Naga (2015). In Chayamukhi, they portrayed the characters Bheeman and Keechakan, while in Naga, Mohanlal served as the narrator. Although they were professional collaborators, Mohanlal did not have a consistent partner like a duo in his career, as he worked with a variety of actors, directors, and creative professionals across his extensive body of work in theater, films, and music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: The origins of the department store lay in the growth of the conspicuous consumer society at the turn of the 19th century. As the Industrial Revolution accelerated economy expansion, the affluent middle-class grew in size and wealth. This urbanized social group, sharing a culture of consumption and changing fashion, was the catalyst for the retail revolution. As rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people, especially women (who found they could shop unaccompanied at department stores without damaging their reputation), with disposable income in the late Georgian period, window shopping was transformed into a leisure activity and entrepreneurs, like the potter Josiah Wedgwood, pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence the prevailing tastes and preferences of society. What social group grew as a result of the industrial revolution?","completion":"The social group that grew as a result of the Industrial Revolution was the affluent middle-class. The Industrial Revolution led to substantial economic expansion, which in turn created more wealth and opportunities for individuals working in various sectors, such as manufacturing, trade, and services. This resulted in a significant increase in the size and purchasing power of the middle-class, making them a driving force behind the emergence of the conspicuous consumer society at the turn of the 19th century. As this newly affluent middle-class started to urbanize and share a culture of consumption and changing fashion, they became instrumental in the retail revolution that gave rise to the department store. This social group demonstrated their newfound status by adopting new consumption habits and displaying their wealth through the purchase of various goods and fashionable items. This phenomenon particularly impacted women who, during this period, found that they could shop unaccompanied at department stores without damaging their reputation. As a result, their disposable income and personal autonomy increased, transforming window shopping into a popular leisure activity. Entrepreneurs like Josiah Wedgwood recognized this emerging market and utilized innovative marketing techniques to influence the prevailing tastes and preferences of the affluent middle-class, ultimately shaping the way the retail industry operated during that time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A 103-year-old believed to be Britain’s oldest punter is hoping for a winner on this year’s Grand National - after betting on the race for more than seven decades without success. George Atkinson said he is hoping to finally have a successful bet on the world-famous race, so he can 'die a happy man'. Mr Atkinson has placed bets religiously on the Grand National each year since the 1940s. George Atkinson, a 103-year-old who is believed to be Britain's oldest punter, is hoping for a winner on this year's Grand National - after betting on the race for more than seven decades without success. That's a lot of birthdays! George says he would 'die a happy man' if he finally wins this year. But he has never managed to back a winner, and fears the 2014 race is his last chance. And after such a long run of betting, he has decided to pin his hopes on 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run, owned by Robert Waley-Cohen and trained by Nicky Henderson. Mr Atkinson said: 'Any winner is nice - but the national would be a dream come true - I could die a happy man.' The 103-year-old, from Swaffham, Norfolk, placed his first bet on the Grand National in the 1940s after leaving the Army. He had placed his first ever bet when he was just 12, when his bookmaker grandfather took him to the Epsom Derby. He said: 'I can’t remember the name as it lost - in fact they all lose. I’ve never even had a place.'I was once told to back Oxo in 1959 but I didn’t place a bet on it - it won and I’ve regretted it for 55 years.' George has pin his hopes on 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run. The Grand National is not the only competition Mr Atkinson has a flutter on - winning £301 from a £1 stake in 2013 by correctly predicting three of the numbers on the Irish Lottery. 'Horses are my favourite, but I love a dog race too,' he said. 'Number seven is my lucky number, but I’m not the luckiest punter.' The widowed father-of-seven, who is a grandfather and great-grandfather, goes to his local branch of bookmaker William Hill in Swaffham twice a day and even celebrated his 103rd birthday there. Believed to be Britain’s oldest punter, the company has given him a £103 bet - £51.50 each way - as he tries to fulfil his dream of a Grand National win. He has decided to put it on Long Run - whose odds of winning are currently at 14/1 - and said: 'It has been a long run without a winner and it feels like my time.' Happy punter: 'Horses are my favourite, but I love a dog race too' William Hill took more than five million bets on the Grand National last year and is expected to accept over £30 million in wagers in 2014. According to the bookmakers, around 57 per cent of Britain’s adult population is expected to place a bet on the Grand National, with 51 per cent of those who bet making their selection based on personal preferences. Based on a survey of 2,066 people conducted for the firm by Populus, 36 per cent of people will choose a horse by name; 17 per cent make their selection by odds; 9 per cent will leave it purely to chance, and make a random selection; and just 2 per cent will pick because of the colours worn by the jockey. Yvonne Dobinson, manager of William Hill Swaffham, said: 'George is living proof of how hard it is to win the Grand National with over 70 years failing to pick a winner.

Answer the following question: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nucl Jeremy is studying the periodic table in preparation for a chemistry test next week. Today he is focusing on the elements that all belong to the alkali metals group. He is especially focused on learning about lithium, which is at the top of the group, and cesium, which is at the bottom of the alkali metals group. Which element is smaller? Answer:","completion":"Lithium is the smaller element when comparing it to cesium, both of which belong to the alkali metals group in the periodic table. This size difference is due to the fact that as you go down a group, each element has an additional energy level or shell compared to the element above it. Lithium, with the atomic number of 3, only has two energy levels (1s and 2s) while Cesium, with the atomic number of 55, has 6 energy levels (1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, 6s). This increased number of energy levels or electron shells in Cesium results in a larger atomic radius because the outermost electrons are located further from the nucleus, causing the atomic size to expand. This size increase down the group is connected to the shield effect. With each new energy level, there is an added electron shield between the outermost valence electrons and the positively charged nucleus. This reduces the attractive force exerted on the outermost electrons by the nuclear charge, enabling them to stay further out which results in a larger atom. Furthermore, the distances between the nucleus and electrons in larger atoms like Cesium can also cause the differences we observe in ionization energies, as it takes less energy to remove an electron from a larger atom, like cesium, than it does to remove it from a smaller atom, like lithium. Thus, the trend in atomic size is inherently linked to the trend of ionization energy within the periodic table. So, when studying the periodic table, Jeremy will notice that atoms generally get larger as you descend a group, much like how Cesium is larger than Lithium in the alkali metal group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In certain cases compound words and set phrases may be contracted into single characters. Some of these can be considered logograms, where characters represent whole words rather than syllable-morphemes, though these are generally instead considered ligatures or abbreviations (similar to scribal abbreviations, such as & for \\"et\\"), and as non-standard. These do see use, particularly in handwriting or decoration, but also in some cases in print. In Chinese, these ligatures are called héwén (合文), héshū (合書) or hétǐzì (合体字), and in the special case of combining two characters, these are known as \\"two-syllable Chinese characters\\" (双音节汉字, 雙音節漢字). If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What are logograms?","completion":"Logograms are symbols or characters that represent a whole word or a meaningful unit of language, rather than an individual sound or syllable-morpheme. They are a type of written character found in various writing systems, including Chinese characters, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Mayan glyphs, among others. Logograms convey meaning directly through their visual representation and do not necessarily correspond to the phonetic sounds of spoken language. In a logographic writing system, each character denotes a word or a significant part of a word, which can include things like nouns, verbs, adjectives, or grammatical particles. This is in contrast to phonographic writing systems, such as the Latin script used in English, where characters typically represent individual sounds or phonemes. As a result, logographic systems tend to have a large number of distinct characters, since they need to account for the wide variety of words and concepts in a language. There are several advantages and disadvantages of using logograms. One advantage is that logographic writing can be more concise, as a single character can represent an entire word or concept. This can make writing more efficient, especially for languages with many monosyllabic words, like Chinese. Logograms can also be more readily understood by speakers of different languages or dialects, since the meaning of the character is not tied to pronunciation. On the other hand, mastering a logographic writing system can be more challenging, as it requires learning a large number of individual characters. Furthermore, representing new words or concepts can prove difficult, since they might necessitate the creation of entirely new logograms. Finally, logographic systems can be less flexible in terms of adapting to changes in language, as the visual form of a character might not easily accommodate shifts in pronunciation or meaning. Despite these challenges, logographic writing systems have been used throughout history and across various cultures. Today, they still remain an important component of modern languages like Chinese, Japanese (where they coexist with phonetic scripts, such as hiragana and katakana), and Korean (in the form of Hanja, albeit to a lesser extent compared to the Hangul script). The use and evolution of logograms continue to provide valuable insights into human language and communication, as well as the cognitive aspects of reading and writing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. Which region had more species go extinct? Hint: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the Northern region of Italy, where animals are exposed to a higher level of abiotic stress, would likely have experienced more species going extinct compared to the Southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. As abiotic stress increases, biodiversity tends to decrease, making species more susceptible to becoming threatened, endangered, and eventually extinct.

And in many ways, a very good one. My first thought after viewing, was how the hell are they going to market this thing? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies. Doesn't exactly trip off the tongue. Fido has little of Shaun's carnage, gore & belly laughs. It is a different beast altogether (forgive the pun). Fido kicks off with a black & white information film that explains the back story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh-eaters into dumb servants. At first I thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la Matinée, but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle-class nostalgia.

Until his collar goes on the blink... Fido is NOT a horror film, but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it IS. Much of the humour is of the light family variety, and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dog/family moments. Yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark, truly funny moments, which while welcome, will ensure an R rating for what is, for extended periods, a family comedy.

Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Van Halen 3 is easily the worse Van Halen album to date. Gary Cherone was a nice idea, but he is certainly not the musician / singer that Sammy Hagar is. His voice seems weak and whiny by comparison.Also, the lyrics on many of these songs are laughable. Take \\"The Ballot or the Bullet\\" for example. VH is trying to sound politically astute but only use bad cliches like \\"give me liberty or death\\" or \\"the pen is mighter than the sword.\\" The lyrics on the song \\"How Many Say I\\" are also terrible, though it is interesting to hear Eddie sing lead.The only decent song on this album is \\"Once\\", which I really like. It is melodic, with good vocals, lyrics, and guitars. The rest of the album, however, is a bomb. VH really needs to do a good album after this one to redeem themselves!

Question: What are the first names of the people who show up at the film studio to try out for roles in the company's new production? Answer the above question based on the context below: Right before closing time Karen Kirsten and Jenny Johnsen, who work as waitresses at an Oslo night club, get an offer from the National Studios assistant director Jensen. He promises to make them both famous, and wants to give them screen test auditions. They accept the offer, and the very next day the girls show up at the film studio to try out for roles in the company's new production \\"Countess of Monte Cristo\\". There are two roles available: the countess herself and her maid. However, the director, Mr. Hansen, manages to insult the young women gravely, and they leave the studios in anger, taking one of the studio's fancy cars as their ride while still wearing the costumes from the production. They drive to the luxurious Hotel Trollheimen, and use the costumes to lure the management into thinking they really are a countess and her maid. On the outside they encounter army Lt. Paul Von Cram, who is so captivated by their appearance - especially Karen's - that he offers to carry their suitcases up to their hotel suite. Because of this the two women mistake Paul for a bellboy. Paul decides to cancel his imminent date with socialite woman Peg Manning, since he now has his eyes set on Karen. He then sends Karen a note at the hotel, asking her to meet \\"a lieutenant\\" at the hotel bar. Karen is intrigued by this and has no idea that it is Paul she is meeting. She makes a makeshift dress out of the curtains in the suite and goes down to meet the lieutenant. Arriving at the bar she instantly realises her earlier mistake. Jenny discovers that they have been listed as thieves and wanted refugees from the law in a newspaper article. In a desperate attempt to hide this from the people at the hotel she buys every available newspaper she can find.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes. Question: why does Trump continue tweeting? Options: - not enough information - he has a large ego - he thinks it is helping. - he thinks he is witty Answer:","completion":"Not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

To do that, let's add 1768 to both sides of the equation: -34 * a = 1768 Now, we need to find how many apples (a) we have.

On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him, following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel. \\"He should be punished for the killings,\\" an Israeli official said, \\"He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups.\\" But the decision has angered many other countries. China said that Arafat is the true leader, elected by the Palestinian people, and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East. Other governments share this idea. Arafat himself said: \\"They can kill me, but never get me out of my country.\\" He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel. But, just like a cat with nine lives, Arafat escaped every time. For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night, thinking a moving person is harder to hit. In 1985, Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat. The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt. In 1992, the aircraft in which he was flying over North Africa broke in two during a crash landing. The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive. What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger. Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ram Allah in December 2001. When they saw the attackers coming, Arafat's bodyguards _ his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground. Seconds later, several bombs were dropped nearby. Though safe, his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat. But, Arafat, with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away, showed no fear at all. He stayed in the damaged office, talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel. All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others. But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell. According to the passage, which statement is true? A) In 1992, Arafat's plane crashed in South Africa. B) Israeli officers thought Arafat himself sent the terrorist groups to Israel. C) China is the only country against Israel's decision of removing Arafat. D) Being Palestinian leader, Arafat would rather die in his own country than be driven away from his people.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The metallic bonding model explains the physical properties of metals. Metals conduct electricity and heat very well because of their free-flowing electrons. As electrons enter one end of a piece of metal, an equal number of electrons flow outward from the other end. When light is shone on to the surface of a metal, its electrons absorb small amounts of energy and become excited into one of its many empty orbitals. The electrons immediately fall back down to lower energy levels and emit light. This process is responsible for the high luster of metals. Q: Why does metal conduct heat and electricity so well?

Last year, the Scottish capital was captivated by a series of intricate book sculptures, mysteriously gracing various locations in the city—silent love-letters to art, left by an invisible admirer. This year, this enigmatic artist has returned, intertwining mystery with creativity all over again, producing five new riveting works of book craft. Step 2: Remind and describe briefly about the last year's event to create continuity Last year, the anonymous artist left the city and its residents in awe with the sight of unique, meticulously crafted sculptures; each piece an artful exploration of used books turned into intricate designs. These pieces, found at historic sites, parks, and libraries throughout the city, brought a different kind of vigor to the thriving cultural scene of Edinburgh. Step 3: Introduce the new works, building anticipation In 2022, Edinburgh has once again found itself the canvas for this anonymous artist's work. Five new book sculptures have appeared in undisclosed locations, continuing the tradition of surprise and intrigue. The sculptural works encompass an unparalleled vision, with each piece once again repurposing old books into complex, detailed forms and figures that are whimsical and spirited. Step 4: Delve into a description of the new sculptures and their impact on the city The new sculptures echo the patterns of the old, swathed in mystery and anticipation.

Step 5: Reflect on the curiosity surrounding the anonymous artist The question of who is behind these amazing sculptures has once again emerged, stirring the city's curiosity. Speculation abounds; however, the protective veil of anonymity still remains unfurling, adding to the lure and delight of the artistic expressions. Step 6: Conclude by suggesting the impact of such activity and looking forward to more such expressions The mysterious book sculptures of Edinburgh, old and new, invite not only admiration for their technique but a sense of communal joy and discovery that threads its way through the city’s heart. As the city celebrates these new additions, residents and visitors alike wait in eager anticipation of where and when the next piece of this intriguing art puzzle might emerge.

Blood Legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer Tom Drake (Norman Bartold) to the Dean estate formerly owned by the now deceased Christopher Dean (John Carradine), upon his arrival he is greeted by Mr. Dean's four children, Gregory (Jeff Morrow) & his wife Laura (Merry Anders), Victoria (Faith Domergue), Johnny (Richard Davalos) plus Leslie (Brooke Mills) & her fella Carl Isenberg (John Smith). Drake plays a tape recording of they're late Father's wishes after his death, the estate worth 136 million dollars is to be split equally between his four children, if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest & if all were to die the freaky servants Elga (Ivy Bethune), Igor (Buck Kartalian) & the more mundanely named Frank (John Russell) would pocket the lot. Well, not satisfied with a quarter share of 136 million (which is still almost 35 million back in 1971 which doesn't sound too bad to me) someone decides they want it all for themselves & it's not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the fridge... Co-written, produced & directed by Roy Monson Blood Legacy disappointed me on two accounts. For starters this film's alternate & much more common title is Legacy of Blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by Andy Milliagn back in '78 which I've always wanted to see, both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories & when I checked my on screen cable TV guide for Legacy of Blood I was excited because it said it was the Milligan film & even listed him as director so when I actually sat down to watch it & I heard John Carradine's voice & I then knew it wasn't the Milligan film that I had wanted to see, my heart sank. Then, of course, there's the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that Blood Legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times. The script by Monson & Eric Norden is slow, boring & extremely predictable. The character's are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way, the freak of a servant who ask's his sister (?) to cane him, the strange set of Brother's & Sisters who are just downright unlikeable & so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic whodunit story could have achieved is sorely missing & then there's the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first 10 minutes. It's boring to watch, it's poorly paced & it's just a chore to even think about it. Please, someone save me as this is really bad stuff. I could go on all day about how bad Blood Legacy is, I really could. Director Monson was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he shouldn't have even been directing traffic. The entire film looks ugly, it's poorly photographed & there is no atmosphere or scares. The blood & gore is tame, there's an axe in a head, a decapitated head, a scene when someone is stung to death by wasp's & the best murder when someone's face is eaten by piranha. However there are question marks over this scene, so there's the victim, right. There's the tank of piranha, right. Victims head is placed in piranha tank, right. Pirahna eat victims face, right. Water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten, erm where's the blood? Technically Blood Legacy is terrible, it looks awful, the sound was obviously shot live & it's muffled & hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a blessing in disguise. The acting was not going to win anyone any awards that's for sure, the least said about it the better. Blood Legacy is an awful film, there really isn't a single positive aspect to it or if there is I can't think of it.

Allow each bead with a hole to dry completely. See instructions above for remaining steps.","completion":"The article provides instructions on how to handle and dry beads during a crafting or jewelry-making process. It emphasizes the importance of setting the beads out to dry on a wire rack instead of allowing them to dry completely. This intermediate drying stage ensures that the beads are still slightly wet so they can be better manipulated, making it easier for artisans to work with them. To begin with, the beads should be carefully placed on a wire rack, ensuring that they are evenly spaced. This prevents them from sticking together and allows proper airflow, facilitating even drying. It is important not to let the beads dry completely at this stage, as they may become too brittle or stiff, and this could hinder the overall beadwork execution or jeopardize the project. For beads with holes in them, the drying process should be completed until they are entirely dry. This ensures that the hole stays intact and can be used to connect different beads or components when creating jewelry, accessories, or other craft projects. After achieving the proper drying level for each type of bead, users should refer to the specified instructions on any additional necessary steps. These steps might include stringing, painting, glazing, or any other required technique depending on the specific project being undertaken. In summary, the drying process of beads is an essential aspect of crafting and creating unique accessories. The article reminds users to carefully dry the beads on a wire rack, preventing them from drying too much or too little.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which farm had more overstory trees with fairly open canopies? Two coffee farms used different methods to grow coffee. Hill farm grown coffee conventionally, while Valley farm is into shade-grown coffee production. Hint: With shade applications, crops are purposely raised under tree canopies within the shady environment. The understory crops are shade tolerant or the overstory trees have fairly open canopies. A conspicuous example is shade-grown coffee. This practice reduces weeding costs and improves coffee quality and taste. The shade does not necessarily translate into lost or reduced yields. This is because the rate of photosynthesis hardly increases once the light intensity is over about one tenth that of direct overhead sunlight and declines with increasing light intensity. This means that shaded plants can grow well. Planting more than one level of vegetation can increase total photosynthesis and overall yields.","completion":"Valley farm had more overstory trees with fairly open canopies, as it is the farm that practices shade-grown coffee production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The reported margin of error is typically about twice the standard deviation ­– the radius of a 95 percent confidence interval . Question: what is standard deviation in statistics A:","completion":"No, the provided answer does not directly define standard deviation in statistics. Let me give you a detailed answer to the question: Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion or variability in a dataset. In statistics, it is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (average) of the dataset, while a high standard deviation shows that the values are spread out over a larger range. It is especially helpful when comparing the variability within two or more datasets. The standard deviation can be calculated as follows: 1. Find the mean (average) of the dataset. 2. Subtract the mean from each data point and square the result (this gives you the squared deviations). 3. Calculate the average of these squared deviations. 4. Take the square root of the result obtained in step 3. Mathematically, the standard deviation (σ), for a dataset with n values (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) and mean (μ), can be computed using this formula: σ = √[(Σ(xᵢ - μ)²)/n] In summary, standard deviation is a measure that helps evaluate the variability or spread of a dataset in statistics.

The story follows the lives of two strangers, John (played by the phenomenal Tom Williams) and Sarah (an incredible performance by Emma Clarke), who cross paths one fateful day and form an unlikely bond. The narrative is beautifully woven, unfolding with a gentle pace that allows the audience to immerse themselves into the characters' lives. Each scene is filled with raw emotion and vulnerability, every frame a masterpiece of cinematography. Tom Williams and Emma Clarke deliver powerhouse performances, deftly exploring the intricacies of their characters while maintaining a natural chemistry on-screen. Their deeply moving portrayals leave a lasting impression, tugging on the heartstrings of audiences long after the credits have rolled. The supporting cast also shines, with each member adeptly breathing life into their respective roles. Cinematographer James Bentley's work on this film is nothing short of spectacular. From sweeping panoramas to intimate, close-up shots, the visual narrative is as much a part of the story as the characters themselves. Bentley masterfully portrays the subtle interplay between light and shadow, meticulously crafting each shot for maximum impact. The result is a visual feast that enchants the viewer and enhances the emotional impact of the film. The musical score by Oscar-winning composer David Lang is an auditory delight. The original soundtrack is the perfect accompaniment to the film's narrative, evoking moments of profound joy, sorrow, hope, and reflection. Lang's masterful use of melodies and motifs truly elevates Radiant Horizons to new heights. In conclusion, Radiant Horizons stands as a shining example of the power of cinema to bring people together and touch hearts.

Write a \\"(1).\\" movie review (OPTIONS: (1). negative (2). positive).","completion":"(1). Negative Movie Review: \\"Chaos Unleashed\\" Chaos Unleashed, directed by renowned director James Belton, promised to be an adrenaline-pumping, intense cinematic experience filled with nail-biting action, charismatic characters, and an engaging storyline. Unfortunately, it turns out to be an exhausting hodgepodge of poorly executed elements that not only makes you regret the two hours and forty minutes you spent watching it but also leaves you questioning its very existence in the first place. The film starts with a promising premise: A team of professional thieves led by the suave yet enigmatic protagonist, Jack Strider played by Vincent Vane, is brought together for a high-stakes heist. But the moment the plan is set into motion, the movie turns into a puzzling series of badly choreographed action sequences and poorly-written dialogues that leave you questioning the director's intentions and the writers' sense of logic. As the plot unfolds, one cannot help but notice the glaring plot holes and inconsistencies that riddle the storyline. The twists and turns, which are meant to keep the audience on the edge of their seats, become increasingly convoluted and unconvincing as the film progresses. To add insult to injury, the climax falls flat with nothing more than a tasteless fusion of overused tropes that are most likely to trigger a barrage of facepalms. The acting in Chaos Unleashed is just as terrible as its story. The usually talented Vincent Vane delivers an agonizingly forced and unconvincing performance that makes no attempt to bring depth or complexity to the character of Jack Strider. The supporting characters, played by a star-studded cast, struggle to shine amid an array of dull and predictable dialogues. As a result, most of the performances are reduced to caricaturish versions of established action heroes. Even the action scenes, which should have been the film's saving grace, turn out to be disappointing. Instead of innovative, intensely choreographed sequences, the viewer is treated to an endless display of shoddy green screen work, poor CGI, and a blatant misuse of practical effects. The much-anticipated chase sequence comes across as a lackluster pursuit with stunt work that does little to invoke a sense of excitement or thrill. Moreover, Chaos Unleashed suffers immensely on the technical front as well. The film's pacing is erratic, switching between unbearably slow and jarringly rapid, making it difficult to maintain any semblance of investment in the story. The editing is choppy, with abrupt cuts that often obscure the flow of action. The score, composed by the highly regarded Alan Louis, is one of the primary letdowns of the film. It feels as if ripped straight out of a low-budget video game, and fails to elevate the intensity of any given scene. In conclusion, Chaos Unleashed is a colossally underwhelming movie that, despite its promising premise and talented cast, crashes and burns under the weight of its poor execution and lack of creativity. While diehard fans of the genre may still find some fleeting moments of enjoyment, the majority of viewers will most likely exit the theater feeling drained, confused and utterly disappointed by this squandered opportunity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Big cities are rarely home to thriving farmlands, but a group of Dutch architects hope to change that with the \\"Park Supermarket\\" -- an urban farming project that will attempt to grow and sell all the food of a modern supermarket in one place. The firm behind the proposal, Rotterdam-based Van Bergen Kolpa Architects, intends to produce everything from risotto rice, to kiwis to Tilapia fish all on one 4,000-acre plot of disused land in Randstad, Holland's largest metropolitan area. In defiance of the country's moderate climate, the architects say they have devised a system to control the park's outdoor environment, using old and new farming technologies to simulate Mediterranean and tropical climates in an ecologically sustainable way. The land, which had been earmarked for a large block of business developments before the global recession, cuts across the city fringes of Rotterdam and The Hague, serving a potential customer-base of over one million people, according to Van Bergen Kolpa Architects. \\"The cities surrounding the proposed site are home to 170 different eating cultures -- from Moroccan to Indonesian, from Turkish to Chinese -- and we're aiming to grow food to satisfy all their tastes,\\" said Jago van Bergen, an award-winning architect and one of the brains behind the \\"Park Supermarket\\" -- which has been shortlisted for the upcoming World Architecture Awards in November. \\"The plan is to divide the park into three climate zones -- moderate, Mediterranean and tropical. Because this will also be a recreational space, our goal is to make it as open as possible, without using greenhouses,\\" he said. But how exactly do you create a warm outdoor microclimate on the urban fringes of a north European city? According to van Bergen, it's not as far-fetched or futuristic as it sounds. \\"The main differences between a Mediterranean and moderate climate are longer periods of light and warmth in the evening, \\" he explained. \\"To make up this difference we'll use a combination of traditional and modern farming methods that all work by trapping and storing heat and releasing it when temperatures drop,\\" So, in an effort to grow typically Mediterranean foods like olives and peppers, for instance, van Bergen says he'll need little more than rows of \\"snake walls\\" and \\"climate pylons.\\" According to van Bergen, \\"snake walls\\", made from clay, curve over crops helping to shield them from cold winds, while simultaneously emitting heat absorbed during the day. \\"They used this method in the 18th century gardens of eastern Germany's Potsdam, so the king could grow grapes to make wine that tasted as good as the French stuff,\\" he said. \\"Climate pylons\\" are a more modern method of trapping heat. Van Bergen says they simply rain down a fine mist of water from high up, creating clouds that act like vapor roofs, stopping warm air from disappearing into the sky. However, for tropical foods like mangoes and basmati rice, van Bergen says the park will need another layer of warmth. \\"In this case, we'll pump geothermal energy -- heat stored deep in the lower soils -- up to the top using underground pipes filled with water,\\" he explained. \\"This technology is used in football stadiums to stop the pitches freezing over and more recently it's being used to heat homes.\\" Van Bergen concedes that the pumps and electric-powered lights that artificially extend daylight hours will require an additional input of energy, but claims that it will all be met by local renewable sources. Read related: 'Living' buildings could inhale city carbon emissions. The Park Supermarket was commissioned by planning officials from the South Holland Province, and plans are afoot for a small test site to be up and running by the end of this year. If successful, the firm believes this type of system could form part of a new approach to sustainable farming, making use of urban greenbelts while helping to reduce the carbon footprint associated with food production -- which accounts for up to 30% of total emissions worldwide, according to a 2008 Greenpeace report. \\"The dominant food-production system is based on fossil fuel at every level,\\" said Dr Martin Caraher, professor of food and health policy at London's City University. \\"It needs oil to make the fertilizer, oil for the farm, oil for the food processing, oil for the packaging and oil to transport it to the shops,\\" he added. Van Bergen says the park will reduce carbon emissions by cutting down on food processing and transport costs, while stimulating local industry and social bonds. \\"Because all the food in our supermarket will be grown on site we won't need a big processing factory to make packaging and we won't have to burn lots of fossil fuel to transport it across the globe,\\" he said. However, the Park Supermarket concept does not appeal to everyone. \\"Anything that reduces food miles and other carbon emissions linked to food production is normally a positive thing,\\" said Dr Nicola Canon, lecturer in crop sciences at the UK's Royal Agricultural College. \\"However, I have reservations about any system that creates open artificial climates. \\"We know that we are suffering from climate change, with one area enduring long wet spells while another goes through a prolonged drought. I wonder if we really ought to be exploring technologies that seek to control our already unpredictable weather cycles.\\" Canon is also concerned that the introduction of alien climates may also precipitate the introduction of alien pests. \\"Every time you raise humidity, you raise disease affectability -- because where you have good conditions for growth you also have good conditions for disease to grow. I think creating tropical climates next to moderate ones could introduce a host of new diseases and pests to the region in quite an unpredictable way,\\" she warned. Finally, while Canon says she appreciates what van Bergen and his team are trying to do, she doubts that the system could be replicated on a wider scale. \\"In my experience, it takes a lot of resources to create a relatively small microclimate. This means land that could otherwise be used for growing native crops is taken up with technology -- whether it be rows and rows of snake walls or climate pylons or whatever,\\" she said. For van Bergen, this type of criticism misses the point, because he sees the Park Supermarket as just one of many possible alternatives to the existing system of food production. \\"I'm not a preacher of any one form of agriculture,\\" he said. \\"Just like our energy, I think our future food supplies will have to come from a variety of sources, using a variety of methods -- of which we are sure this will be one. \\"But this is about more than sustainable, non-intensive farming, it's about cultivating community ties and giving new meaning to a space on the edge of the city that is currently being used for very little else.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The Park Supermarket is an innovative urban farming project proposed by Van Bergen Kolpa Architects, based in the Netherlands. The Rotterdam-based firm aims to grow and sell a wide variety of food, including rice, kiwis, and fish, on a 4,000-acre plot of disused land in Holland's largest metropolitan area, Randstad. The architects will use both old and new farming technologies to create Mediterranean and tropical climate zones within the park in a sustainable manner. The park will be divided into three climate zones: moderate, Mediterranean, and tropical. This will allow for the cultivation of diverse foods that cater to the 170 different eating cultures present in the surrounding cities. The implementation of traditional and modern farming methods will help trap and store heat, which in turn will be released when temperatures drop.

Last week , I was in the kitchen while both kids were playing in the backyard . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why would an injured player ultimately play in the game ?","completion":"An injured player may ultimately decide to play in a game for various reasons, which can vary from personal motivations to external pressures. Some of the main reasons include: 1. Professional commitment: Playing hurt signifies a strong sense of duty and commitment to the team, coach, and fans. Athletes understand that their presence and performance on the field can significantly impact the outcome of a game. They may feel compelled to participate, even when dealing with physical pain or discomfort, to fulfill their professional obligations. 2. Financial considerations: Athletes, particularly those in professional sports, receive considerable salaries and bonuses. They might be more inclined to play through injuries to secure their income and maintain their value as an asset to the team. Additionally, performance incentives or clauses in contracts could motivate an injured player to participate in a game to achieve those financial benefits. 3. Fear of losing a position: In the competitive world of sports, athletes may worry that taking time off to recover from an injury might provide an opportunity for a teammate or competitor to take their spot on the team. Playing hurt could be a way to demonstrate dedication and maintain a secure position on the roster. 4. Team dynamics: Athletes often develop strong bonds with their teammates and have a deep sense of loyalty to their team. An injured player might choose to play in a game to support the team's success and not let their teammates down, especially in critical matches or moments in the season. 5. Passion for the game: Many athletes have a deep love for their sport and derive great satisfaction from participating in games. This passion can be a powerful motivator to play hurt, as the desire to be on the field or court outweighs the discomfort or pain associated with an injury. 6. Culture of toughness: Sports often foster a culture that values physical resilience and mental toughness. Athletes might feel pressure, either internally or externally, to display stoicism when dealing with injuries. Playing through pain can be seen as a testament to their character and dedication. 7. Optimal recovery strategies: In some cases, playing with minor injuries may not significantly exacerbate the issue. With appropriate medical guidance and treatment, it might be deemed safe for the player to continue participating in games while managing their injury. However, it is crucial for athletes, coaches, and support staff to carefully assess the risks and potential long-term consequences of playing hurt. In the best interest of the player's health and career longevity, the decision to participate in a game despite an injury should be guided by objective evaluations of the player's condition and the understanding that physical well-being should always be a priority."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Questions: What can happen when eating breakfast but not choosing the amount of food correctly? Options: - indigestion - heartburn - stomach ache - gain energy - overeating A:","completion":"When eating breakfast but not choosing the amount of food correctly, various outcomes can occur as a result. It is essential to have a sense of the correct portion size for your own individual needs in order to maintain balance and overall health. While all the options provided may potentially happen, I will delve into each scenario in more detail to give a comprehensive understanding. 1. Indigestion: Overeating or eating too quickly during breakfast may cause indigestion. Indigestion occurs when your stomach has difficulty breaking down and processing the food, leading to symptoms such as bloating, gas, and nausea. Eating an excessive amount or eating too quickly can overwhelm your digestive system, causing discomfort and indigestion. To prevent this, eating mindfully and ensuring not to consume too much food at once can help. 2. Heartburn: Eating the wrong type of foods or consuming large portions can also trigger heartburn. Heartburn happens when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, leading to a burning sensation in the chest. Choosing foods that are high in fat, acidic, or spicy can contribute to heartburn during breakfast. Reducing portion sizes and selecting healthier food options can help alleviate this issue. 3. Stomach ache: Eating too much or consuming foods that your body is sensitive or intolerant to can result in a stomach ache. Pain and abdominal discomfort may occur when the stomach struggles to digest the food properly or when it experiences too much pressure due to excessive food intake. Monitoring your portion sizes carefully and being mindful of food sensitivities can help prevent stomach aches during breakfast. 4. Gain energy: When you consume the right amount and type of food for breakfast, it can provide you with the energy you need to kick-start your day. A balanced breakfast consisting of proteins, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats will provide you with sustainable energy throughout the morning, improving mental clarity and overall performance. Choosing the correct amount of food plays a crucial role in reaping these energy-boosting benefits. 5. Overeating: When you fail to choose the appropriate amount of food for breakfast, you run the risk of overeating. Overeating frequently can lead to weight gain and put additional strain on your digestive system. It is crucial to identify your hunger cues and recognize when you have consumed enough food to prevent overeating. Implementing portion control strategies and eating slowly can assist in avoiding this issue. In summary, choosing the appropriate amount of food for breakfast is imperative to support optimal digestion, prevent discomfort, and provide the necessary energy for your day. Failing to select the correct portion size can lead to indigestion, heartburn, stomach ache, and overeating. However, when managed effectively and mindfully, breakfast can be an excellent source of energy and essential nutrients to start your day on a positive note."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A Nation's Vigil of Hope and Loss SENDAI, Japan—The Iwanuma City Fitness Center, the local gymnasium of a town that suffered the twin blows of Friday's earthquake and tsunami, has in recent days become a makeshift morgue. A four-month-old girl was rescued in Ishinomaki. Inside the nondescript white building on Monday were 53 bodies, nine of them still unidentified, that rescuers had pulled from mud and debris nearby. Outside, in the parking lot, small groups huddled in mourning. An elderly man walked out of the building, his legs appearing to buckle. Some here were distraught because they had found a loved one inside. Others were distraught because they hadn't. Morgue workers expected worse to come. \\"We think tomorrow will be the busy day,\\" a Red Cross official at the Iwanuma gym said Monday. \\"The military will be bringing in more bodies.\\" Facilities like this one, 20 miles south of the big city of Sendai, have cropped up all along Japan's devastated northeastern coastline to receive bodies found as floodwaters subside from Friday's tsunami. They form part of the new fabric of life in this zone—one of morgues, evacuation centers and vast, unreachable expanses of mud mixed with trees and fire extinguishers, tatami mats and minivans, doors and roofs. By early Tuesday, Japan's government said 2,400 people had died from Friday's 9.0-magnitude quake and the waves that followed. The toll is expected to rise as Japan increases the number of Self-Defense Force troops it is deploying to search and rescue operations—to 100,000, up from an initial deployment of 50,000—and continues to push into now-impassable areas. According to some news reports, some towns have been all but washed away. \\"There are isolated areas we still cannot reach,\\" a Self-Defense Force spokesman said Monday. He said survivors remain stranded in schools and other buildings in towns such as Onagawa, north of Sendai. \\"We are trying to rescue them with our helicopters. First, we need to find a place where the choppers can land.\\" Relief workers say they are growing less optimistic of finding survivors. \\"Yesterday they found someone alive,\\" said one policeman from Tokyo who arrived Saturday to help out. \\"Mostly, they just find bodies.\\" In a middle-school gymnasium in the nearby town of Arahama, now an evacuation center, four easel-size sheets of paper were filled with messages written by people seeking news of loved ones. \\"Erika Fujita was last seen near the Family-Mart in the second district of Arahama. If she is unharmed, please call her mother. She is worried,\\" one note read. Nearby, a power strip was filled with charging mobile phones, their owners waiting for good news. Throughout Monday, defense forces arrived at Iwanuma's makeshift morgue with bodies found in waters that had rushed far inland. Police examined and photographed corpses. Families streamed into the fitness center to file missing persons' reports and look at the police photos. Outside a side door, a van from a local funeral company made multiple trips, carrying those that had been identified. Life in the middle of Sendai appeared strangely routine Monday, apart from the cracked buildings and closed shops. Some women walked in high heels. One woman rode her bicycle with now-precious groceries in the front basket. Toward the Pacific coast, however, were police checkpoints, cranes and the blaring sirens of fire trucks and ambulances. Onlookers are generally kept at least two miles from the sea. Even at that distance, fields of mud and debris can be seen stretching for miles. Covered in inches of dark shiny sludge is a rich stew: a bicycle, an Ultraman stuffed toy, a fire extinguisher, a bank book. A soccer ball. A wheelchair. \\"You can't use any of it,\\" said Shigeru Matsumoto, a farmer with a rice paddy in this area. \\"It's been ruined by the water.\\" Speaking at the middle-school evacuation center in Arahama, the 61-year-old said he had been outside at around 2:30 p.m. Friday, getting his land ready for planting, when the quake hit. Though he said it was the biggest of the many tremors he has felt over his lifetime, he stayed in his field, some two miles inland. Then came the fire trucks, the helicopters, the orders to evacuate. \\"They were saying we had to flee, because a tsunami was coming,\\" he said. \\"I didn't think the water could possibly come in that far.\\" As he was trying to finish up his work, he says he heard a great noise—\\"Crack! Crack! Crack,\\" is how he describes it. He looked to see water and wood flying into the air in the distance. He jumped into his car. Tracing a diagram of his evacuation path on the dust of the floor, he described driving down a narrow road between the rice paddies. \\"One wrong turn and my wheel would get stuck, and it would be over,\\" he said. At a corner where the road turned left, away from the ocean, he said he could see the water rising. \\"It was there right in front of me,\\" he said. Mr. Matsumoto said he has returned to his home and found that the earthquake damaged it beyond repair. His land, he presumes, lies under muck. With many roads impassable to cars, he has salvaged a bicycle and has been helping a friend clean out his home in an area where residents have been permitted to return. \\"You would not believe what was washed in,\\" said Mr. Matsumoto, proudly gesturing to the muddy jumpsuit and rubber boots he had worn to clean the home. Mr. Matsumoto—who says he turned to farming after a life as a salaryman in a job he declined to name—says he wants to farm again. His resolve is tempered by thoughts of a friend's disappeared daughter and of the wall of water he just outran. Lowering his voice, he considers the thousands the government says are likely to have died. \\"I think it is tens of thousands,\\" he said.

This is a more efficient and thorough cleaning method. Option [A] suggests using a sponge and cleaning solution.

In the days following the first anniversary of my dad 's death, I felt sad. I still missed him so much. I would walk over to his old house where my daughter now live and still expect to see him sitting out on his front porch . I would see him in my dreams, looking young and strong again. I felt bad too because I regretted not spending more time with him while he was here. I wished I had visited him more, talked with him more, and listened to him more. I wished I had asked the questions that I never did. I wished I had given him more hugs and told him I loved him more often. I wished I had cherished the time I had with him here. I was angry at the destiny because Dad and Mum had both passed away before I was 50, and I was angry with myself because I hadn't made the most of time I had with them. Today, I found myself walking under a cloudy sky, staring at the leafless trees. As I walked along, one of the last golden maple leaves fell from its tree and sailed in the wind until it landed in front of me. I picked it up and smiled.

Austin sold their shared in the market and the others saw that if they did not do the same they would lose all their money forever. Given the context: What will Others want to do next? Possible answers: Decide to keep their shares in the market, Trade in their shares, support others to also sell their shares","completion":"Based on the context presented, the 'Others' would likely want to 'Trade in their shares'. This is because the context suggests that the action Austin took - selling his shares - is perceived by 'Others' as a sensible move to prevent potential total loss. The phrase \\"if they did not do the same they would lose all their money forever\\" implies that the 'Others' are in a situation where not following Austin's example could lead to substantial financial loss. Therefore, the most logical action for the 'Others' to take, to avoid the anticipated loss, would be to also 'Trade in their shares'. The other two options 'Decide to keep their shares in the market' and 'support others to also sell their shares' are less likely. The first one contradicts the urgency and threat of loss indicated in the context, while the second option could be a possible subsequent action once they've decided to sell their own shares, but not the immediate one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Answer:","completion":"The common term for the chemical formula H2O is \\"water.\\" Water is a simple and ubiquitous compound that can be found all over the Earth in various forms, such as liquid, solid (ice), and gas (water vapor). It is composed of two hydrogen atoms (H) and one oxygen atom (O), hence the chemical representation of H2O. Water is essential for the existence and survival of all known forms of life. It serves as a medium for various biochemical reactions that take place in living organisms, including humans. It is also involved in temperature regulation, nutrient transport, waste elimination, and many other critical biological processes. The unique properties of water, such as its high heat capacity, high surface tension, and its ability to dissolve a wide variety of substances, have earned it the title of the \\"universal solvent.\\" This characteristic makes water indispensable in various natural and industrial processes. In Earth's hydrological cycle, water evaporates from the surface (mostly due to solar heat) and rises into the atmosphere, where it cools down and condenses into clouds. The water eventually returns to the Earth's surface in the form of precipitation (rain, snow, or other forms), replenishing the water sources like rivers, lakes, and oceans. Apart from its biological significance, water also plays a critical role in various social, economic, and industrial activities. It is used in agriculture for irrigation, in industries for manufacturing and cooling processes, and for domestic purposes like cooking, cleaning, and drinking. Furthermore, water has cultural and religious importance in many societies. Different religions have their unique ways of symbolizing water or using it in their rituals and ceremonies. In conclusion, the chemical formula H2O, commonly known as water, possesses distinctive chemical and physical properties that make it a vital component for life and various natural processes on Earth. It is not only essential for life's sustenance but also influences multiple aspects of human society, including agriculture, industry, and cultural practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

CHAPTER XXIV Enid, my early and my only love, I thought, but that your father came between, In former days you saw me favourably, And if it were so, do not keep it back, Make me a little happier, let me know it.--TENNYSON The foreign tour proved a great success. The summer in the Alps was delightful. The complete change gave Bertha new life, bodily strength first returning, and then mental activity. The glacier system was a happy exchange for her _ego_, and she observed and enjoyed with all the force of her acute intelligence and spirit of inquiry, while Phoebe was happy in doing her duty by profiting by all opportunities of observation, in taking care of Maria and listening to Mervyn, and Miss Charlecote enjoyed scenery, poetry, art, and natural objects with relish keener than even that of her young friends, who were less impressible to beauty in every shape. Mervyn behaved very well to her, knowing himself bound to make the journey agreeable to her; he was constantly kind to Bertha, and in the pleasure of her revival submitted to a wonderful amount of history and science. All his grumbling was reserved for the private ear of Phoebe, whose privilege it always was to be his murmuring block, and who was only too thankful to keep to herself his discontents whenever his route was not chosen (and often when it was), his disgusts with inns, railroads, and sights and his impatience of all pursuits save Bertha's. Many a time she was permitted to see and hear nothing but how much he was bored, but on the whole the growls were so mitigated compared with what she had known, that it was almost contentment; and that he did not absolutely dislike their habits was plain from his adherence to the ladies, though he might have been quite independent of them. 1.

Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible.

Information: - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - John Michael \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English singer, songwriter, and actor.

Journalist Geoff Barton coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper \\"Sounds\\" to describe the emergence of new heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music. - A bassist, or bass player, is a musician who plays a bass instrument such as a double bass, bass guitar, keyboard bass or a low brass instrument such as a tuba or sousaphone. Different musical genres tend to be associated with one or more of these instruments. Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for funk, R&B, soul music, rock and roll, reggae, jazz fusion, heavy metal, country and pop music. The double bass is the standard bass instrument for classical music, bluegrass, rockabilly, and most genres of jazz. Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in Dixieland and New Orleans-style jazz bands.

When he was arrested at his Chicago home in 2012 for hacking the website of security think tank Stratfor, the dreadlocked Jeremy Hammond was the FBI's most wanted cybercriminal. Authorities tracked him down with the help of top LulzSec member Hector Xavier Monsegur. But it has never been known how they managed to search his encrypted computer, the lid of which the hacker was able to close as agents armed with assault rifles were raiding his home. An Associated Press profile of the 29-year-old's life behind bars provides a possible answer. Hammond's password was \\"Chewy 123.\\" Hashing algorithms protecting encryption keys are by design extremely slow, making cracking attacks harder to carry out. The more guesses the attacker tries the exponentially longer it will take. As demonstrated in previous Ars articles such as Why passwords have never been weaker—and crackers have never been stronger and Anatomy of a hack: How crackers ransack passwords like “qeadzcwrsfxv1331”, \\"Chewy 123\\" would be among the earlier candidates any experienced cracker would try. And assuming agents performed any research on their then suspect, \\"Chewy 123\\" would almost certainly have been near the top of the list. \\"Chewy,\\" it turns out, was the name of Hammond's cat. Brief updated in the first paragraph to clarify how Hammond encrypted his data. ||||| MANCHESTER, Ky. (AP) — Cocaine dealers, bank robbers and carjackers converge at Manchester Federal Prison in rural Kentucky — and then there is Jeremy Hammond, a tousle-haired and talented hacker whose nimble fingers have clicked and tapped their way into the nation's computing systems. Among those whose data he helped expose: the husband of the federal judge who sentenced him. \\"From the start, I always wanted to target government websites, but also police and corporations that profit off government contracts,\\" he says. \\"I hacked lots of dot-govs.\\" An Associated Press report this week found the 10 billion-a-year effort to protect the federal government's extensive computer systems is struggling to keep up with a daily bombardment of cyberattacks from thieves and hostile states that grab Social Security numbers, peruse Pentagon secrets and hijack critical websites. Human error, by way of employee missteps, is often to blame. Those behind these incidents are a motley group: foreign spies, intellectual property thieves, personal identity peddlers, and, increasingly, politically motivated hacktivists like Hammond. Once the FBI's most-wanted cybercriminal, Hammond is serving one of the longest sentences a U.S. hacker has received — 10 years, the maximum allowed under his plea agreement last year. \\"This is the nicest room in the place,\\" he said when the AP recently sat down with him in a drab cinderblock visiting room to talk about how and why he did what he did. Prison authorities barred cameras and recorders, citing security. A hacktivist for more than a decade, Hammond, 29, was arrested in 2012 after penetrating the U.S.-based security think tank Stratfor, whose clients include the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department. He'd been working with a subgroup of the loose-knit hacking movement \\"Anonymous\\" to disrupt the networks of Sony Pictures, the Public Broadcasting Service, the Arizona Department of Public Safety and others when a member of the group enlisted him to help break into Stratfor's systems. Some breaches in Hammond's life had been a challenge. He'd search the code on websites he wanted to target, combing through the symbols and letters of computing languages for security flaws to exploit. He'd create user accounts on the sites, and then test for ways in. It could take months of trying, and sometimes he gave up. But the Stratfor hack was a cinch, he said. Basic security was not in place, a flaw later acknowledged by Stratfor CEO George Friedman. \\"We did not encrypt credit card files,\\" Friedman said. \\"This was our failure.\\" Hammond was like a kid in a candy shop: \\"I was like damn man, this is crazy.\\" The hackers posted emails between Stratfor employees and clients on the WikiLeaks website (some 5 million exchanges, they claimed), along with credit card data from a client list that included Northrop Grumman, the Marine Corps and Time Warner Cable. They used some of the credit card numbers to donate money to the Red Cross, according to court records. Among the thousands whose emails were disclosed was the husband of the federal judge who sentenced Hammond. She chose not to recuse herself, noting that no harm was done. Her husband's email address was exposed but already publicly available, and no actual correspondence or credit card information was revealed. Federal prosecutors said the Stratfor hack resulted in more than a million dollars in losses to individuals, and threatened public safety. A hacking \\"recidivist,\\" they called Hammond. Raised in the Chicago suburb of Glendale Heights with his twin brother Jason by their father, a musician, Hammond said he was a \\"nonconformist, anti-authority\\" kid. At 8, he tried his hand at designing video games. A few years later, he started hacking. Then came 9/11. Hammond was 16, and considered some of the government's anti-terrorism actions \\"police state measures.\\" \\"I had a sense of duty to take action,\\" he said. With his brother, he protested, started an underground school newspaper and then organized a high school walkout when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. That year, Hammond also launched HackThisSite.org, where hackers of all skill levels can hone their abilities and share tips. He considered hacking a means of social justice, and he did it in secret while pursuing civil disobedience and protest in public, as well. He started the University of Illinois at Chicago with a full scholarship, cooked and gave food to homeless people and set up a free public computer lab. He also hacked into the university's computer science department website, and then told administrators about the vulnerability. They kicked him out, according to court records. That summer, at 19, with a black scarf tied around his neck, Hammond was both heckled and cheered as he encouraged the audience at the hacking conference DEFCON to engage in a campaign of \\"electronic civil disobedience\\" against the upcoming Republican National Convention in New York. \\"There's going to be a series of defacements, financial disruption, email flood campaigns,\\" he promised, and some GOP websites did later report technical difficulties. As Hammond's social and political actions mounted, so did his arrest record. He pleaded guilty to battery after fighting with anti-gay protesters at a Chicago Pride Parade and was again taken to jail after joining hundreds of counter-demonstrators at a neo-Nazi rally. A hack into the website of a group that was harassing Iraq War opponents got Hammond sentenced, in 2008, to 20 months in federal prison. Once out, he got involved in local activist movements, then public protests and then more hacking. Working from a coffee shop or inside a vacant building with Wi-Fi nearby, Hammond used a Tor web browser that prevents people from learning the user's location, and he identified himself only with nicknames including \\"Anarchaos\\" and \\"crediblethreat.\\" He always had a day job — at a computer repair store and, later, as a web developer for an advertising firm. Hammond's brother, who lived with him, told the sentencing judge that \\"no one around him had any inkling that he was getting involved in the group called Anonymous.\\" Three months after the Stratfor leak, on March 5, 2012, Hammond was smoking pot and chatting with friends in the kitchen of his Chicago home when the front door was kicked in. Someone threw a flash bang. \\"There were all these dudes with assault rifles,\\" he said. Everyone else hit the floor, but Hammond dashed to his bedroom to slam shut his encrypted Mac laptop. The FBI caught Hammond with the assistance of Hector Xavier Monsegur, a famous hacker known as Sabu who helped law enforcement infiltrate Anonymous and convict eight hackers in all. Hammond, up for release in 2020, spends his days folding laundry and sewing, studying Spanish, playing chess and reading books supporters send him. Asked about the larger danger posed by cybercriminals, he laughed at the idea that some consider such attacks as threatening to national security as terrorism. \\"I mean, I didn't kill anybody,\\" he said. At the same time, he knows the risk of nation states or others using a computer to do harm is real. \\"If I was capable of doing these things on my own or with my team, what about a well-financed team that trained for years?\\" To this day, Hammond is unsure how agents cracked his encryption program and got what they needed to land him back in prison. But he has one idea: \\"My password was really weak.\\" It was his cat. \\"Chewy,\\" he said, looking down at his hands. \\"Chewy 123.\\" ___ Follow Martha Mendoza at https://twitter.com/mendozamartha ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Hacker Jeremy Hammond, who was once the FBI's most-wanted cybercriminal, has explained how his former hacking collective LulzSec compromised the security of US-based think tank Stratfor in 2012.

Which person inherited a parcel with fewer grass root systems in its soil? Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Sad stories do exist in large numbers for the past lottery winners and that's why some financial experts say \\"70 percent of lottery winners will squander away winning within a few years.\\" Some end up losing all within two years, family relationships destroyed or even worse.

The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after.

Movie title: The Ides of March Context: Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is the junior campaign manager for Mike Morris, Governor of Pennsylvania and a Democratic presidential candidate, competing against Arkansas Senator Ted Pullman in the Democratic primary. Both campaigns are attempting to secure the endorsement of North Carolina Democratic Senator Franklin Thompson (Jeffrey Wright), who controls 356 convention delegates, enough to clinch the nomination for either candidate. After a debate at Miami University, Meyers is asked by Pullman's campaign manager, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), to meet in secret. Meyers calls his boss, senior campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who doesn't answer. Meyers decides to meet Duffy, who offers Meyers a position in Pullman's campaign, an offer Meyers refuses. Zara calls Meyers back and asks what was important, but Meyers says it was nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, Meyers starts a sexual relationship with Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood), an attractive intern for Morris's campaign and daughter of Jack Stearns, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Meyers admits to an angry Zara that he met with Duffy, and that Duffy said his candidate will offer Thompson the position of Secretary of State, guaranteeing Pullman's victory. Zara and Meyers discuss the matter with Morris, saying they must make the same offer to Thompson to secure his endorsement and his delegates' votes. Morris refuses on principle, as he thoroughly disagrees with Thompson and his policies, and wants a \\"clean\\" campaign without such deals. Late one night when Molly is sleeping, Meyers discovers that Morris is trying to call her after he picks up her phone by mistake. Meyers finds out that Molly and Morris had a brief sexual liaison at a campaign stop in Iowa several weeks previously, and Molly is now pregnant by the Governor, which will cause a scandal. Molly needs 900 for an abortion, but cannot tell her father because their family are Catholics. Meyers helps her with money but warns her not to tell anybody.

Select from: + yes. + it is not possible to tell. + no.","completion":"To evaluate this hypothesis, we will follow these steps: 1. Understand the given premise: \\"Apaches, they are not stupid.\\" 2. Define the keywords in the hypothesis: \\"Apaches are not dumb.\\" 3. Compare the meanings of the keywords and see if they suggest the same idea. 4. Reach a conclusion based on the comparison. Step 1: The premise states that \\"Apaches are not stupid.\\" This implies that Apaches have intelligence and should not be considered as lacking intelligence. Step 2: The hypothesis consists of two keywords - \\"Apaches\\" and \\"not dumb.\\" \\"Apaches\\" refers to the same group of people in both the premise and the hypothesis. \\"Not dumb\\" implies that Apaches are not lacking intelligence. Step 3: Comparing the key expressions in the premise and hypothesis - \\"not stupid\\" and \\"not dumb\\" - Both terms have a similar meaning, indicating a lack of intelligence. By stating \\"not\\" before both expressions, the premise and hypothesis suggest that Apaches have intelligence. Step 4: Based on the comparison in Step 3, since the premise states that Apaches are not stupid, and the hypothesis is about Apaches not being dumb, the meanings of \\"not stupid\\" and \\"not dumb\\" are similar. Therefore, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Apaches are not dumb\\" is true. So the answer is: + yes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who was trying to land on their feet again? Answer the above question based on the context below: Morello and Cornell initially disagreed over the particulars of Cornell quitting the group, with Morello claiming that Cornell did not communicate directly with him about leaving, while Cornell countered: \\"Tom and I did have communications about the fact that I was gonna go make a record, and that I was tired of what ended up seeming like political negotiations toward how we were gonna do Audioslave business and getting nowhere with it.\\" He also added that this process of \\"doing Audioslave business\\" led him to go solo. Cornell has said that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, \\"Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We weren't particularly getting along well, no. Bands work in a way where everyone at some point has to have a similar idea of how you do things...Three albums into it, it started to seem like our interests weren't as conjoined anymore.\\"In 2011, Cornell revealed further information about the band's breakup; \\"Personally a lot of it was me trying to land on my feet again.

Man charged with raping disabled woman, after DNA matched to newborn A California man has been charged with the rape of a mentally-disabled patient at a nursing home last year, after the woman gave birth to a baby whose DNA matched his, police said. FOX40 reports that Marquise Montgomery, 22, was arrested on charges of rape early Thursday in Sacramento and remains jailed on 150,000 bail. Investigators had to wait until the child was born earlier this year to conduct DNA testing to identify the father. Once the results were returned, authorities had to compare them to samples from men who worked at Casa Del Mar Care Facility in Penryn at the time. Montgomery was later identified as a potential suspect, the station reports.

Movie plot title: 9Â½ Weeks Movie plot: The title of the film refers to the duration of a relationship between Wall Street arbitrageur John Gray and divorced SoHo art gallery employee Elizabeth McGraw. John initiates and controls the various experimental sexual practices of this volatile relationship to push Elizabeth's boundaries. In doing so, Elizabeth experiences a gradual downward spiral toward emotional breakdown. Elizabeth first sees John in New York City where she grocery shops and again at a street market where she decides against buying an expensive scarf. John wins her heart when he eventually produces that scarf. They start dating, and Elizabeth is increasingly subjected to John's behavioral peculiarities; he blindfolds Elizabeth, who is at first reluctant to comply with his sexual fantasy demands. Yet she sees him as loving and playful. He gives her an expensive gold watch, and instructs her to use it to think about him at noon. She takes this imperative even further by masturbating at her workplace at the designated time. However, he ultimately confuses Elizabeth by his reluctance to meet her friends despite the intimacy of their sexual relations. Elizabeth's confusion about John increases when he leaves her alone at his apartment. She examines his closet until she discovers a photograph of him with another woman. John asks her if she went through his stuff, declaring that he will punish her. Their ensuing altercation escalates into sexual assault until she blissfully concedes to his struggle to overpower her. Their sexual intensity grows as they start having sex in public places. Elizabeth's heightened need for psychosexual stimulation drives her to stalk John to his office and to obey his injunction to cross-dress herself for a rendezvous.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. run around left thrice after jump left twice A:","completion":"To find the sequence of actions for the given command \\"run around left thrice after jump left twice\\", we can break it down using the given rules: 1. Identify the main parts of the command: \\"jump left twice\\" and \\"run around left thrice\\". 2. For the first part \\"jump left twice\\", we execute 'I_JUMP' and 'I_TURN_LEFT', then repeat it another time. So, the actions are: I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT. 3. For the second part \\"run around left thrice\\", we need to first execute 'I_RUN', then turn around left (i.e., execute 'I_TURN_LEFT' twice) and then repeat the process two more times. So, the actions are: I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT. 4.

Would \\"Other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular, but will appear only once in thousands of years.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"Halley's Comet is next expected to be visible from Earth in 2061. It is a short-period comet, which means it has a relatively short orbital period around the Sun. In the case of Halley's Comet, this period is approximately 75-76 years. Its last appearance was in 1986. Regarding the statement \\"Other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular, but will appear only once in thousands of years,\\" it is only partially accurate. While it is true that other comets can be brighter and more spectacular, their visibility and frequency can vary greatly. Some comets may indeed appear only once in thousands of years, such as long-period comets, which have orbital periods longer than 200 years. However, others are short-period comets, with orbital periods shorter than 200 years, making them more frequent visitors to Earth's vicinity. In summary, Halley's Comet will next appear in 2061, and although other naked-eye comets may be more visually impressive, their frequency and visibility can vary significantly.

Two masked people get out of the truck and walk over to the car. These people turn out to be Krug's younger brother Francis (Aaron Paul) and Krug's girlfriend Sadie (Riki Lindhome). Giles, extremely bloodied, is still alive and so Sadie shoots him in the head. She then frees Krug and kisses him. Krug asks Francis about his son, and he says that he's okay. Morton is also still alive, though badly injured. Krug strangles him with his seatbelt and they all wonder what Morton's thinking about as he's dying.

The mighty fane, with its three massive towers, rises majestically over the red roofs of the town. Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. This is _ in an international treaty called the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by UNESCO in 1972. UNESCO's World Heritage mission is to: encourage countries to sign the World Heritage Convention and to ensure the protection of their natural and cultural heritage; encourage States Parties to the Convention to nominate sites within their national territory for inclusion on the World Heritage List; encourage States Parties to establish management plans and set up reporting systems on the state of conservation of their World Heritage sites; help States Parties safeguard World Heritage properties by providing technical assistance and professional training; provide emergency assistance for World Heritage sites in immediate danger; support States Parties' public awareness-building activities for World Heritage conservation; encourage participation of the local population in the preservation of their cultural and natural heritage; encourage international cooperation in the conservation of our world's cultural and natural heritage.

The first question \\"How do I lose weight without dieting?\\" is asking for guidance on losing weight without having to make significant adjustments or restrictions in one's food choices. This question implies that the person wishes to find alternative methods to weight loss, such as engaging in physical activity, altering lifestyle habits, or possibly considering supplemental options. In this case, losing weight without dieting can involve the following methods: 1. Increasing physical activity: Engaging in regular exercise, such as walking, swimming, or participating in sports, can help burn calories and promote weight loss. 2. Prioritizing sleep: Poor sleep quality can lead to weight gain, so focusing on getting enough restful sleep can contribute to weight loss efforts. 3. Adopting healthier habits: Small changes, like opting for the stairs instead of an elevator or parking further away from a destination, can help improve overall fitness levels. 4. Portion control: Being mindful of portion sizes can make a significant difference in calorie consumption, even if the types of foods consumed don't change dramatically. 5. Drinking more water: Adequate hydration can help with weight loss by improving digestion and maintaining appropriate hunger signals. The second question \\"How do I lose weight through diet only?\\" is specifically requesting advice on how to achieve weight loss solely through adjusting one's diet and food choices. This question suggests that the individual prefers not to rely on exercise or other factors, but to solely focus on their food consumption. To lose weight through diet only, the following changes can be made: 1. Reducing caloric intake: Consuming fewer calories than one's body needs will result in weight loss, as the body will need to use stored fat for energy. 2. Prioritizing nutrient-dense foods: Focusing on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can help maintain overall health while also promoting weight loss. 3. Eliminating processed foods and added sugars: Consuming large amounts of unhealthy, processed foods can lead to weight gain, so cutting them out of your diet can be beneficial. 4. Balancing macronutrient proportions: Adjusting one's diet to include optimal amounts of protein, fat, and carbohydrates can help support weight loss efforts. 5. Practicing mindful eating: Slowing down and consuming food mindfully can help control overeating and lead to weight loss over time. In summary, the questions have different focuses; the first question is about weight loss without necessarily changing the diet, while the second question seeks advice on weight loss through diet adjustments alone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With trembling hands, they prepared to embrace the wooden coffins of sons and daughters, torn away from them too soon, leaving wounds that will never heal. Friends and strangers alike bore witness to these tragedies, stunned in disbelief as tears rolled down their cheeks, blurring the already grey world of grief. In the past several months, a rising wave of violence has led to an alarming surge in the number of young lives lost in Kenya. Despite various efforts by the government and the local populace to restore the sense of security that once prevailed, the disease of lawlessness continues to spread, leaving devastation in its wake. The unsettling silence of a disrupted normalcy echoes through the empty lanes and deserted playgrounds of the country, a haunting reminder of those who were robbed of laughter, of hope, of a future. The Chiromo Mortuary, Kenya’s largest morgue, is the final stop for many of these young victims, where mothers, fathers, relatives, and friends gather to come face-to-face with the catastrophic aftermath. Many of these families arrive carrying the burden of unspoken questions and the longing to see their loved ones for the last time. Often, understanding dawned slowly, as if the mind was reluctant to accept the inevitable truth. The morgue is a microcosm that contains the complete spectrum of human emotions - immeasurable sorrow, intense anger, and frustration with the state of affairs. Among these shadows, however, flickers of love and warmth still persist. Relatives and strangers alike merge together, intertwining fingers, holding one another upright, and illuminating the darkness by lending their shoulders and sharing their tears. While the stark reality of the dark corners of the mortuary reminds these grieving individuals of the brevity of life and the painful certainty of separation, it is the collective support and unity displayed within these walls that demonstrate the strength and resilience of the Kenyan spirit. A shared struggle transcends diverse backgrounds and personal histories, as mankind unites in a common surge of empathy and solidarity. It is within these simple acts of human kindness that hope prevails and resilience finds its roots. The grief that stems from the loss of young lives in Kenya blurs the boundaries of class, race, and ethnicity, reminding us all that the tendrils of tragedy reach without discrimination. The compelling stories of each life lost continue to resonate deeply within hearts and minds both within and beyond Kenya, urging us to call for change and to protect future generations from similar fates. As the weight of the coffins grows heavier and the veil of sorrow thickens at the Chiromo Mortuary, a collective cry for justice rises from trembling lips and tear-filled eyes. The dreams that once danced within the hearts of young Kenyans have been snuffed out in the blink of an eye, and it is in the depths of this sorrow that families, friends, and strangers find a common purpose - to ensure that no more generations of Kenyans are lost to the darkness of violence, and to continue the legacy of love and hope that their departed loved ones once embodied. In the midst of these seemingly endless heartaches, we must strive to remember the warmth and vitality of the young souls that once graced Kenya. For, in the words of Kenyan Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai, \\"In the course of history, there comes a time when humanity is called to shift to a new level of consciousness, to reach a higher moral ground.\\" As the cycle of violence persists, let us ensure that the sacrifices of the sons and daughters of Kenya are not in vain and instead serve as a powerful wakeup call for healing, strength, and change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who ordered warmer water? Hint: Liquid water is a fluid.

Given the background: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] and the situation: Two neighboring lands experienced different climates. In Iceland, the actions of its people lead to a loss of animal and plant species. Denmark tried to keep the environment untouched as they understood its importance and the climate was unaffected. Answer the following question: Which country had a more dramatic influence on the food web? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Iceland had a more dramatic influence on the food web. This is because the actions of its people led to a loss of animal and plant species, which in turn directly impacted the local biodiversity. Biodiversity loss can greatly affect the food web and food chain, as reductions in only one species can have significant consequences for the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services. In contrast, Denmark tried to maintain the environment relatively untouched and keep its climate unaffected. By preserving the environment and biodiversity, Denmark was able to maintain a more stable food web and ecosystem, which in turn provided essential services to support human and environmental well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: For other shrines dedicated to Artemis, see Temple of Artemis (disambiguation) Coordinates: This model of the Temple of Artemis, at Miniatürk Park, Istanbul, Turkey, attempts to recreate the probable appearance of the first temple. The Temple of Artemis or Artemision (Greek: Ἀρτεμίσιον; Turkish: Artemis Tapınağı), also known less precisely as the Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to an ancient, local form of the goddess Artemis. It was located in Ephesus (near the modern town of Selçuk in present-day Turkey). It was completely rebuilt three times, and in its final form was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed.[1] Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site. The earliest version of the temple (a temenos) antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, and dates to the Bronze Age. Callimachus, in his Hymn to Artemis, attributed it to the Amazons. In the 7th century BC, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form, began around 550 BC, under the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. The project was funded by Croesus of Lydia, and took 10 years to complete. This version of the temple was destroyed in 356 BC by Herostratus in an act of arson. The next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in Antipater of Sidon's list of the world's Seven Wonders: Location and history [ edit ] The fame of the Temple of Artemis was known in the Renaissance , as demonstrated in this imagined portrayal of the temple in a 16th-century hand-colored engraving by Martin Heemskerck The Temple of Artemis was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about 75 km south from the modern port city of İzmir, in Turkey. Today the site lies on the edge of the modern town of Selçuk. The sacred site (temenos) at Ephesus was far older than the Artemision itself. Pausanias was certain that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine of Apollo at Didyma.[3] He said that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were Leleges and Lydians. Callimachus, in his Hymn to Artemis attributed the earliest temenos at Ephesus to the Amazons, whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image (bretas) of Artemis, their matron goddess. Pausanias says that Pindar believed the temple's founding Amazons to have been involved with the siege at Athens. Tacitus also believed in the Amazon foundation, however Pausanias believed the temple predated the Amazons.[4] Modern archaeology cannot confirm Callimachus's Amazons, but Pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded. Before World War I, site excavations by David George Hogarth identified three successive temple buildings.[5] Re-excavations in 1987–88[6] confirmed that the site was occupied as early as the Bronze Age, with a sequence of pottery finds that extend forward to Middle Geometric times, when a peripteral temple with a floor of hard-packed clay was constructed in the second half of the 8th century BC.[7] The peripteral temple at Ephesus offers the earliest example of a peripteral type on the coast of Asia Minor, and perhaps the earliest Greek temple surrounded by colonnades anywhere. In the 7th century BC, a flood[8] destroyed the temple, depositing over half a meter of sand and flotsam over the original clay floor. Among the flood debris were the remains of a carved ivory plaque of a griffin and the Tree of Life, apparently North Syrian, and some drilled tear-shaped amber drops of elliptical cross-section. These probably once dressed a wooden effigy (xoanon) of the Lady of Ephesus, which must have been destroyed or recovered from the flood. Bammer notes that though the site was prone to flooding, and raised by silt deposits about two meters between the 8th and 6th centuries, and a further 2.4 m between the sixth and the fourth, its continued use \\"indicates that maintaining the identity of the actual location played an important role in the sacred organization\\".[9] Temple of Artemis and the other Wonders of the Ancient World Timeline and map of theand the other Wonders of the Ancient World Heraclitus deposited his book \\"On Nature\\" as a dedication to Artemis in the great temple. Second phase [ edit ] The new temple was sponsored at least in part by Croesus, who founded Lydia's empire and was overlord of Ephesus,[10] and was designed and constructed from around 550 BC by the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. It was 115 m (377 ft) long and 46 m (151 ft) wide, supposedly the first Greek temple built of marble. Its peripteral columns stood some 13 m (40 ft) high, in double rows that formed a wide ceremonial passage around the cella that housed the goddess's cult image. Thirty-six of these columns were, according to Pliny, decorated by carvings in relief. A new ebony or blackened grapewood cult statue was sculpted by Endoios,[11] and a naiskos to house it was erected east of the open-air altar. A rich foundation deposit from this era yielded more than a thousand items, including what may be the earliest coins made from the silver-gold alloy electrum. Fragments of bas-relief on the lowest drums of the temple, preserved in the British Museum, show that the enriched columns of the later temple, of which a few survive (illustration below) were versions of this earlier feature. Pliny the Elder, seemingly unaware of the ancient continuity of the sacred site, claims that the new temple's architects chose to build it on marshy ground as a precaution against earthquakes. The temple became an important attraction, visited by merchants, kings, and sightseers, many of whom paid homage to Artemis in the form of jewelry and various goods. It also offered sanctuary to those fleeing persecution or punishment, a tradition linked in myth to the Amazons who twice fled there seeking the goddess' protection from punishment, firstly by Dionysus and later, by Heracles. Destruction [ edit ] In 356 BC, the temple was destroyed in a vainglorious act of arson by a man, Herostratus, who set fire to the wooden roof-beams, seeking fame at any cost; thus the term herostratic fame.[12] For this outrage, the Ephesians sentenced the perpetrator to death and forbade anyone from mentioning his name; but Theopompus later noted it.[13] In Greek and Roman historical tradition, the temple's destruction coincided with the birth of Alexander the Great (around 20/21 July 356 BC). Plutarch remarked that Artemis was too preoccupied with Alexander's delivery to save her burning temple.[14] Third phase [ edit ] Alexander offered to pay for the temple's rebuilding; the Ephesians tactfully refused, and eventually rebuilt it after his death, at their own expense. Work started in 323 BC and continued for many years. The third temple was larger than the second; 137 m (450 ft) long by 69 m (225 ft) wide and 18 m (60 ft) high, with more than 127 columns. Athenagoras of Athens names Endoeus, a pupil of Daedalus, as sculptor of Artemis' main cult image.[15] A drum from the base of a column from the 4th-century rebuilding, now in the British Museum Pausanias (c. 2nd century AD) reports another image and altar in the Temple, dedicated to Artemis Protothronia (Artemis \\"of the first seat\\") and a gallery of images above this altar, including an ancient figure of Nyx (the primordial goddess of Night) by the sculptor Rhoecus (6th century BC). Pliny describes images of Amazons, the legendary founders of Ephesus and Ephesian Artemis' original protégés, carved by Scopas. Literary sources describe the temple's adornment by paintings, columns gilded with gold and silver, and religious works of renowned Greek sculptors Polyclitus, Pheidias, Cresilas, and Phradmon.[15] This reconstruction survived for 600 years, and appears multiple times in early Christian accounts of Ephesus. According to the New Testament, the appearance of the first Christian missionary in Ephesus caused locals to fear for the temple's dishonor.[16] The 2nd-century Acts of John includes an apocryphal tale of the temple's destruction: the apostle John prayed publicly in the Temple of Artemis, exorcising its demons and \\"of a sudden the altar of Artemis split in many pieces... and half the temple fell down,\\" instantly converting the Ephesians, who wept, prayed or took flight.[17] Against this, a Roman edict of 162 AD acknowledges the importance of Artemesion, the annual Ephesian festival to Artemis, and officially extends it from a few holy days over March–April to a whole month, \\"one of the largest and most magnificent religious festivals in Ephesus' liturgical calendar\\".[18] In 268 AD, the Temple was destroyed or damaged in a raid by the Goths, an East Germanic tribe;[19] in the time of emperor Gallienus: \\"Respa, Veduc and Thuruar,[20] leaders of the Goths, took ship and sailed across the strait of the Hellespont to Asia. There they laid waste many populous cities and set fire to the renowned temple of Diana at Ephesus,\\" reported Jordanes in Getica.[21] It is, however, unknown to what extent the temple was damaged. Whatever the extent of the injuries to the building, it appears to have been rebuilt or repaired, as the temple is noted to have been in use for worship during the rise of Christianity, and closed as a consequence of the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.[22] However, the history of the temple between 268 and its closure by the Christian persecutions is not well known, and it is unconfirmed how big the damage of 268 was, and exactly which year it was closed by the Christians. Ammonius of Alexandria comments on the closure of the temple in his commentary of the Acts of the Apostles in the mid 5th-century, in which he gives the impression that the closure of the temple had occurred in his living memory.[22] The closure of the Temple of Artemis is assumed to have occurred sometime during the course of the early to mid 5th-century, with the year of 407 as an early date.[22] The closure of the temple was followed by the erasing of the name of Artemis from inscriptions around the city of Ephesus.[22] Final destruction [ edit ] It is unknown how long the building stood after the closure of the temple by the Christians. At least some of the stones from the temple were eventually used in construction of other buildings.[23] Some of the columns in Hagia Sophia originally belonged to the temple of Artemis,[24] and the Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai records the re-use of several statues and other decorative elements from the temple, throughout Constantinople. The main primary sources for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus are Pliny the Elder's Natural History [25], Pomponius Mela i:17, and Plutarch's Life of Alexander [26] (referencing the burning of the Artemiseum). Rediscovery of the temple [ edit ] The site of the temple today. After six years of searching, the site of the temple was rediscovered in 1869 by an expedition led by John Turtle Wood and sponsored by the British Museum. These excavations continued until 1874.[27] A few further fragments of sculpture were found during the 1904–1906 excavations directed by David George Hogarth. The recovered sculptured fragments of the 4th-century rebuilding and a few from the earlier temple, which had been used in the rubble fill for the rebuilding, were assembled and displayed in the \\"Ephesus Room\\" of the British Museum.[28] In addition, the museum has part of possibly the oldest pot-hoard of coins in the world (600 BC) that had been buried in the foundations of the Archaic temple.[29] Today the site of the temple, which lies just outside Selçuk, is marked by a single column constructed of dissociated fragments discovered on the site. Cult and influence [ edit ] The archaic temeton beneath the later temples clearly housed some form of \\"Great Goddess\\" but nothing is known of her cult. The literary accounts that describe it as \\"Amazonian\\" refer to the later founder-myths of Greek emigres who developed the cult and temple of Artemis Ephesia. The wealth and splendor of temple and city were taken as evidence of Artemis Ephesia's power, and were the basis for her local and international prestige: despite the successive traumas of Temple destruction, each rebuilding – a gift and honor to the goddess – brought further prosperity.[30] Large numbers of people came to Ephesus in March and in the beginning of May to attend the main Artemis Procession.[31] Artemis' shrines, temples and festivals (Artemisia) could be found throughout the Greek world, but Ephesian Artemis was unique. The Ephesians considered her theirs, and resented any foreign claims to her protection. Once Persia ousted and replaced their Lydian overlord Croesus, the Ephesians played down his contribution to the Temple's restoration. On the whole, the Persians dealt fairly with Ephesus, but removed some religious artifacts from Artemis' Temple to Sardis and brought Persian priests into her Ephesian cult; this was not forgiven.[32] When Alexander conquered the Persians, his offer to finance the Temple's second rebuilding was politely but firmly refused.[33] Ephesian Artemis lent her city's diplomacy a powerful religious edge. Under Hellenic rule, and later, under Roman rule, the Ephesian Artemisia festival was increasingly promoted as a key element in the pan-Hellenic festival circuit. It was part of a definitively Greek political and cultural identity, essential to the economic life of the region, and an excellent opportunity for young, unmarried Greeks of both sexes to seek out marriage partners. Games, contests and theatrical performances were held in the goddess's name, and Pliny describes her procession as a magnificent crowd-puller; it was shown in one of Apelles' best paintings, which depicted the goddess's image carried through the streets and surrounded by maidens.[34] In the Roman Imperial era, the emperor Commodus lent his name to the festival games, and might have sponsored them.[35] Ephesian Artemis [ edit ] Diana Efesina, Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Italy Traditional many-breasted interpretation in a 16th-century fountain of From the Greek point of view Ephesian Artemis is a distinctive form of their goddess Artemis. In Greek cult and myth, Artemis is the twin of Apollo, a virgin huntress who supplanted the Titan Selene as goddess of the Moon. At Ephesus, a goddess whom the Greeks associated with Artemis was venerated in an archaic, certainly pre-Hellenic cult image[36] that was carved of wood and kept decorated with jewelry. The Lady of Ephesus, 1st century AD, Ephesus Archaeological Museum xoanon An 18th-century engraving of a Roman marble copy of a Greek replica of a lost Geometric period Robert Fleischer identified as decorations of the primitive xoanon the changeable features that since Minucius Felix and Jerome's Christian attacks on pagan popular religion had been read as many breasts or \\"eggs\\"—denoting her fertility (others interpret the objects to represent the testicles of sacrificed bulls that would have been strung on the image, with similar meaning). Most similar to Near-Eastern and Egyptian deities, and least similar to Greek ones, her body and legs are enclosed within a tapering pillar-like term, from which her feet protrude. On the coins minted at Ephesus, the apparently many-breasted goddess wears a mural crown (like a city's walls), an attribute of Cybele as a protector of cities (see polos).[36] On the coins she rests either arm on a staff formed of entwined serpents or of a stack of ouroboroi, the eternal serpent with its tail in its mouth. In some accounts, the Lady of Ephesus was attended by eunuch priests called \\"Megabyzoi\\"; this could have been a proper name or a title. The practise of ritual self-emasculation as qualification to serve a deity is usually identified with Cybele's eunuch mendicant priests, the Galli. The Megabyzoi of Ephesian Artemis were assisted by young, virgin girls (korai).[37][38] The \\"eggs\\" or \\"breasts\\" of the Lady of Ephesus, it now appears, must be the iconographic descendants of the amber gourd-shaped drops, elliptical in cross-section and drilled for hanging, that were rediscovered in the excavations of 1987–1988; they remained in situ where the ancient wooden cult figure of the Lady of Ephesus had been caught by an 8th-century flood (see History above). This form of breast-jewelry, then, had already been developed by the Geometric Period. A hypothesis offered by Gerard Seiterle, that the objects in Classical representations represented bulls' scrotal sacs[39] cannot be maintained.[40][41] A votive inscription mentioned by Florence Mary Bennett,[42] which dates probably from about the 3rd century BC, associates Ephesian Artemis with Crete: \\"To the Healer of diseases, to Apollo, Giver of Light to mortals, Eutyches has set up in votive offering [a statue of] the Cretan Lady of Ephesus, the Light-Bearer.\\" The Greek habits of syncretism assimilated all foreign gods under some form of the Olympian pantheon familiar to them—in interpretatio graeca—and it is clear that at Ephesus, the identification with Artemis that the Ionian settlers made of the \\"Lady of Ephesus\\" was slender. The Christian approach was at variance with the tolerant syncretistic approach of pagans to gods who were not theirs. A Christian inscription at Ephesus[43] suggests why so little remains at the site: Destroying the delusive image of the demon Artemis, Demeas has erected this symbol of Truth, the God that drives away idols, and the Cross of priests, deathless and victorious sign of Christ. The assertion that the Ephesians thought that their cult image had fallen from the sky, though it was a familiar origin-myth at other sites, is only known at Ephesus from Acts 19:35: What man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter? Lynn LiDonnici observes that modern scholars are likely to be more concerned with origins of the Lady of Ephesus and her iconology than her adherents were at any point in time, and are prone to creating a synthetic account of the Lady of Ephesus by drawing together documentation that ranges over more than a millennium in its origins, creating a falsified, unitary picture, as of an unchanging icon.[44] Panorama [ edit ] A 360 degree panoramic view of the site of the temple See also [ edit ] References [ edit ] Works cited [ edit ] Further reading [ edit ] ||||| Sandy Hook. Aurora. Columbine. It's appalling, but one way to achieve fame in America is through acts of infamy. What if that weren't so? Today's media might profit by studying an example from ancient Greece on how to keep evildoers from becoming instant celebrities. The precedent sprang from a heinous crime in 356 BC that occurred in Ephesus, a magnificent city in what is now Turkey. The city's crowning glory was an Ionic temple to the Ephesian version of the Greek goddess Artemis. Then 200 years old, the Artemisium was an exquisite wilderness of columns, art galleries and sculptured altars, acclaimed as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Although the temple, all 45,000 square feet of it, drew many thousands of visitors, one obscure citizen felt no civic pride. After obsessing for years over what the world owed him, this disturbed young man decided to make a name for himself in the darkest way he could devise. One sultry night, he headed to the Artemisium and set it ablaze. We might scoff at the notion of marble structures being destroyed by fire, but Greek temple interiors contained seasoned wood from main beams to floors, along with countless flammable art objects. Because temples were open and staffed night and day, they relied on firewood and olive oil for heat and light. For convenience, combustible materials were stored on site. As the wooden interior of the building and its vast wooden roof burned, the young arsonist exulted, watching the 60-foot marble columns begin to crumble when fiery temperatures rose to as high as 1,000 degrees. Firefighting technology being in its infancy, the blaze continued unchecked, claiming an unknown number of human victims as well. The perpetrator made no attempt to escape. When arrested, he boasted about his infamous act, saying he did it to make his name live forever. Local authorities promptly sentenced the young man and executed him. To keep him from profiting by his crime in the way he most ardently desired — and to discourage imitators — the Ephesians passed a law. It imposed the death penalty on anyone who ever mentioned that criminal by name again. Although the millions of people who lived nearly 2,400 years ago lacked what we would call mass media or instant long-distance communication, they certainly communicated — and faster than you would think. Despite the age-old tendency of humans to gossip, that long-ago name ban had remarkable staying power. With one tacky exception, historians and writers, both Greek and Roman, retold the story for centuries without naming the criminal at its heart. (And you won't catch me mentioning his name either.) Furthermore, the Ephesians rebuilt their glorious temple, which remained a world wonder for an additional 600 years. Marginalized men with murderous plans have been around for millenniums, but we have forgotten how to take away what they most prize, the \\"I'll show 'em\\" notoriety that enables evildoers to win immortality. We have surrendered to shabbier motives, such as selling newspapers or winning TV news ratings. Would such a ban work in today's world, given our hungry media cycles, our insistence on free speech even when it harms? Maybe not. But infamy should not be rewarded with headlines. Or personal recognition. Long-ago cultures — Egyptian, Greek and Roman — also made it a point to censure certain individuals by inflicting a similar punishment. In Latin, it was called damnatio memoriae: to castigate by erasing one's name and deeds from public memory. In our time, damning killers in such a way is surely worth a try.

The temple was completely rebuilt three times, and in its final form, it was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By 401 AD, it had been ruined or destroyed, with only foundations and fragments of the last temple remaining at the site. The earliest version of the temple dates back to the Bronze Age and was attributed to the Amazons. The temple was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about 75 km south of the modern port city of İzmir, in Turkey. The sacred site was occupied as early as the Bronze Age and was constructed in the second half of the 8th century BC. In the 7th century BC, the temple was destroyed by a flood, but it was reconstructed, in more grandiose form, around 550 BC under the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. It was funded by Croesus of Lydia and took 10 years to complete. This version was destroyed in 356 BC by Herostratus in an act of arson. The final and greatest form of the temple was funded by the Ephesians themselves. The Temple of Artemis became an important attraction, visited by merchants, kings, and sightseers. It also offered sanctuary to those fleeing persecution or punishment. The temple was destroyed or damaged in 268 AD in a raid by the Goths. The history of the temple between 268 and its closure by Christian persecutions is not well known. The site of the temple was rediscovered in 1869 by an expedition led by John Turtle Wood and sponsored by the British Museum.

We have this equation: -131 = -21*q + 83 + 227 First, let's add the two numbers (83 and 227) that do not have any q in them. So, we get: -131 = -21*q + 310 Now, we want to get the -21*q all by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we can subtract the 310 from both sides of the equation.

As I prepared to leave my apartment at 6:30 pm, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. This party was a long-awaited reunion of my college friends, and we hadn't seen each other in years. We had all gone our separate ways after graduation, chasing careers and life goals, but tonight was our chance to reconnect and reminisce about the good old days. As I arrived at the party venue, it was obvious everyone else felt the same eagerness to catch up. There were hugs and laughter all around, and the atmosphere was warm and nostalgic. We all dove into conversations, quickly getting absorbed in recounting memories and sharing stories of our lives over the past years. We talked about our successes and challenges, our joys and sorrows, and the people we had met along the way. It was a night filled with emotion as we reconnected with the people who once played such an integral part in our lives. Suddenly, I glanced at my wristwatch and felt a sinking realization: it was already 9:15 pm. There was no way I could catch the 9:30 train - the last train of the night - that would take me home. I was frustrated because I knew that missing the train would mean having to spend a significant amount on a last-minute hotel room. Despite my worries, my friends reassured me that everything would work out. They pointed out that trains often run late, and I should at least give it a shot before resigning myself to staying overnight. Taking their advice, we quickly bid farewell to one another, promising to not let so much time pass before our next reunion. With the map app on my phone guiding me, I raced to the train station, arriving just in time to see that the train was delayed by 15 minutes. Thankful for the extra time, I purchased my ticket and caught my breath as I waited on the platform. As the train pulled into the station, I felt grateful for the unexpected delay and the opportunity it gave me to enjoy the party without having to cut the night short. I found my seat on the train and settled in for the ride home, reflecting on the incredible evening I had spent with my friends. The laughter, the deep conversations, and the joy I experienced tonight would forever be etched in my memory. It made me realize that despite the years that had passed and the distances between us, the bonds we had formed in college remained strong. The delay of the train had worked out in my favor, bringing me not only relief but also clarity: the importance of maintaining connections with the people who had been there during some of the most formative years of my life. As the train made its way through the dark countryside towards my home, I made a silent promise to myself that I would make more of an effort to nurture these friendships in the coming years. After all, life is filled with uncertainties and surprises, much like the unexpected delay of a train. The real treasure in life, as I learned tonight, lies not in perfect planning, but in cherishing the moments we share with one another on this unpredictable journey."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This is because the speaker mentions that they had stripped (most likely referring to removing the old wallpaper) and then had someone else come in to put up the new paper. The speaker then reflects on their experience and expresses that they would do it differently next time - they would let the other person strip and then hang the paper themselves. The statement implies that the speaker seemed to be more satisfied with the other person's ability to hang the wallpaper professionally, and they might have been more efficient or better at the task. Meanwhile, the speaker might have found the stripping process more difficult, time-consuming, or frustrating than expected. Consequently, they believe that allowing the other person to strip the old wallpaper while they hang the new one would make the process more efficient and satisfactory. In conclusion, based on the speaker's reflection and desire to reverse the roles of the task in the future, the hypothesis \\"I did it the wrong way this time because I should've let them strip.\\" can be assumed to be true. The speaker expresses a desire to change their approach, which indicates that their initial method was not optimal for their satisfaction or efficiency in completing the task.

He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the \\"Brotherly Leader\\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, he came to rule according to his own Third International Theory before embracing Pan-Africanism and serving as Chairperson of the African Union from 2009 to 2010. What political philosophy did Gaddifi create?","completion":"Muammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi, commonly referred to as Colonel Gaddafi, was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist who created his own political philosophy known as the Third International Theory. Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, Gaddafi developed the Third International Theory as a unique approach to governance, encapsulating aspects of Arab nationalism, socialism, and direct democracy. The Third International Theory was primarily outlined in Gaddafi's \\"Green Book,\\" which was published in three parts between 1975 and 1981. The Green Book aimed to provide an alternative to both capitalism and communism, and it largely rejected the notion of political parties; instead, it advocated for direct democracy through people's committees and a decentralized political system. Central to the Third International Theory is the belief in self-sufficiency and self-reliance, both on a national and individual level. This includes the decentralization of political power, economic management, and social responsibilities to the masses, thereby empowering the people and reducing the influence of centralized bureaucracy. Furthermore, the Green Book championed social and economic equality. It emphasized the need for equal distribution of wealth and resources, and it urged the abolishment of traditional wage labor systems in favor of individual ownership and cooperatives. In terms of foreign policy and international relations, the Third International Theory strongly advocated for anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, striving to promote a unified Arab and African front in order to resist external influence and domination. In essence, Gaddafi's Third International Theory was an amalgamation of various political ideologies, including elements of Arab nationalism, socialism, direct democracy, and Pan-Africanism. Gaddafi strived to create a unique and self-sufficient political philosophy tailored to the specific needs and aspirations of the Libyan people and the wider Arab and African region. Consequently, his ideas formed the basis for his rule over Libya as the \\"Brotherly Leader\\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 until his fall from power in 2011."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here's the step-by-step justification for this answer: 1. Analyzing the question: The question asks for the worst result of smoking, so we need to consider the severity and impact of each option on an individual's life. 2. Eliminating weaker options: Options like \\"looking cool\\", \\"bad breath\\", and \\"pleasure\\" have either positive or relatively minor negative consequences when compared to the other options.

Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977. - The ZX81 is a home computer produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and was designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful, and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States, where it was initially sold as the ZX-81. Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorised clones of the ZX81 were produced in several countries. - Don Priestley (born 1940) is a video game programmer who wrote for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum between 1982 and 1989. - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory. - The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations. - A game programmer is a software engineer, programmer, or computer scientist who primarily develops codebases for video games or related software, such as game development tools.

In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Objective. Chemotherapeutic agents function by inducing apoptosis and their effectiveness depends on the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in cells. Due to the complicated interactions of the many proteins involved, it has been difficult to determine in tumors whether overexpression of single genes is prognostic for increased resistance. Therefore, we studied the influence of bcl-2 overexpression on resistance to chemotherapeutics in a transgenic mouse system. This allowed us to study a wide variety of cells, including important but rare populations such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).Methods. H2K-bcl-2 transgenic and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with several agents(5-fluoruracil, cyclophosphamide, and busulfan) to determine the contribution of increased amounts of bcl-2 to the response to these chemotherapeutics in vivo. Populations were enumerated using flow cytometry. HSC were studied by FACS purification and long-term reconstitution assays in vivo and resistance was confirmed by short-term proliferation assays with different amounts of chemotherapeutics in vitro. Results. bcl-2 overexpression alone protects many cell types, though protection levels differ between populations and agents. However, even sensitive populations return to pretreatment levels faster in transgenic mice. bcl-2 overexpression also prevents the dramatic changes in HSC following 5-FU treatment (downregulation of c-kit, upregulation of Lin, less efficient long-term reconstitution). In vitro studies directly demonstrate increased resistance of bcl-2 overexpressing HSC to chemotherapeutic agents. Conclusions. Increased expression of bcl-2 in HSC and their progeny endows these cells with broad resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. The ability to (differentially) regulate sensitivity to apoptosis of bystander and tumor cells is clinically important.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In 1975, after ten years of studiowork and artistically successful yet obscure solo records, Fischer found a new direction. Just like Hancock and Chick Corea he was a pioneer on the electric keyboard, and in that capacity he joined vibraphonist Cal Tjader's group. The reunion with Tjader gave a new impulse to Fischer's love of Latin-American music. He started his own group with Latino musicians, \\"Salsa Picante\\", which showed great eclecticism in musical styles. Later he expanded to include four vocalists billed separately as \\"2 + 2\\". The album 2+2 won a Grammy in 1981. After that he recorded And Sometimes Voices and Free Fall with the vocal group. Free Fall was nominated in three categories for the Grammy Awards and won under the category of \\"Best Jazz Album By A Vocal Duo Or Group\\". Crazy Bird was with the instrumental group and Alone Together, a solo piano album recorded on a Hamburg Steinway. It was recorded for Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer and the German company MPS Records. In the seventies, Fischer began doing orchestral sweeteners for R&B groups. His nephew, Andre Fischer, was the drummer of the band Rufus, featuring Chaka Khan. \\"Apparently the arrangements I made for their early records were appreciated, for in the following years I was hired almost exclusively by black artists.\\" Among the artists Fischer worked for are The Jacksons, Earl Klugh, Switch, Debarge, Shotgun (a late 70s offshoot of 24-Carat Black) and Atlantic Starr. His walls are now covered with gold and platinum records from these recordings, Grammy Award Nominations, and several NARAS MVP Awards, culminating in an MVP-emeritus in 1985. Once his fame as an arranger was established, Fischer also worked with pop musicians like Paul McCartney, Prince, Celine Dion and Robert Palmer. \\"I am surprised that my arrangements are now considered one of the prerequisites for a hit album. People feel that they make a song sound almost classical.\\" Classical concert artist Richard Stoltzman commissioned him in 1983 to write a symphonic work using Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn themes. The result, \\"The Duke, Swee'pea and Me\\", an eleven and a half minute orchestral work, was performed with a symphony orchestra and Stoltzman on clarinet all around the world. Answer this question \\"What work did he do with them?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Fischer worked with them as an electric keyboard player, arranger, and composer. He made arrangements for their music and helped create a unique sound for different artists, which contributed to their hit albums."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home. I don’t even know the names of those I’m relegated to living with. The unnerving strangeness and disorientation hat comes with knowing that your life has changed and the culture shock that comes with that is so scary and desensitizes you on that first day. How long did the trip take from the homeless facility to Queens outskirts? - less than an hour - not enough information - 6 hours - 14 hours A:","completion":"The experience you've described certainly paints a vivid picture of the disorientation and uncertainty that can come from being placed in a new living situation, especially as a young individual. The unfamiliarity of the environment, the lack of information about the people you're sharing the home with, and the anxiety of not knowing how to get to and from important places like school would undoubtedly be overwhelming. Based on your description, the trip from the homeless facility at 492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York, to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport, which is around 20 miles away, likely did not take 6 hours or 14 hours - these durations are significantly longer than what would be expected for a 20-mile journey, even in heavy traffic. Instead, it is plausible that the trip took less than an hour or perhaps slightly more, given that traffic in the New York City area can be unpredictable and delays are common. It's important to keep in mind that adjusting to a new home and living situation can take time. It's crucial to find ways to make the space feel more like your own and to build connections with the people you're sharing the home with. Establishing a routine, getting acquainted with the local area, understanding transportation options, and opening communication channels with your foster family are all steps that can help ease the transition. In any case, the first day in a new environment - particularly one as disorienting as you've described - may be challenging, but as time goes on and familiarity grows, it is hoped that a sense of stability and belonging can be established."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Second question: What are the signs in Whatsapp when they blocked and deleted you from their phone book? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: Is there a way to delete WhatsApp's chat history from both yours and your recipient's phones? Answer: Deleting chat history in WhatsApp is only possible on your own device. You have no control over the chat history on your recipient's device or their settings that pertain to the retention of the chat history. However, you can follow these steps to delete chat history on your device: 1. Open the WhatsApp application on your phone. 2. Locate and open the chat conversation you want to delete. 3. Tap on the chat subject (usually the contact name or group name) at the top of the screen to open the chat settings. 4. Scroll down and tap on \\"Clear Chat\\" or \\"Delete Chat.\\" For Android users, tap on the three vertical dots on the upper right corner of the screen, then tap \\"More\\" followed by \\"Clear Chat.\\" 5. Confirm your selection to delete the chat history on your device. It is important to note that deleting the chat history on your device will not affect the chat history on the recipient's device. Second question: What are the signs in Whatsapp when they blocked and deleted you from their phone book? Answer: It can be challenging to confirm if someone has blocked and deleted you from their phone book on WhatsApp. However, there are a few signs that may indicate this: 1. Last Seen status: If you can no longer view the person's WhatsApp \\"last seen\\" status, it could be a sign that they have blocked you. However, this may not always be definitive, as users can change their privacy settings to prevent others from seeing their \\"last seen\\" status. 2. Profile Picture and Status: If the person’s profile picture and status do not update or disappear altogether, it may suggest that they have blocked or deleted you from their contacts. However, this is not definite as the person may have opted to hide their profile picture and status from everyone or only share with specific contacts. 3. Sent messages only having a single tick: When you send a message in WhatsApp, it initially shows one grey tick, which means the message was sent. If the message is delivered, it shows a second grey tick. When the recipient reads the message, both ticks turn blue. If the message only shows a single grey tick and never progresses to the second tick, it may indicate that you have been blocked. However, this may not always be the case as it could be due to network issues or if the person's phone is turned off. 4. Unable to add them to a group chat: If you attempt to add the person to a WhatsApp group chat and receive an error message, it could be a sign that they have blocked you. However, it is important to have a group admin try adding the contact to verify this information. 5. Calling feature not connecting: If you try calling the person via WhatsApp and the call doesn't go through, it could be an indication that you have been blocked. However, this might not be definitive as the person might be on a different call or have connectivity issues. It is essential to understand that these signs are not definitive proof that you have been blocked or deleted from someone's phone book. They may have enabled certain privacy features or could be experiencing network issues, which give the same appearance. Lastly, to answer whether these two questions are asking the same thing: No, they are not. The first question pertains to deleting chat history, while the second question focuses on the signs of being blocked and deleted from someone's phone book in WhatsApp. These are two separate aspects of using the WhatsApp application."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

She discovers an ancient box while water-witching and her Aunt takes it back to their house. Her boyfriend, Gordon (William Reynolds), goes for an archaeologist, arguing the box should be kept intact for appraisal and opening by an expert. However, the Aunt's greedy ranch foreman, anticipating treasure, secretly convinces the slow-witted handyman to break it open. Instead, the box contains the intact head of Gideon Drew (Robin Hughes), a man executed for sorcery 400 years earlier. The head awakens and telepathically takes over the mentally vulnerable handyman. After murdering the foreman, the head has the handyman conceal it while arranging to have a coffin retrieved containing Gideon's body. After the handyman helps the head take control of a young woman (Andra Martin) staying at the ranch, it drives him to approach police in a threatening manner holding the knife that killed the foreman. The police had arrived to investigate the theft of the box's remains and the blood left behind from the killing of the foreman. Failing to stop, the handyman died in a hail of police bullets.

So, ironically, though the guest under control of the head was unable to remove it, Jessica was put in harms way by her protector. Jessica then helps find the head's body, previously being against doing so since they only wished to make money out of it as well as fear that it was an evil business.

The film, based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, was a pioneering achievement in the animation industry and played a significant role in solidifying the reputation of the Walt Disney Studios as a leading producer of animated films. The creation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a massive undertaking for the studio; it took over three years to complete, involved around 750 artists, and cost an estimated 1.5 million at the time, which was a substantial sum for a film budget during the Great Depression. The production was initially referred to as \\"Disney's Folly\\" by industry insiders, as many doubted that a full-length animated feature would succeed. However, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs became an enormous success upon its release, earning critical acclaim and an impressive box-office return. The film's groundbreaking achievements were also recognized with an Honorary Academy Award for Walt Disney, presented as one statuette and seven miniature statuettes, symbolizing the film's story and characters.

Like a lot of doctors, Patrick Kilduff has too many patients and too little time. He and the five other physicians in Shavertown, Pa., oversee the care of about 12,000 people, and a typical office visit lasts just 15 minutes. Because health insurers pay him as little as 45 per visit, Dr. Kilduff and his colleagues say they have little choice but to squeeze as many patients as they can into their day. That makes it virtually impossible to spend time explaining to patients the importance of keeping their blood sugar under control or how to take their medicine. But the insurers’ penny-wise approach can lead to as much as 1 million in hospital bills, if a person with under-treated diabetes has a heart attack. That is why some of the nation’s insurers are now trying to avoid those high medical bills by taking the longer view. They are giving primary care doctors more help — and more money — to take care of the sickest patients and help prevent them from becoming sicker. Otherwise, insurers know they risk being overwhelmed by rising health care costs as an older, sicker population copes with serious chronic conditions. “The essential business model of medical insurance will have to change,” said Dr. Glenn D. Steele Jr., the chief executive of Geisinger Health System, which operates a network of clinics and hospitals in Pennsylvania. Geisinger is known nationally for its innovative approaches to delivering high-quality care at lower cost. It also owns a health insurance plan that covers about 250,000 people — including many of Dr. Kilduff’s patients in Shavertown. As an insurer, Geisinger now pays the salaries of extra nurses in doctors’ offices, whose full-time job is to help patients with chronic diseases stay on top of their conditions and, ideally, out of the hospital. The doctors, including Dr. Kilduff, help hire the nurses, who work closely with the doctors to oversee the patients’ care. The nurses make sure patients who need quick appointments are squeezed in, and they alert the doctors to any early indications of trouble by keeping in close contact with the patients and looking out for the results of patients’ lab tests. One of Dr. Kilduff’s patients, Rose Ann Cox, 69 years old, began working a few years ago with a Geisinger-paid nurse, Karen Thomas, to control her diabetes, talking by phone at least once a week. Ms. Cox had gone to the emergency room when her blood sugars were too low, but she has not been in the hospital for about three years now. “You don’t always think you should call the doctor,” Ms. Cox said. But she has no qualms about reaching out to the nurse. The initiative is part of an overall effort by Geisinger and other insurers to create a so-called medical home — the place where patients’ care is carefully coordinated by a doctor and staff, with particular attention given to the chronically ill. Geisinger began experimenting with this approach three and a half years ago and now uses it in 37 practices, most of which are part of its own network of doctors’ offices. But five of the doctors’ offices, including Dr. Kilduff’s, are independent practices that accept Geisinger as one of several insurance plans. Under the arrangement with the outside doctors, Geisinger pays for the nurses and shares with the doctors any savings they can achieve by reducing medical expenses. So far, Geisinger says it is pleased with the early results. In an unpublished review of 2008 data, Geisinger experienced an 18 percent drop in hospital admissions; overall medical expenses fell 7 percent. Geisinger expects to publish a study on its results later this year. The doctors involved in the Geisinger experiment say they would not hesitate to hospitalize a patient if necessary. Part of the nurses’ work, in fact, is to keep tabs on anyone who is admitted and make sure a treatment plan is in place when a patient is discharged. Many other insurers are also trying new, similar ways of rewarding primary care doctors. “What we’re trying to do is get doctors off the traditional fee-for-service hamster wheel,” said Dr. Gus Manocchia, the chief medical officer for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island, a nonprofit insurer that started a program similar to Geisinger’s earlier this year. “A lot of the Blues plans are at least thinking about this, if they haven’t started it already.” WellPoint, Aetna and Cigna, which are some of the nation’s largest for-profit insurers, are also flirting with the concept. In one case, in Texas, a nurse whose salary is paid by Cigna discovered that a diabetic patient was missing check-ups and not filling his prescriptions because he had lost his job. He was insured through his wife, but without his income the couple could no longer afford to pay his share of the cost of prescriptions or the co-payments for the office visit. The nurse worked with the doctor to find cheaper medicines for the man and arranged for him to pay back his share of the cost of office visits over time. By getting this patient’s diabetes under control, the insurer very likely avoided paying what could have been a 500,000 or 1 million claim to treat a heart attack or start kidney dialysis, said David Toomey, Cigna’s general manager for north Texas, where the insurer is starting to experiment with such programs. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about a health insurer called Geisinger, which is trying to save money by paying doctors more to help take care of very sick patients.

Complete the passage: pick from possible candidates. (CNN) -- Eight years ago, the Democratic presidential candidates had the luxury of running against George W. Bush. Their main foreign-policy message was that they were different from the incumbent: They were against the war in Iraq; against the way Bush was conducting the war on terrorism; against his unilateral approach to world affairs. In 2016, things will be different. The candidates will have to be much more careful about distancing themselves from President Obama's policies. While they will be able to critique him and highlight how they would try do better, they will also face great pressure to outline their own visions for their future.

Bush did. - CNN's war in Iraq: CNN is a news channel and did not start the war in Iraq. - Clinton's war in Iraq: Hillary Clinton did not start the war in Iraq; George W. Bush did. - Democratic's war in Iraq: It was not started by the Democratic Party but by Republican President George W. Bush. - George W. Bush's war...: This is the correct answer. - Iraq's war in Iraq: This option does not make sense, as countries don't start wars against themselves. - Julian Zelizer's war...: Julian Zelizer is an author and a professor, and has no involvement in starting wars. - NATO's war in Iraq: NATO did not start the war in Iraq; George W. Bush did. - Obama's war in Iraq: Barack Obama was not the president when the war in Iraq began; George W. Bush was. - U.N.'s war in Iraq: The United Nations did not start the war in Iraq; George W. Bush did. - U.S.'s war in Iraq: This option might seem correct, but it is less specific than the correct answer, which names the president who started the war. - Zelizer's war in Iraq: This is repeating the wrong option previously mentioned.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Who has more anaerobic bacteria in their garden's soil? Bobby and Ned are two neighbors who both have medium sized gardens in their backyards. They regularly talk to each other about what they are growing and share gardening tips. Bobby is out working in his garden when Ned comes over to chat. Ned mentions that the garden at his house is currently flooded, but he's not sure why since it didn't rain. He asks him if Bobby's garden experienced the same thing. Bobby replies that his garden is not currently flooded. He does mention that he did see Ned's daughter walking around near Ned's garden carrying a hose turned on to full power. Hint: Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, Ned has more anaerobic bacteria in his garden's soil. This is because his garden is currently flooded. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen and become anoxic environments that favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria. On the other hand, Bobby's garden is not flooded, so it is less likely to have a high concentration of anaerobic bacteria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What experience does the author credit with teaching him about knowledge workers?

Parties interested in the estate should go to the Laurel mansion for the reading of the will. Stan can't remember if Ebeneezer is a relative or not but they decide to go to the mansion anyway. They arrive during a thunderstorm and discover that Ebeneezer had been murdered and that the police had placed the notice in the newspaper to draw all of the relatives together to find out who committed the crime. Stan and Ollie are shown to a bedroom to sleep overnight, which is the room in which Ebeneezer was murdered. They hear a strange noise and in the darkness see a pair of eyes which turns out to be a cat. They then hear a scream and decide to investigate. Meanwhile, the butler is calling all of the relatives to a study telling them they have a phone call. After sitting in a chair and lifting the handset of the phone, the lights go out, there is a scream and a sound like a door slamming, and the relative is never seen again.

This is because the number of decomposing organisms correlates with the number of bones left behind for the fossilization process. So, the correct answer would be: B: Less When there are fewer organisms dying, the number of bones available for the decomposition process will be lower. This means that there will be fewer bones left to be scattered by scavengers, wind, and rain. Consequently, the number of bones undergoing fossilization will decrease. As fewer bones are left behind to be buried by sand and soil, there will be a reduced chance of the proteins in those bones being replaced by minerals, leading to fewer newly formed fossils.

Oldman was born in New Cross, London, the son of Leonard Bertram Oldman (1921-1985), a former sailor who also worked as a welder, and Kathleen (nee Cheriton; born 1919). He has stated that Leonard was an alcoholic who left the family when Oldman was seven years old. Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving school at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop. He was a pianist as a child, and later a singer, but gave up his musical aspirations to pursue an acting career after seeing Malcolm McDowell's performance in the 1971 film The Raging Moon. Oldman was charged with drunk driving in 1991 after a night out in Los Angeles with actor Kiefer Sutherland. A deputy city attorney stated that Oldman's blood alcohol content was found to be more than twice California's limit for legal intoxication. Some media outlets reported that Oldman was unhappy with The Contender (2000) because DreamWorks had edited the film to reflect pro-Democratic leanings, stirring controversy. The claims were declared \\"sloppy sensationalism\\" by Oldman's manager, Urbanski, who said that Oldman was \\"the least political person he knew\\", that \\"neither he nor Oldman had made the statements attributed to them,\\" that they had \\"produced the film every last cut and frame,\\" and that \\"DreamWorks did not influence the final cut or have anything to do with it.\\" It has been suggested that Oldman was blacklisted in Hollywood for several years as a result. In an interview in the July/August 2014 issue of Playboy magazine while promoting Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Oldman criticized what he saw as excessive political correctness in American media and the entertainment industry's own discriminating hypocrisy, and argued in support of former controversial celebrities Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin. He stressed that he did not relate with most of their viewpoints, but regarding the former, agreed, \\"Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews\\" (referring to Hollywood). After criticism from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Oldman apologised to them in an open letter. ADL director Abraham Foxman acknowledged that Oldman was remorseful, but felt his letter was insufficient and asked for \\"a little more introspection, a little more understanding and a little more education\\".

Review: There is a scene in Dan in Real Life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first. The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. This is exactly the case for Dan Burns (Steve Carell, the Office) a columnist for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life, yet he comes to realize that things aren't so picture perfect in his own. Dan in Real Life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy, tragedy, and beauty of them all. Besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious. The death of his wife forces Dan to raise his three daughters all on his own... each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life: the first one anxious to try out her drivers license, the middle one well into her teenage angst phase, and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood. Things take a turn for Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore. Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations... which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the Burns Family household. If you've seen Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine, you'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well. Steve Carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life: the frustration and sincere compassion. The family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax. The movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes, yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability: which is an irony within itself.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: What is the first name of the person whose brother is married to an American woman in Los Angeles? Answer the above question based on the context below: Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him. Figuring that this would be the best way to earn the money he needs to get to L.A., Lyon fights in a no-holds-barred bare-knuckle fights to finance the trip. Once in L.A. Lyon goes to the hospital where his brother was taken. He learns that he cannot avenge his brother's murder, as he failed to identify his killers before dying. Grief-stricken, Lyon asks the help of Joshua who tracks down his brother's widow's address. However she refuses to accept any financial aid from him, even though she obviously needs it, because she is angry with Lyon for \\"deserting\\" his brother years ago. She threatens to call the cops and Lyon has no choice but to leave. The answer is:","completion":"Lyon. The person whose brother is married to an American woman in Los Angeles is Lyon Gaultier. He is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion. His brother was the one who was married to the American woman but died after being burned alive during a botched drug deal. Lyon learned about his brother's demise and his wife's situation when he found the letters that the legion had been withholding from him. This led him to desert the legion and make his way to the United States. He had the hope of helping his sister-in-law, who is based in Los Angeles, although she refused his financial assistance because she was upset that Lyon had 'deserted' his brother years before. Regardless, the brother in question who is married to the American woman in Los Angeles is Lyon's brother, hence the person being referred to in the question is Lyon Gaultier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Oil prices eased below 102 a barrel Thursday but remained near highs last seen in 2008 as fighting between rebels and government forces in Libya intensified amid efforts to reach a mediated resolution to the conflict that has cut crude supplies by more than half from the OPEC nation. A gas station attendant pumps gas Wednesday, March 2, 2011, in Portland, Ore. Oil prices rose above 102 a barrel Wednesday as fighting escalated in Libya and petroleum demand grew in the U.S. (AP Photo/Rick... (Associated Press) By early afternoon in Europe, benchmark crude for April delivery was down 80 cents at 101.43 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract added 2.60 to settle Wednesday at 102.23, the highest settlement since Sept. 26, 2008. In London, Brent crude for April delivery was down 88 cents to 115.47 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange. President Hugo Chavez has spoken with Moammar Gadhafi about creating a bloc of friendly countries to help mediate a resolution to Libya's crisis, Venezuela's information minister said Wednesday. Venezuelan officials did not say how Gadhafi had responded to the proposal. On Thursday morning, government warplanes launched an airstrike on Brega, a port town in Libya's rebel-held east, as opposition forces, including mutinous army units, deployed around the city's strategic oil installations. \\"Reports on a peace plan for Libya have put pressure on oil prices,\\" said analysts at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. \\"This dip in is only temporary in our view. It is doubtful that the protesters in Libya will agree to enter negotiations with Gadhafi.\\" The International Energy Agency said Wednesday that a power struggle between supporters and opponents of Gadhafi had cut up to 1 million barrels per day of crude production, more than the group's previous estimate of as much as 750,000 barrels per day. Traders are also factoring in the possibility that political upheaval in other oil-rich countries could pinch global crude supplies. \\"The spread of protests into other major oil producing nations such as Oman, Algeria and especially Saudi Arabia could keep this oil market on a boil for some time to come,\\" Ritterbusch and Associates said in a report. Analysts said sustained oil prices above 100 would eventually undermine consumer demand and threaten global economic growth. With oil prices \\"at these elevated levels, the current global economic recovery is at significant risk of stalling,\\" said Richard Soultanian of NUS Consulting. The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said Thursday that global food prices reached new highs in February _ rising for the eighth consecutive month _ while warning that oil price spikes could provoke further increases. In other Nymex trading in April contracts, heating oil fell 1.08 cents to 3.0469 a gallon and gasoline fell 2.62 cents to 3.0033 a gallon. Natural gas futures were up 1.6 cents at 3.834 per 1,000 cubic feet. ___ Alex Kennedy in Singapore contributed to this report. ||||| Libya's rebel leaders have ruled out any attempt by Hugo Chávez to broker a truce between them and Muammar Gaddafi, whom they insist must leave the country. \\"No one has told us a thing about it and we are not interested anyway,\\" said the spokesman of the national committee in Benghazi, Abdul Hafif Goga. \\"We will never negotiate with him.\\" The rebel leadership said the international community had yet to inform them of any initiative from the Venezuelan president, who reportedly contacted the embattled Libyan leader earlier this week in a bid to enter the fortnight-long violent standoff. \\"Talk of peace is far too late,\\" said a second member of the organising committee, Salwa Bogheiga. \\"A lot of people have died and there is no one to negotiate with. They lost that right when they started killing people on 17 February.\\" The nascent rebel committee in Benghazi and the military leadership that jointly run the eastern side of the country insist that they are now too committed to consider any sort of ceasefire. They say that Gaddafi would use it to re-organise his loyalist troops for a major assault on rebel-held cities. Details of what Chávez proposed to Gaddafi are scant. The Arab League has also been told of the Venezuelan leader's offer but is similarly in the dark about what it entails. In Tripoli, the Libyan government said it accepted the Venezuelan offer. The information minister, Andres Izarra, said the Arab League had shown interest in Chavez's proposal to send an international commission to talk with both sides in Libya. Reports that Chavez's proposal was being taken seriously by Arab leaders has pushed down oil prices. In Benghazi, Khalid Alsahly, a lawyer who is acting as liaison officer between the military and civilian councils, said: \\"The starting point of our revolution is peaceful resistance, and we were peaceful until Gaddafi's people started using guns and fire on us. \\"Now we are training and, yes, we will march to Tripoli if necessary. We have a very great number of young men who are being trained, and we have the resolve. \\"They are full of desire to change the Gaddafi regime and we will march on Tripoli because we have the will to fight, and his people do not. We will move when we are ready.\\" |||||","completion":"The article talks about oil prices going a little below 102 per barrel because of the ongoing fighting in Libya. The fighting affects how much oil is produced and supplied from the country. The president of Venezuela wants to help solve the problem in Libya, but the people fighting against the Libyan leader might not want to negotiate. High oil prices can make it hard for the world economy to grow and can even increase the prices of food. People are also worried that if similar problems happen in other oil-rich countries, it might affect the oil supply globally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The statement discusses the transition from the Pickelhaube to the Stahlhelm during World War I, which is not relevant to determining the size of a World War 2 helmet. To determine the size needed for a German World War 2 helmet, you should follow these steps: 1. Measure your head: Use a flexible measuring tape to measure the circumference of your head. Place the tape just above your eyebrows and ears, roughly 1 inch (2.54 cm) above, to ensure it covers the widest part of your head. Record the measurement in centimeters. 2. Consult a sizing chart: Many reproductions of German World War 2 helmets will provide a sizing chart (often called \\"liner size chart\\") that matches head circumference measurements to helmet sizes. These sizes typically range from 54, 55,... up to 66, 67, etc. Some may include a 'shell size' which dictates the overall external size or weight of the helmet; these sizes are typically represented by letters like \\"EF\\" or \\"Q.\\" Refer to the chart to find the size that corresponds to your measurement. Sizes may vary slightly between manufacturers, so always consult the chart provided for the specific helmet you are considering. 3. Try on the helmet (if possible): Whenever possible, try on the helmet to ensure a proper fit. Your forehead should be covered, but the helmet should not rest too low on your brow, obstructing your vision. There should be no pressure points, and the liner should provide a snug, even fit around your head. If a helmet is not available to try on, use the sizing chart as your primary guide. 4. Adjust the liner if needed: Many original and reproduction German World War 2 helmets have adjustable liners. If your helmet feels too tight or too loose, you may be able to adjust the liner straps for a better fit. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions to make these adjustments safely. By following these steps, you should be able to find the appropriate size for a German World War 2 helmet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Orange farm didn't grow cover crops. But I can use this background: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.

During the 11th century, the counts of Barcelona and other Catalan nobles started to push their frontiers towards the south, against the Muslim territories, gradually gaining control over the lands up to the Ebro River. The capture of important cities such as Tarragona, Lleida, and Tortosa in the late 11th and early 12th centuries contributed significantly to the consolidation of Catalan power in the region. This territorial expansion continued through the 12th century as Catalan rulers extended and consolidated their control in areas north of the Ebro River, effectively establishing their sovereignty in the region. By the end of the 12th century, the County of Barcelona had effectively evolved into the Principality of Catalonia, which, together with the Kingdom of Aragon, formed the Crown of Aragon, setting the stage for further expansions in the 13th century. In the 13th century, the Crown of Aragon, under King James I, continued its expansionist policies by conquering the Kingdom of Valencia and the Balearic Islands. As a result, the Crown of Aragon emerged as a significant power in the Mediterranean, with influential territories in modern-day Spain, France, and Italy. In conclusion, the statement in question correctly answers the query about the period when the Catalan rulers expanded their territory to the north of the Ebro River. This expansion took place during the 11th and 12th centuries as a part of the larger Reconquista movement."},{"prompt":"Q:Information: - The Italian Army (Italian: Esercito Italiano; EI) is the land defence force of the Italian Armed Forces of the Italian Republic.

These seed tubers can be held back from your own crop or purchased at a garden store.","completion":"Alright, kiddo, let me explain what you need to do to grow oca plants. 1. Sprout the tubers: First, you need tiny baby plants called \\"sprouts\\" to grow from the oca tubers. To do this, place your tubers in a bright spot, but not in direct sunlight. After a few weeks, little sprouts will pop out! 2. Prepare the soil: While waiting for the tubers to sprout, get your garden ready. Oca plants like soft, fluffy soil so they can stretch out as they grow. Ask a grown-up to help you mix compost or aged manure into your garden's soil. This will give the oca plants yummy food to eat while they're growing. 3. Plant the sprouted tubers: When the sprouts are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, it's time to plant them. Ask your grown-up to help you dig little holes about 4 inches (10 cm) deep and at least 3 feet (1 m) apart. Gently place a sprouted tuber in each hole, with the sprout pointing upwards. Then cover them up with soil. 4. Water and care: Oca plants need water to grow big and strong! Make sure you water them gently, keeping the soil moist but not too wet. Ask your grown-up to help you remove any weeds so your oca plants have room to grow. 5. Harvest: In about 6 months, the oca plants will be ready to harvest! That's when you can dig up the tubers. Be gentle because they can break easily. You can eat them, share with friends, or save some for planting next year! And that's how you grow oca, little buddy!

A friend asked me to answer this question: What financial institute did the man who owned Chartwell suffer heavy losses investing in?, using the article: In the opinion of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust and author of the Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became \\"the most important country house in Europe\\". A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own \\"little Foreign Office ... the hub of resistance\\". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, \\"I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament\\". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confident of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, \\"there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late\\".Churchill also recorded visits to Chartwell by two more of his most important suppliers of confidential governmental information, Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram, information which he used to \\"form and fortify my opinion about the Hitler Movement\\". Chartwell was also the scene of more direct attempts to prepare Britain for the coming conflict; in October 1939, when reappointed First Lord of the Admiralty on the outbreak of war, Churchill suggested an improvement for anti-aircraft shells; \\"Such shells could be filled with zinc ethyl which catches fire spontaneously ...

While the specific financial institution in which he suffered heavy losses is not directly mentioned in the provided article, it's important to note that during this time period, the global economy experienced significant turmoil, starting with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 in the United States. As a result of the Great Depression, many banks and financial institutions faced collapse or heavy losses, directly impacting investors like Churchill.

The problem statement is asking us to find the perimeter of a rectangular room, given the increase and decrease in the area when the dimensions are modified. We have: - Length of the room: L - Breadth of the room: B - Increased length: L + 1 - Increased breadth: B + 1 - Decreased breadth: B - 1 Step 2: Set up the equations based on the given information. We are given two situations: 1. When both length and breadth are increased by 1 meter, the area is increased by 21 sq. meters. 2. When the length is increased by 1 meter and the breadth is decreased by 1 meter, the area is decreased by 5 sq. meters. Let's set up two equations using these conditions: Equation 1: (L + 1)(B + 1) = LB + 21 Equation 2: (L + 1)(B - 1) = LB - 5 Step 3: Simplify and solve the equations for L and B. Now, we'll expand and simplify the two equations: Equation 1: LB + L + B + 1 = LB + 21 Equation 2: LB - L + B - 1 = LB - 5 Simplify the equations by removing the common term LB: Equation 1: L + B + 1 = 21 Equation 2: - L + B - 1 = -5 Now, add Equation 1 and Equation 2: 2B = 16 Now, we can find B by dividing both sides by 2: B = 8 Now that we have the value of B, we can substitute it into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find L. Let's use Equation 1: L + 8 + 1 = 21 L = 21 - 8 - 1 L = 12 Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular room. Now that we have the length and breadth of the room, we can find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Breadth) Perimeter = 2 * (12 + 8) Perimeter = 2 * 20 Perimeter = 40 meters Output: The perimeter of the rectangular floor is 40 meters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

Question 1: It is very challenging to encompass SNMP in a active measurement platform. Why? Can you also give me reference in literature that proves why? Question 2: Why do you think syndicating content is important? Also share a few platforms that you follow. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They address two separate topics. I will provide detailed answers for both questions. Question 1: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a standard protocol used to exchange information between network devices, allowing administrators to monitor and manage these devices. Integrating SNMP into an active measurement platform can be challenging for several reasons: 1. Scope and Complexity: SNMP is a complex protocol that covers various aspects of network management, from device configuration to performance metrics. In an active measurement platform, multiple protocols and tools need to be assimilated to efficiently monitor different types of network devices and their underlying metrics. SNMP's complexity may pose a challenge in such integration. 2. Protocol Variations: SNMP comes in several versions, such as SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3, each with its own specifications and features. Implementing SNMP support in an active measurement platform requires accommodating these variations, which can be challenging. 3. Security Issues: SNMP, especially in its earlier versions, has notable security vulnerabilities, including weak authentication and authorization mechanisms. Incorporating SNMP into an active measurement platform requires addressing these security concerns to protect the monitored devices and the collected data. 4. Scalability: Network monitoring platforms often need to support a large number of devices and frequent monitoring intervals. SNMP's polling-based approach may lead to congestion and inefficient consumption of network resources in large-scale deployments. A reference in literature that elaborates on the challenges of integrating SNMP into an active measurement platform is \\"SNMP at the edge: taking the challenges\\" by Mark Burgess (2002), which can be found here: https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/lisa02/tech/Burgess.pdf. Question 2: Syndicating content is important for several reasons: 1. Increased Exposure: Content syndication allows your content to reach a wider audience, extending its reach beyond your website or social media channels. This increased exposure ultimately leads to higher traffic and greater visibility for your brand. 2. SEO Benefits: Syndicating content on reputable platforms can contribute to improved search engine rankings. These platforms create credible backlinks to your original content, signaling search engines that your content is valuable and trustworthy. 3. Establishing Authority: Building relationships with reputable content syndication platforms showcases your content alongside other established industry leaders. This association improves your credibility and authority in your field. 4. Time and Resource Efficiency: Creating quality content requires significant time and resources. By syndicating your content, you can make better use of your existing content and increase its impact without having to create more new material. A few popular content syndication platforms include: 1. Medium (https://medium.com/): A blogging platform that allows you to republish content, reaching a wider audience. 2. Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/): A social networking and discussion forum where you can share links to your content. 3. Business2Community (https://www.business2community.com/): A platform for industry professionals to contribute their expertise and knowledge through articles and blog posts. 4. Outbrain (https://www.outbrain.com/): A content promotion platform that displays your content as \\"recommended\\" articles on other websites, driving traffic back to your site.

That's why it's so disturbing how much heat European currency and sovereign debt speculators are getting these days. Even the U.S. has climbed aboard the bandwagon now. Reports of a U.S. Justice Department investigation into Soros Fund Management, SAC, and Greenlight Capital short positions against the euro broke last week. Yet now the speculator clamp down is evolving into something completely terrifying. Apparently, it could now be considered collusion if you simply share economic opinions over dinner: WSJ: The Journal article disclosed that the big euro bets were emerging amid gatherings including an \\"idea dinner\\" involving a number of hedge funds including SAC, Greenlight and Soros, where a trader argued that the euro is likely to fall to \\"parity,\\" or equal to, against the dollar on an exchange basis. The euro currently trades at 1.3609. One of the questions investigators are likely to examine is whether such information-sharing constitutes collusion, the people say. ... At one such gathering, a dinner on Feb. 8 at a Manhattan restaurant, an SAC portfolio manager said he believed the euro could fall to a level equal to that of the dollar and urged other traders to \\"short,\\" or bet against, the euro as his firm had, according to people at the dinner. The size of the bets against the euro is unclear. In a research note issued to hundreds of hedge-fund clients shortly after the dinner, the research boutique that hosted the event summed up the SAC manager's argument without mentioning his name. [But attributing it to an unnamed third party source, 'a presenter', which is standard practice] One of the most dangerous misconceptions used to restrict economic freedoms is that opinions have more weight than fundamentals. Should we arrest people for threatening 'economic stability' if they argue against a particular stimulus bill or government and then collectively vote against it? Because that's all euro-shorts are doing. Whoever thinks that euro speculators are pushing the euro to unfairly low levels has an opportunity to vote against them any day of the week in the currency markets. So let's not forget that a truly viable currency can carry the weight of open criticism, just like a strong nation or value-system can. Else traders better brush up on their Orwellian double speak. See the latest EUR-USD movements here. ||||| The Justice Department has launched an investigation into whether hedge funds might have banded together to drive down the value of the euro, people familiar with the matter say. In a letter last week, the department has asked hedge funds including SAC Capital Advisors LP, Greenlight Capital Inc., Soros Fund Management LLC and Paulson & Co. to retain trading records and emails relating to the euro, say people who have seen the letter.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The origins of blues are not unlike the origins of life. For many years it was recorded only by memory, and relayed only live, and in person. The blues were born in the North Mississippi Delta following the Civil War. Influenced by African roots, field hollers , ballads, church music and rhythmic dance tunes called jump-ups evolved into a music for a singer who would engage in call-and-response with his guitar. He would sing a line, and the guitar would answer. From the crossroads of Highways 61 and 49, and the platform of the Clarksdale Railway Station, the blues headed north to Beale Street in Memphis. The blues have strongly influenced almost all popular music including jazz, country, and rock and roll and continue to help shape music worldwide. Bad luck and trouble are always present in the Blues. Relentless rhythms repeat the chants of sorrow, and the pity of a lost soul many times over. The blues form was first popularized about 1911-14 by the black composer W.C. Handy. However, the poetic and musical form of the blues first crystallized around 1910 and gained popularity through the publication of Handy's Memphis Blues(1912) and St.Louis Blues(1914). Instrumental blues had been recorded as early as 1913. During the twenties, the blues became a national craze. Mamie Smith recorded the first vocal blues song, Crazy Blues in 1920. In the early 1960s, the urban bluesmen were \\"discovered\\" by young white American and European musicians. Many blues-based bands brought the blues to young white audiences. Since the sixties, rock has undergone several blues revivals. Some rock guitarists have used the blues as a foundation for offshoot styles. The latest generation of blues players like Robert Cray and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, gracing the blues tradition with their incredible technicality , have drawn a new generation listeners to the blues.

Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which of the following people has a book of the Bible named after them: Mary, Luke or Jesus?\\" is in \\"Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \\"purification\\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \\"purification\\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \\"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \\"prepurified\\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \\"Conception of St. Ann [i.e., of the Theotokos in her womb]\\" was becoming popular. After this period, the \\"purification\\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius).\\".

In order to support or refute the hypothesis, additional information about the program managers' work patterns, work distribution, and responsibilities would be necessary. For instance, we would need to know if program managers typically have simultaneous involvement in different projects, or if their projects are usually exclusive, meaning that they committed themselves to just one project at a time. As a summation, based on the available information in the premise, we cannot conclude whether the hypothesis \\"All program managers worked on multiple projects at all times\\" is true or not.

Article:","completion":"Title: Tragic Accident on Set of 'The Walking Dead' Claims Life of Stuntman John Bernecker The entertainment industry is mourning the loss of talented stuntman John Bernecker, who sadly passed away after a devastating fall on the set of the hit TV show, 'The Walking Dead.' The accident, which occurred during the filming of season 8, has shaken the show's cast and crew, as well as the wider community of actors and professionals working in the world of television and film. John Bernecker, 33, was described as a cherished and highly skilled member of the show's production team. He was an experienced stunt performer and coordinator, who had amassed an impressive body of work over the course of his career. His credits include popular films such as 'Get Out,' 'Logan,' 'Black Panther,' and 'The Fate of the Furious,' as well as numerous television series, including 'The Vampire Diaries,' 'Scream Queens,' and 'Into the Badlands,' among others. Bernecker's untimely passing has left a void in the stunt community, with many colleagues sharing their heartfelt condolences and tributes in his memory. The tragic accident occurred on July 12, 2017, when Bernecker was performing a stunt that involved a 22-foot fall from a balcony. It was reported that he missed the safety cushion by just a few inches, sustaining severe head injuries from impact with the concrete floor. Despite being rushed to Atlanta Medical Centre, he succumbed to his injuries the following day, leaving behind an industry in shock. After news of the accident broke, production of the eighth season was halted temporarily to allow for an investigation into the incident. As a result, the show's producers, Stalwart Films, were cited by the US Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) with a \\"serious\\" violation and fined 12,675. This fine amounts to the maximum penalty that can be imposed by the agency for a single violation. OSHA found that the company's failure to provide adequate protection to Bernecker during the stunt amounted to the violation of workplace safety requirements, which ultimately led to his death. The accident on the set of 'The Walking Dead' sparked urgent discussions about safety measures within the entertainment industry, particularly in relation to stunt performers. While many professionals in the field have expressed the need for constant vigilance in ensuring a safe work environment and minimizing risks, the unpredictable nature of stunt work means that occasional accidents still occur. The show, its cast, and the entire industry have been forced to confront the stark reality and potential dangers that stunt performers face in their line of work. In memory of John Bernecker, both the cast and crew of 'The Walking Dead' dedicated the season 8 premiere to his lasting legacy. A heartfelt message that accompanied the episode read, \\"In loving memory of our friend and colleague John Bernecker, who shared his passion for storytelling with all of us. He will be greatly missed.\\" Bernecker's passing has underscored the vital importance of upholding stringent safety standards within the entertainment industry, as well as acknowledging and honoring the immense contributions of stunt performers and coordinators around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The perfect plan. It all goes wrong. They're in trouble. The police are outside. They're cornered. What are they gonna do now? Sound familiar? The movie seems like it's trying to be a combination of the acting workshop, the \\"indie\\" film and the theater. It's the kind of things that actors love--it's kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting... acting angry, tense, scared, conversing, scheming, planning--giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up. A trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, one brother, come up with a big heist scheme... and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works. To top things off, there's a bit of a \\"fender-bender\\" and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield. The cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically (and leadenly) \\"Dino's Last Chance.\\" Spacey, as a director, tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and delivery of dialouge. He pans over to a bright passion-red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he keeps all the violence off-screen, really. I think that was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge. The problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role. Matt Dillon (\\"Drugstore Cowboy\\" and \\"Wild Things\\") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. Gary Sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag-along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul-swearing mad-dog police lieutenant who's all thumbs, but he isn't given anything to really do here. William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood. And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this. Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going. The characters are mostly chatting away, trying to think of a plan... and they're to calm and too articulate. There's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside, ready to strike. At one point, one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar. Oh brother. Oh bother. These cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up. Shouldn't the holed-up crooks be a little scared, a little uneasy? Meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside. Someone whips out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation off-screen and there's one more casualty that happens that's... well, kinda sad. But... Faye Dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving on her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part. A cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look. And so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield. The dialouge is obviously trying to go for a David Mamet approach and it's as profane, but never as realistic or as insightful. The movie feels like too much of what it really is... a really low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's \\"not bad, but needs a few more re-writes.\\" Spacey shows he's not a terrible director, but he lacks a sort of feel for \\"shaping a movie\\" and it feels like he's just filming actors act. These actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the movie really suffers from miscasting. I don't mean that the wrong actors were cast. I think they found just the right cast, but placed them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely. Having veteran mob actor Joe Mantagna play the leader of the pack, Gary Sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops, keeping Fischter in his \\"bloodthirsty goon\\" part and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb. That would have been a big improvement. When some actors direct, it works. They can even win Oscars for it. But a lot of the time, when actors direct, they have a tendency to just focus on the performances. Just shoot the actors acting. Sometimes it works... but they need a good showcase for it. An excuse for it. Hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming-of-age stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point A to point B as well. There are a few really great entries into this genre.'

You might even need to leave your home right away. So you are supposed to plan for the bad situations before the disaster comes. Here are some suggestions: First, have a family meeting. Plan a way to get your family members together if they can't find each other after the disaster. Choose two places for everyone to go to if it isn't safe to return home. The first should be near your house. You can go there in an emergency like a fire. The second meeting place should be outside your neighborhood. Next, choose a person outside your area who can help your family get in touch with each other. After a disaster, it is often easier to communicate over a long-distance call than a local one. The person can pass messages between your family members. Then, get a family disaster _ ready. It should include things your family needs. It can help you survive at least for three days like bread, water, medicine and things like that. Put them in a bag so you can carry it if you leave in a hurry. When doing it, remember that different people have different needs. Include special things necessary for elderly or young members of your family. Finally, practice your emergency plan, and update it as necessary. You may not be able to stop disasters, but with a little planning you can be helped.

Write an article based on this summary: Authorities in California have lifted an evacuation order for some 180,000 people who live below the highest dam in the US, as fear of spillage receded.","completion":"Title: California's Highest Dam Avoids Crisis: Evacuation Order Lifted for 180,000 Residents Introduction California authorities have recently lifted an evacuation order for approximately 180,000 people residing below the highest dam in the United States. The situation, which caused widespread concern due to the fear of spillage, has now been deemed under control, prompting residents to return to their homes. (Step 1: Begin the article with an introduction that highlights the main points to be discussed) The Oroville Dam Crisis The Oroville Dam, located in Northern California, is the tallest dam in the United States, standing at a staggering height of 770 feet. The dam forms an essential part of the California State Water Project and plays a critical role in managing the state's water supply system. In recent weeks, heavy rainfall had caused a rapid increase in the dam's reservoir levels, sparking concerns over potential leakage or spillage, which prompted authorities to order the evacuation of nearly 180,000 people. (Step 2: Provide background information on the location and importance of the dam, and explain the crisis) Efforts to Mitigate Dam Leak Risk In response to the alarming situation, authorities and emergency workers implemented several measures to mitigate the risk of spillage and alleviate pressure on the dam. These measures included the use of helicopters to drop bags of rocks on erosion-prone areas and the release of water through the dam's primary spillway. (Step 3: Discuss the efforts made by authorities to address the situation) Lifting of the Evacuation Order After careful monitoring of the situation and extensive work to repair and strengthen the dam, authorities determined that the imminent threat had been sufficiently mitigated, allowing them to lift the evacuation order for the affected residents. (Step 4: Explain the indicators that led the authorities to lift the evacuation order) Lessons Learned and Future Precautions The Oroville Dam crisis highlights the importance of proactive maintenance and investment in dam infrastructure, particularly as extreme weather events become more frequent due to climate change. Lessons learned from this situation will undoubtedly guide future policies on dam safety and emergency preparedness, ultimately working to protect the millions of people living in close proximity to dams all over the country. (Step 5: Conclude the article by discussing the lessons learned and the need for future precautions) Conclusion In summary, the evacuation order for 180,000 people living below the US's highest dam has now been lifted, thanks to the tireless efforts of authorities who managed to successfully mitigate the risk of spillage. Although the situation has been resolved, it reminds us of the importance of proper dam maintenance and planning to prevent similar crises in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Doug Madsen (Tim Allen), Woody Stevens (John Travolta), Bobby Davis (Martin Lawrence), and Dudley Frank (William H. Macy) are four middle-aged suburban men living in a Cincinnati area suburb who find themselves frustrated with the pace of daily life and lack of adventure. Doug is a dentist who has trouble relating to his son Billy (Dominic Janes), Dudley is a single clumsy computer programmer who is afraid to talk to women. Bobby is a henpecked plumber whose wife has made him return to work after having taken a year off to unsuccessfully write a book, and Woody is a rich lawyer married to a supermodel. They find escape from their daily routines on weekends by riding motorcycles together posing as a biker gang called the \\"Wild Hogs\\". One day, when Woody finds out his wife is divorcing him and leaving him bankrupt, he and his friends go on a road trip on their bikes to California. After encountering several misadventures, they end up at a local bar, where they meet a much larger biker gang called the Del Fuegos, headed by Jack Blade (Ray Liotta). Jack calls the Wild Hogs \\"posers\\" and has his gang take Dudley's bike after a bogus deal to exchange Dudley's bike for a new bike that is in fact old and derelict, forcing the men to leave with Dudley in a sidecar attached to Woody's bike. Outraged at their actions, Woody returns to the Del Fuegos bar and retrieves Dudley's bike, cuts off their bikes' fuel supplies in the process and fabricates a story to the other Wild Hogs of how he \\"negotiated\\" with them to return the bike. When the Del Fuegos hear the Wild Hogs riding back past the bar, they attempt to pursue them, only for the bikes to stall. Jack inadvertently drops his lit cigarette onto the ground, igniting the fuel leaking from the bikes which then causes the the bar to explode. Woody, after witnessing the explosion from afar, convinces the others to keep riding.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of the daughter of the man who premiered a stream of \\"desk drawer\\" works in 1953? , can you please find it? Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance...

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -20*p - 42 = -75*p + 62*p for p.","completion":"To solve the equation -20*p - 42 = -75*p + 62*p for p, we should follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the right side of the equation, we have terms -75*p and 62*p, which we can combine. -75*p + 62*p = -13*p So the equation becomes: -20*p - 42 = -13*p Step 2: Move the terms containing p to one side of the equation and the constant terms to the other side. To do this, we will add 13*p to both sides of the equation to move the p terms to the left side. -20*p + 13*p - 42 = -13*p + 13*p -7*p - 42 = 0 Now, we will add 42 to both sides to move the constant term to the right side. -7*p - 42 + 42 = 0 + 42 -7*p = 42 Step 3: Solve for p. To find the value of p, we need to isolate p. We will do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -7. -7*p / -7 = 42 / -7 p = -6 So, the solution to the equation -20*p - 42 = -75*p + 62*p is p = -6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Keaton's comedies are _innerly, harmoniously, intelligently ordered, thought. Wonderfully amusing, deliberately delightful and inventive, THREE AGES should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if I were to sketch one. A threefold love story will enchant the viewers; I want to bring here this approachKeaton's comedy is like Lang's DESTINY upsidedownor À REBOURS. Again a couple traverses the waters of timeand of epochsin the Stone Age, in Rome and in Keaton's timesin a Mohammedan country, in Renaissance Italy and in China. The same device works in the both moviesone, a grim, eerie melodrama; --the other, a light, virtuouslypaced comedy. At Keaton it's essentially the same couple; and maybe the same is with Lang. The babe desired by both Buster and Beery is nice. I have found THREE AGES well written and smart, without being ostentatiously sophisticated; the plot is basically very POPEYElikethe babe is a piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the two male rivalsKeaton and Beery. Keaton's movie is simply enormously likable, and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious funyet it's not, but it is grand fun, large fun, ample fun. And Wallace Beery makes a fine nemesis. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review thought positively of the movie.

After the buyer returned the shoes they purchased, Quinn paid the buyer back. Given the context: Why did Quinn pay them back? Possible answers: keep the money for the news, make the buyer angry, refund the money for the shoes","completion":"Given the context, Quinn paid the buyer back to refund the money for the shoes. When a buyer returns a purchased product, it is customary and expected for the seller to provide a refund. This process ensures customer satisfaction and maintains the reputation of the seller. In this scenario, Quinn is adhering to standard business practices by returning the buyer's payment for the shoes upon receiving the returned product. There can be a variety of reasons why a buyer returns a product, such as dissatisfaction with the product's quality, the product not meeting their expectations, or the product not fitting properly (as in the case of shoes). By refunding the buyer when they return the product, Quinn demonstrates a commitment to provide a satisfactory shopping experience, acknowledges the buyer's concerns, and shows a willingness to address any issues arising from the purchase. Issue resolution through refunds is a key aspect of maintaining good customer relations. This approach enables sellers to build trust with their customers, which in turn can lead to repeat business, positive reviews, and word-of-mouth recommendations. On the other hand, if Quinn were to keep the money for the returned shoes or make the buyer angry by not providing a refund, this could have a negative impact on their reputation, deter potential buyers, and lead to business losses in the long run. In summary, Quinn paid the buyer back to refund the money for the shoes after the buyer returned their purchase. This action is in line with standard business practices, ensures customer satisfaction, and helps maintain the seller's reputation. By providing refunds upon receiving returns, businesses like Quinn's demonstrate their commitment to addressing buyer concerns and maintaining a positive shopping experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One missile landed in an uninhabited area while at least one more is thought to have landed in the sea off the city. Meanwhile, Israel's defence minister has authorised the call-up of 30,000 reservists. The BBC's Richard Galpin, in Jerusalem, says speculation is mounting that the Israeli army is preparing to launch a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip. Eighteen Palestinians have been killed in Israeli operations against militants in Gaza since Wednesday afternoon, when an Israeli air strike killed the military leader of Hamas, the militant group that controls the territory, in his car in Gaza City. Three Israelis have died during a barrage of hundreds of missiles fired from Gaza, mostly into southern Israel, some of which have been intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system. The rocket fired at Tel Aviv that came down on dry land hit a field in the suburb of Rishon Lezion, south of the city. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad said it had fired an Iranian-built, Fajr-5 rocket at Tel Aviv. By Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The danger of the kind of operation Israel has started is that rising casualties on both sides cause a violent escalation that neither side can control. If that happens it could cause a much bigger crisis across the Middle East. By Wyre DaviesBBC News, Gaza The overwhelming mood in Gaza is sombre but vengeful. Sombre because few here want another war with Israel - another war in which civilians would undoubtedly suffer as much as the fighters. By Yolande KnellBBC News, Kiryat Malachi There is a gaping hole on the top floor of an old four-storey apartment building where two Israeli families were living. A resident Yerumichael Simon told me: \\"I live across the street and I used to live inside that building.\\" BBC reporters on Israel-Gaza violence \\"We have widened the range of the battle to reach Tel Aviv and what is coming will be greater,\\" the group said in a statement. This is the first time Tel Aviv has been threatened by missiles since the first Gulf War, when missiles fired by Saddam Hussein's Iraq landed in the city. Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said: \\"This escalation will exact a price that the other side will have to pay.\\" The Hamas Prime Minister in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, condemned what he called Israel's \\"ferocious assault\\" against the territory. \\"We here in Gaza will remain steadfast and unshaken,\\" he said in a televised statement. \\"We will fend off the aggression. \\"We are all confident in our intrepid resistance fighters who are now deployed on the front.\\" Late on Thursday, BBC correspondents in Gaza reported several massive explosions and missile fire in and around Gaza City as Israeli strikes continued. Many of the Palestinians killed in Gaza during the last two days by the Israeli aerial and naval bombardment were members of militant groups, but civilians - including at least four children - were also among the dead. They included 11-month-old Omar, the son of Jihad Misharawi, a BBC Arabic picture editor. The three Israeli civilians who died - two women and a man - were killed on the top floor of a block of flats in the southern town of Kiryat Malachi that suffered a direct hit by a rocket. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will do \\"everything in its power\\" to avoid civilian casualties in the conflict with Hamas. But he said Hamas was deliberately placing its rockets and missiles in civilian areas prior to launching them at Israel. \\"There is no moral symmetry between Israel and the terrorists in Gaza,\\" he said during a televised news conference in Tel Aviv. \\"Hamas deliberately targets our children and they deliberately place their rockets next to their children. Now despite this reality - and it's a difficult reality - Israel will continue to do everything in its power to avoid civilian casualties.\\" Egypt's new Islamist President Mohammed Mursi called the Israeli bombardment \\"unacceptable aggression\\". Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil is to travel to Gaza on Friday in a show of support for the people of the territory. The United States, Israel's key ally, has called on countries that have contact with Hamas to urge it to stop rocket attacks from Gaza. \\"We've... urged those that have a degree of influence with Hamas such as Turkey, and Egypt and some of our European partners to use that influence to urge Hamas to de-escalate,\\" said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, in a conference call with reporters. Asked if the US was concerned that Israeli ground forces would enter Gaza, Mr Rhodes said: \\"Ultimately it's up to the Israeli government to make determinations about how they're going to carry out their military objectives.\\" Arab League foreign ministers plan to meet in emergency session on Friday to discuss the escalating violence. Israel's aerial and naval bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which began after a recent wave of rocket attacks from there, is its most intense assault on the Palestinian territory since it launched a full-scale invasion four years ago, also in response to rocket fire.","completion":"People living in a city had to hide because they were warned that something dangerous was flying towards them.

The Surrealist, as well as the Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon interview.Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". The 1994 single \\"Ping Pong\\" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views.

Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition, The Combat was bought from Etty by fellow artist John Martin for 300 guineas (about £24,000 in 2019 terms), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete. The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.The 1832 exhibition of Youth on the Prow, and...

What is the last name of the person who discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart? Answer the above question based on the context below: After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus. Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring. The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor. A couple of victims of the scam die amidst the brutality of their captors.","completion":"Based on the provided context, the person who discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster is Edgar Allan Poe.

Solve -10*p + 5 + 39 + 134 = -12 for p.","completion":"To solve the equation -10*p + 5 + 39 + 134 = -12 for p, we will first simplify the equation by combining like terms and then isolating the variable p. Follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. -10*p + 5 + 39 + 134 = -12 Since 5, 39, and 134 are constants, we can add them. 5 + 39 + 134 = 178 So the equation becomes: -10*p + 178 = -12 Step 2: Isolate the variable p by moving the constant term to the right side of the equation. To move the constant term (178) to the right side, we subtract it from both sides of the equation. -10*p + 178 - 178 = -12 - 178 -10*p = -190 Step 3: Solve for p by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p (-10). To get the value of p, we divide both sides by -10. (-10*p) / -10 = -190 / -10 p = 19 So, the solution to the equation, -10*p + 5 + 39 + 134 = -12, for p is p = 19."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Steve hurried through his tests, and continued to dream of other things. His heart was not in school, but in the woods. One day, Miss White's impatient voice broke into his daydreams. \\"Steve! Pay attention!\\" Steve turned to look at her, fixing his eyes on Miss White, as she began to go over the test results for the seventh grade. \\"You all did pretty well,\\" she told the class, \\"except for one boy, and it breaks my heart to tell you this, but...\\" She hesitated, her eyes searching his face. \\"...The smartest boy in the seventh grade is failing my class!\\" She just stared at Steve. Steve dropped his eyes. After that, it was war! Steve still wouldn't do his homework. Even as the punishments became more severe, he remained _ \\"Just try it! ONE WEEK!\\" He was unmoved. \\"You're smart enough! You'll see a change!\\" Nothing touched him. \\"Give yourself a chance! Don't give up on your life!\\" Nothing. \\"Steve! Please! I care about you!\\" Wow! Suddenly, Steve got it! Someone cared about him? Steve went home from school, thoughtful, that afternoon. Walking into the house, both parents were out. He, quickly, gathered up a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, a bottle of water, and this time...his schoolbooks. The following Monday he arrived at school on time, and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom. She walked in, all smiles! God, she was beautiful! Miss White, immediately, gave a quiz on the weekend homework. Steve hurried through the test and was the first to hand in his paper. With a look of surprise, Miss White took his paper. Obviously puzzled, she began to look it over. Miss White's face was in total shock! The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test! From that moment nothing was the same for Steve. Life at home remained the same, but life still changed. He discovered that not only could he learn, but he was good at it! He discovered that he could understand knowledge and translate the things... Question: Steve used to be bad at his lessons because _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"he hadn't put his heart into his studies\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"he hadn't put his heart into his studies\\" is accurate based on the information provided in the text. The story describes how Steve was uninterested in school and more focused on daydreaming and his fondness for the woods, indicating a lack of engagement with his studies. He hurried through tests and did not do his homework, demonstrating a lack of effort and commitment to his education. Further, the narrative shows that once Steve became aware that someone cared about him, specifically Ms. White, his attitude towards school work changed significantly. He started to take homework, arrived on time for school, and even managed to pass a test. His changed attitudes suggest that his previous poor performance was largely due to his lack of investment and interest in academics. His life at home remained stable, indicating that the environment was not a key factor affecting his study. The narrative also does not outline examples of learning difficulties or intellectual limitations that could have hindered Steve's academic progress. Thus the assertion that \\"he hadn't put his heart into his studies\\" appears to be a comprehensive explanation for Steve's initial poor academic performance. In conclusion, Steve's academic difficulties stemmed from his lack of emotional investment and focus on his studies. His shift in attitude towards schoolwork, coupled with his inherent smartness, were key components that lead to his academic improvement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I am not going to spoil the contents to anyone, who has not yet watched this humble masterpiece by Kay Pollak. A world famous conductor brilliantly played by Michael Nyqvist seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village. The villagers, who has followed the genius in silence, are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness. Each role in this movie, has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but precise words, a symphony of love. Not love in the sense of relationship, but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters, each revealing their own present story, their needs, their skeletons, desires and much more. I shall not forget to mention, the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmonies of emotional feedback. They touch each other with a pain connected in their own disability to love themselves. Michael Nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup, in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic. And fantastic it became from start to end, not one second less or more than enough, you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more.

An American flag still stands next to one of more than 170 toppled Jewish headstones after a weekend vandalism attack on Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in University City, a suburb of St Louis, Mo., on Feb. 21. (Tom Gannam/Reuters) After the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis over the long holiday weekend, an incident in which more than 150 headstones were toppled or damaged, two American Muslim activists started a fundraiser to help pay for needed repairs. “Through this campaign, we hope to send a united message from the Jewish and Muslim communities that there is no place for this type of hate, desecration, and violence in America,” the fundraising page on the site LaunchingGood reads. “We pray that this restores a sense of security and peace to the Jewish-American community who has undoubtedly been shaken by this event.” Within a few hours of going up Tuesday afternoon, the page had exceeded its goal of raising 20,000. Tarek El-Messidi, who created the campaign with fellow activist Linda Sarsour said when he saw the news about the vandalism at Chesed Shel Emeth Society cemetery in the St. Louis suburb of University City, he was reminded of a story about the prophet Muhammad, who had stood up when a Jewish funeral procession passed. When asked why, he said, “Is it not a human soul?” “That story goes to show more than anything the humanity of the prophet. … We should bring the story to life here and show every person deserves to rest in peace,” El-Messidi said. “This is a great way to show respect and honor for our Jewish cousins.” Missouri authorities are investigating after dozens of headstones were damaged at a Jewish cemetery near St.Louis. (AP) Through his nonprofit, Celebrate Mercy, El-Messidi’s mission is to not only educate people about the prophet’s teachings but also to rally Muslims to respond to evil with good. A national Muslim leader in Knoxville, Tenn., he helped launch a Muslim-led fundraiser for the victims of the San Bernardino terrorist attack in 2015 that ultimately raised more than 215,000. In 2012, after the attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, El-Messidi called on Muslims to write condolence letters to the Stevens’s family and presented 8,000 of them to Steven’s sister that Thanksgiving. [American Muslims ‘grieve for the victims like any other human being,’ raise more than 170,000 for San Bernardino families] Since the rise of hate crime incidents after the November election, both Muslim and Jewish communities in the United States have been targeted, their institutions are threatened, their people bullied. It’s a shared experience that is bringing them together in solidarity, El-Messidi said. “This is really a human issue,” he said. “But out of this horrible election cycle, something beautiful has come out of it and [Muslims and Jews have] bonded together to support each other and stand up to this hate. Politics can get in the way of our basic humanity; I hope this breaks through all those walls, no pun intended, to help bring us closer together.” To underscore this point, El-Messidi shared a message he received from a woman named Barbara: You have helped to heal the pain in my heart. I live in Los Angeles but was born and raised in St. Louis. I have family buried in that cemetery and was heartbroken seeing the desecration of the final resting place of some of my loved ones. Your kind and loving spirit gives hope to me that we can have mutual respect and tolerance of our differences and shared humanity. Bless you. El-Messidi said he has been communicating with the director of the cemetery who was going to send him an exact estimate of the damages, but he doesn’t have that figure yet. If they raise more than is needed, he said they will keep a leftover fund that will be used to counter anti-Semitic hate.

Greitens said President Donald Trump called him Wednesday morning to thank the people of Missouri \\"for standing up in the fight against anti-Semitism.\\" Pence thanked residents for their efforts to restore the toppled headstones and said, \\"There is no place in America for hatred or acts of prejudice or violence or anti-Semitism.\\" After Pence and Greitens concluded their remarks, they prayed with others at the scene, then Pence picked up a rake and helped in the cleanup.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review provided for the product in question depicts the product in an unflattering light, as it highlights several negative aspects and expresses dissatisfaction with its performance. There are a few reasons behind this conclusion: 1. Inaccuracy: The reviewer states that the product often has an error margin of more than 1mm. This suggests that the product fails to deliver consistent and accurate results, which could be detrimental for certain applications where precision is crucial. 2. Inconsistency: The reviewer mentions that the product does not repeat its readings. This lack of repeatability can be problematic, as users must rely on consistent measurements in order to confidently compare results or track changes in the properties being measured. 3. Constant resetting: According to the reviewer, the product requires frequent resetting to zero. This might indicate flawed calibration, as the device should retain its zero point for accurate measurements. Having to constantly reset the zero point is inconvenient, time-consuming, and could lead to further inaccuracies in the results. 4. LCD flashing: The reviewer cites that the LCD display continues to flash, even after they replaced the battery. This can be a source of distraction and frustration, hindering the overall user experience. It might also suggest a fault in the electronic components. 5. Designation as \\"total junk\\": Lastly, the reviewer labels the product as \\"total junk,\\" which is an unequivocal expression of dissatisfaction. This strong negative statement further emphasizes the unflattering nature of the review.

Passage:In 1964 he moved to Santa Monica, California, and formed Rising Sons with fellow blues rock musician Ry Cooder and Jessie Lee Kincaid, landing a record deal with Columbia Records soon after. The group was one of the first interracial bands of the period, which likely made them commercially unviable. An album was never released (though a single was) and the band soon broke up, though Legacy Records did release The Rising Sons Featuring Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder in 1992 with material from that period. During this time Mahal was working with others, musicians like Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Guy, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Muddy Waters. Mahal stayed with Columbia after the Rising Sons to begin his solo career, releasing the self-titled Taj Mahal in 1968, The Natch'l Blues in 1969, and Giant Step/De Old Folks at Home with Kiowa session musician Jesse Ed Davis from Oklahoma, who played guitar and piano (also in 1969). During this time he and Cooder worked with the Rolling Stones, with whom he has performed at various times throughout his career. In 1968, he performed in the film The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus. He recorded a total of twelve albums for Columbia from the late 1960s into the 1970s. His work of the 1970s was especially important, in that his releases began incorporating West Indian and Caribbean music, jazz and reggae into the mix. In 1972, he acted in and wrote the film score for the movie Sounder, which starred Cicely Tyson. He reprised his role and returned as composer in the sequel, Part 2, Sounder.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background. This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 Portrait of a Man, Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa in front of a landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view – popularised during the Italian Quattrocento – towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer. The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer. Van Eyck's 1433 Portrait of a Man is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer. Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits or in the case of potential... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Hans Memling"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The heir apparent of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 was Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. He was born on December 18, 1863, in Graz, Austria, and was the eldest son of Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria, the younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was formally known as Franz Ferdinand Karl Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria, and he was a member of the House of Habsburg, one of the most powerful royal families in European history. As the heir presumptive to the throne, he held the title of Archduke of Austria-Este, a title primarily used by the heirs apparent to the Habsburg rulers since the 15th century. While Emperor Franz Joseph's relations with his nephew were somewhat strained due to Franz Ferdinand's unconventional marriage to Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, a lady-in-waiting who was not of equal rank or with the equal royal lineage required for a Habsburg marriage, Franz Ferdinand's position as the heir apparent was not contested. Emperor Franz Joseph eventually gave his blessing to the marriage, but it resulted in a morganatic union, meaning Sophie and her descendants would not have a claim to the Habsburg titles or the throne. Despite the controversy surrounding his personal life, Franz Ferdinand was known to have progressive ideas for the future governance of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He recognized the need for political, military, and economic reform to address the increasing tensions among the empire's numerous ethnic groups, as well as to solidify the empire's position against its rivals in Europe. However, Franz Ferdinand's time as heir apparent would be tragically cut short due to his assassination on June 28, 1914, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist part of the Black Hand secret society. The assassination sparked a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire issued an ultimatum to Serbia, leading to a web of alliances being activated across Europe, plunging the continent into a devastating conflict. Following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and his wife, the next heir presumptive to the throne became Archduke Karl Franz Joseph, the grandnephew of Emperor Franz Joseph, who would later ascend the throne as Emperor Karl I of Austria and King Charles IV of Hungary. Unfortunately, World War I would bring the downfall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, leading to its dissolution and the end of the Habsburg rule in 1918."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Possible A: enjoy, tasty, health problems, hunger, indigestion Why is \\"tasty\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Tasty\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses a fundamental aspect of human experience and preferences when it comes to food consumption. In general, people tend to eat food that they find enjoyable and flavorful. This proclivity for seeking out palatable meals and snacks is the result of a combination of factors, including evolution, biology, and individual experiences. From an evolutionary perspective, finding food tasty serves a critical function in encouraging humans to consume the necessary nutrients and energy sources to survive and thrive. When a person finds a particular food, such as a hamburger, tasty, they are more likely to consume it again in the future, which can contribute to their ongoing search for sustenance. Additionally, tastiness also signals that the food is likely safe to eat, as historically, our ancestors often associated bitter or sour tastes with potential toxins or harmful substances. Biologically, the sensation of taste is mediated by the presence of taste receptors on our tongue, which are specialized cells that are responsible for detecting the presence of different molecules in the food we eat. When the taste receptors sense the molecules responsible for giving food its flavor, they relay that information to the brain, which interprets the signal as a subjective perception of taste. In the case of hamburgers, several factors contribute to their tastiness, such as the satisfying umami taste of the meat, the combination of spices and seasonings, and the interplay between textures (e.g., the crunchiness of lettuce, the softness of the bun, and the juicy consistency of the patty). These factors work together to create a pleasurable and memorable eating experience that drives a person to seek out more of that specific food. Additionally, individual experiences and cultural upbringing also play a role in shaping a person's perceptions of tastiness. People raised in environments where hamburgers are a popular and readily available food option might be more likely to enjoy them and crave them than those who grew up without exposure to such meals. Also, the psychological component of comfort brought by familiar tastes and associations with positive memories (e.g., enjoying burgers during family gatherings, celebrations, or social events) can further contribute to the increased appeal of hamburgers. In conclusion, the answer \\"tasty\\" is aligned with human common sense because it addresses the core components of human food preferences, including evolutionary drives, biological processes, individual experiences and cultural factors that shape our perception of the enjoyable flavors in food. Eating hamburgers can be an indulgence that is both satisfying and comforting, and the gratifying taste serves as a powerful motivator for people to continue craving and consuming them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

In March 2003, Miller was introduced to Jeff Hancock, a one-on-one therapist for people with autism, and things started to feel a little more manageable. Hancock was hired to be John's companion. The two would go people-watching at the mall in Stuart, Florida, on the weekends. Hancock chatted throughout their excursions, even though John couldn't talk back. Their relationship evolved when Hancock introduced John to the Special Olympics in Martin County. Hancock, a longtime volunteer for the organization, and Miller decided John should get involved in sports after they saw a rare sight: Whenever John was running or being active, he was smiling.

Step 2: Wash the potato Wash the potato by running it under lukewarm water to remove any dirt or impurities. Gently scrub the surface using your hands or a soft brush. This ensures that your peeled potato will be clean. Step 3: Position the potato on the cutting board Place the clean potato on the cutting board, which will provide a steady surface for peeling. Step 4: Grip the potato and the peeler Hold the potato firmly using your non-dominant hand, keeping your fingers away from the area you will be peeling. Hold the potato peeler or knife securely using your dominant hand. Step 5: Begin peeling Using the potato peeler, place the blade at the top of the potato and apply slight pressure while moving the peeler away from your hand, following the curvature of the potato. If using a knife, follow the same process but be cautious not to remove too much of the potato or cut yourself. Step 6: Rotate and repeat Rotate the potato as needed to peel all sides. Continue peeling until the entire potato has been rid of its skin. Step 7: Inspect for missed spots After you have peeled the entire potato, inspect it for any remaining spots of skin or imperfections and remove them using the peeler or knife as necessary. Step 8: Rinse the peeled potato Once the potato has been fully peeled, rinse it under water to remove any remaining bits of skin or debris. Step 9: Store or use the peeled potato Transfer the peeled potato to the bowl or container, or immediately use it for your desired cooking purposes.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials? , can you please find it? Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and...

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: The southern province was exposed to intensive grazing for many years , and now soil quality is poor and dust storms are present. The northern province has more fertile soil, more trees. But I can use this background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. What is an answer for this question: Which province experiences more carbon loss? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the southern province likely experiences more carbon loss. This conclusion can be drawn from the various observations regarding the degradation of this province's land. The southern province has been subjected to intensive grazing for many years, which has resulted in poor soil quality and frequent dust storms. Degraded lands, such as the ones in this province, often face a decline in biodiversity and loss of essential nutrients, like water, nitrogen, and carbon. The decrease in biodiversity consequently makes the ecosystem less adaptable to disasters, impacts the available food supply for animals, and contributes to the decline of plant and animal species. As mentioned in the provided background details, the loss of carbon and nitrogen in the Tibetan Plateau led to substantial economic losses. Since the southern province displays many signs of degradation, such as poor soil quality and increased dust storms, it can be assumed that this province has experienced higher carbon loss compared to the northern province. In contrast, the northern province features more fertile soil and a greater number of trees, which indicates better soil quality and higher carbon retention. Trees are natural carbon sinks and serve as essential elements in maintaining the balance of carbon in ecosystems. Therefore, considering the provided information, it can be concluded that the southern province likely experiences more carbon loss than the northern province due to the severe effects of degradation in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I know he didn't mean to hurt me, but I was mad about it all. Day. Long. I just couldn't get over the fact that he technically hit me! I started to consider things like, “Is he really sorry?” “Will he do it again?” “Should I leave him?” And gave myself reasons like “He didn't mean to!” “He's been apologizing all day!” “He was just playing!” “He meant to have fun, He's sorry!” Yet countered it with one simple statement, “Yeah that's what all abused women say.” In the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: “If I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?” and the answer was “No”, so obviously I shouldn't leave him. He is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again.

However, my excitement was short-lived as I was met with a series of letdowns that called into question whether it was worth the effort, time, and resources. I am disappointed to say that my expectations were not met, and I will be sharing my thoughts on what went wrong in this review. Upon walking into The Hyped Haven, the first thing I noticed was the lack of proper lighting. The place felt drab and unwelcoming, a far cry from the trendy and cozy atmosphere I had anticipated. The dim lighting did not do the aesthetically pleasing décor justice, as it was difficult to appreciate its uniqueness. Moving on to the service, this was another aspect that left me less than impressed. The waiting staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganized as they took an unusually long time to greet us, get the menus, and take our order. When I asked for recommendations, the server, albeit polite, appeared unsure of what to suggest and seemed to have little knowledge of the items on the menu. The food arrived after an agonizing wait of over 45 minutes. This would not have been an issue if the quality of the food had made up for the delay. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I ordered the Chef's Special Pasta, while my partner opted for the highly praised Haven Burger. My pasta was overcooked, and the sauce was overly rich and heavy on the salt. It lacked a harmonious balance of flavors, and the experience of eating it was underwhelming. The burger, although cooked to the right temperature, was drowning in a pool of condiments which inhibited the taste of the beef patty and toppings. Sadly, the desserts did not save the day either. The Chocolate Lava Cake was underbaked in the middle, making it runny and unappealing with every bite. My partner's Panna Cotta was too stiff, indicating that too much gelatin was employed, and the accompanying fruit coulis lacked brightness in its taste. The ambience proved to be another fail. The noise level was surprisingly high, making it difficult for us to maintain a conversation. Between the loud music and other diners’ chatter, my partner and I were not able to relax and focus on our dining experience. Ultimately, the prices failed to justify the unfavorable experience we had. Given that The Hyped Haven is considered an upscale eatery with fairly steep prices, we expected them to deliver both quality service and exceptional food. In this case, the combined factors led to our overall disappointment. In conclusion, I had a negative experience at The Hyped Haven and would recommend potential visitors to think twice before visiting. With numerous other restaurants in the area offering better service, food, and atmosphere, I find it hard to justify returning when there are countless superior alternatives. I sincerely hope The Hyped Haven takes this review to heart and makes the necessary improvements to ensure future customers do not undergo the same disappointment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Luis Suarez's actions during the 2014 World Cup match between Uruguay and Italy were unacceptable and have no place in the sport of football. Biting an opponent on the shoulder is not only dangerous, but it also demonstrates a complete lack of respect for both the game and fellow players. Therefore, to hold him accountable, the experts at Sportsmail believe that Suarez should receive a punishment that would send a strong message, not only to the player himself, but also to the entire footballing community. The proposed worldwide 15-match ban would be a significant penalty, as it would impact not only Suarez's international career, but also his future performance at the club level. By serving such an extensive ban, Suarez would miss key matches and have to work diligently to regain the trust and support of his coaches, teammates, and fans. In addition to the ban, experts also suggest that Suarez should face additional consequences for his actions. This could include a mandatory anger management course, a hefty fine, and a public apology to Giorgio Chiellini, the victim of the bite, as well as the entire footballing community. Furthermore, this incident offers an opportunity for FIFA to address the prevalence of unsportsmanlike conduct in the sport and to set a strong precedent for future offenders. Implementing stricter punishments and promoting fair play would serve as crucial steps in safeguarding the integrity of the game and ensuring that all players respect the rules. In conclusion, Luis Suarez should face a comprehensive punishment including a worldwide 15-match ban, therapy or anger management, financial penalties, and issuing a formal apology, to deter any future occurrences of such behavior. This disciplinary action would emphasize the importance of sportsmanship and respect in the game of football and serve as a reminder that unsportsmanlike conduct will not be tolerated, both on and off the pitch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Photo: Dennis di Cicco Sky & Telescope) Story Highlights Sunday and Monday nights are the best times to see the annual meteor shower The fireballs will streak across the sky at nearly 134,000 miles per hour You will have to stay up late; the best viewing comes from midnight to dawn Put out the lawn chair, set the alarm and maybe bring something to wet your whistle while you gaze into the nighttime sky — the year's best shooting star show has started. August's annual Perseids meteor shower peaks Sunday and Monday, promising perhaps 70 meteors an hour those evenings. \\"The Perseids are the good ones,\\" says meteorite expert Bill Cooke of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. The Perseids take their name from their apparent origin in the constellation Perseus, the hero of ancient Greek myth born from a shower of heavenly gold. Known for producing fireballs that might streak across a third of the sky, they owe their brilliance to the speed — nearly 134,000 mph — with which they smack into the upper atmosphere. \\"It's also because of the size of the meteors,\\" Cooke says. The dust grains are about one-fifth of an inch across and burn nicely as they zip overhead. Those dust grains come courtesy of Comet Swift-Tuttle, which circles the sun once every 133 years and leaves behind a debris trail. (Comets are basically dirty snowballs that develop tails when they approach the sun and start to melt. Different ones are responsible for other regular meteor showers, such as April's Lyrids, brought by Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher, and November's Leonids brought by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.) You will have to stay up late to see the Perseids at their peak; the best viewing comes from midnight to dawn, particularly after the half-full moon sets at 1 a.m. on Monday, says Astronomy magazine's Michael Bakich. But they should appear at night during the week before and after the peak as well. \\"Get out of the city and the lights to give yourself a chance to see them,\\" Bakich says. The rule of thumb is that you should be able to see all the stars of the Big Dipper — seven stars if you are counting — to give yourself enough darkness to catch the shooting stars. And give your eyes an hour to adjust. \\"There will be a dozen 'ooh' moments in that hour,\\" Bakich says. \\"Ones when everyone will say, 'Did you see that?'\\" Astronaut Ron Garan looks down on a Perseid meteor from the International Space Station. (Photo: Ron Garan / NASA) Although the shooting stars seem to come from the constellation Perseus, don't look there to see them, Bakich advises. Instead, look about one-third of the sky down and away from the constellation to spot meteors streaking across the sky. \\"That makes them easier to pick out,\\" he says. While you are enjoying the sky show, satellite operators are buttoning up spacecraft to protect them from the onslaught of comet dust, says Cooke, who prepares meteor shower forecasts each year for space businesses. While the 2013 Perseid shower won't affect the Hubble Space Telescope, according to Janet Anderson of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., at other times it might point the opening to its mirrors away from the direction of an outburst of meteors. Other satellites might turn vulnerable antennas away from them as well. Clouds permitting, Cooke advises skywatchers this year to take their time and enjoy the nighttime show. \\"All you need is to lie flat on your back, and the reward is meteors.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1ev828w ||||| One of the year's best astronomical events will light up the sky for the next five nights. Best of all, it's really easy to observe. You don't need telescopes or cameras, just a deckchair, blankets and a hot thermos to keep you company. Wait until late at night. If the sky is clear, find the darkest site you can with a clear eastern horizon. Plonk yourself down in the chair facing east, cover up with the blanket and wait. The Perseid meteor shower is expected to peak in the pre-dawn skies on both 12 and 13 August. The Perseids were once part of comet Swift-Tuttle. At 27 kilometres across, this is one of the largest. It orbits the sun every 133 years and last passed by in 1992. Whenever it approaches, the heat of the sun disintegrates its ice, creating a dusty tail and replenishing the Perseid stream. The Earth passes through this stream every August, sparking the meteor shower. Each one of the meteors, sometimes called shooting stars, that you see is a tiny speck of dust as old as the formation of Earth and the other planets, 4.6bn years ago. It burns with incandescent glory because it has hit our atmosphere at a speed of 160,000 kilometres per hour (100,000 miles per hour). This creates a shockwave that compresses a pocket of air in front of the dust grain and raises it to a temperature of a few thousand degrees. This is enough to burn up the dust and create a bright meteor. Swift Tuttle is the largest object to regularly pass Earth. Its orbit is known well enough for astronomers to believe it does not pose a collision hazard for at least the next 2,000 years.

Photograph: Vassil Donev/EPA The Perseids are generally considered the most active and reliable of the 64 meteor showers that Earth passes through every year. A recent Nasa study found that it offers the best chance out of all the meteor showers of seeing an ultra-bright meteor called a fireball. Even if you don't see a fireball, you are guaranteed that there will be dozens of ordinary meteors every hour – providing the sky is clear and you can stay awake.

Stargazers are in for a show again on Monday night as the peak of the Perseid meteor shower once again illuminates the night sky. Perseid meteors are particles from the debris trail on the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle and hit the Earth's atmosphere moving at 132,000 mph. Unfortunately, clouds and showers threaten to obscure the show across a large swath of the country on Monday night. Most places from the East Coast through the Tennessee Valley and the central Plains will have to find breaks in the clouds to enjoy the show. The best places to view the Perseid's will be across much of Florida, Texas and the Great Lakes, where the sky should be mostly clear for much of the night. Much of the West will also have good viewing conditions. The nation's midsection will not catch much of the shower as a front slowly sags southward, posing a threat for violent and drenching thunderstorms. RELATED: Latest U.S. Satellite AccuWeather.com Astronomy Blog Share Your Pictures of the Meteor Shower Much of the Northeast will also miss the display thanks to a front moving in from the west. During the peak, the moon will be in a crescent phase, and will set in the sky by midnight in most locations. The dark sky will aid in the spectacle, allowing even fainter meteors to be seen. \\"Any time you have a darker sky, that helps,\\" AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Mark Paquette said. The shower, nicknamed the \\"Fireball Champion,\\" produces more meteors than any other annual shower and is typically bright enough at its peak to be seen in areas that suffer some light pollution. \\"Most people consider this the best meteor shower of all to see shooting stars,\\" Paquette said. If the weather or other plans prevented you from viewing the meteor shower on Sunday night, the show should be just as brilliant on Monday night--weather dependent. |||||Summary:","completion":"The Perseids meteor shower is an annual event that peaks around August 12-13, lighting up the night sky as Comet Swift-Tuttle's debris trail collides with Earth's atmosphere. The meteorites can travel at speeds of nearly 134,000 miles per hour and can produce spectacular fireball displays. The best viewing times are from midnight to dawn, away from city lights. The Perseids meteor shower is considered one of the best astronomical events of the year as it offers excellent chances of seeing bright and fast meteors. The Perseid meteors get their name from their apparent origin in the constellation Perseus, which is related to ancient Greek mythology. The debris trail is left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every 133 years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No; The suggested answer focuses on the music video directed by Anton Corbijn and its critical acclaim rather than addressing the actual question about what the song \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is about. A more appropriate and detailed answer would be: \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, written by the band's frontman Kurt Cobain. The song was released as the first single from their third and final studio album, \\"In Utero\\" in 1993. While the interpretation of the song's meaning can vary, Kurt Cobain has mentioned in interviews that the lyrics were inspired by several themes, such as his personal and professional life, obsession, and love. The term \\"heart-shaped box\\" is believed to symbolize both love and the human body. In some interpretations, it represents a box that Cobain's then-wife Courtney Love had gifted to him filled with memorabilia, symbolizing their relationship. Another interpretation reflects that the song could be about Cobain's complex feelings towards the music industry and the feelings of being trapped by fame. In terms of the music video, it was indeed directed by Anton Corbijn and received critical acclaim. The video's imagery, which includes scenes of an old man climbing a crucifix, fetuses hanging on trees, and a heart in a box, contributes to the overall dark and surreal tone that further emphasizes the song's themes. To validate the answer, it would be important to focus on the themes and interpretations of the song itself in addition to the music video's role in portraying those themes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1990 just over half the cocaine imported into the U.S. came through Mexico, by 2007 that had risen to more than 90 percent, according to U.S. State Department estimates. Although violence between drug cartels has been occurring long before the war began, the government used its police forces in the 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century with little effect. That changed on December 11, 2006, when newly elected Mexican President Felipe Calderón sent 6,500 federal troops to the state of Michoacán to put an end to drug violence there. This action is regarded as the first major retaliation made against cartel operations, and is generally viewed as the starting point of the Mexican Drug War. As time progressed, Calderón continued to escalate his anti-drug campaign, in which there are now well over 25,000 troops involved. During the Felipe Calderón, the Mexican government has spent approximately US7 billion in an 18-month-old campaign against drug cartels. It is estimated that during 2006, there were about 2,000 drug-related violent deaths, about 2,300 deaths during 2007, and more than 6,200 people by the end of 2008. Many of the dead were gang members killed by rivals or by the government, some have been bystanders.

It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases can be released by factories that burn fossil fuels. Over the past 20 years, burning fossil fuels has produced about three-quarters of the carbon dioxide from human activity.

The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, results in the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases are known to trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to the overall increase in global temperatures, a phenomenon known as global warming. Additionally, Long Island's industrial activity and other human activities likely resulted in deforestation, or the large-scale clearing of trees, to make way for development. As mentioned in the hint, trees are natural carbon sinks and absorb CO2 during the process of photosynthesis. When trees are cut down and forests destroyed, the ability of these ecosystems to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is severely compromised, further exacerbating the effects of global warming. On the other hand, Snail Island was characterized by its mindfulness towards environmental protection and conservation. With fewer people living there, resource consumption and the subsequent release of greenhouse gases were inherently lower than those of Long Island. Snail Island's focus on preserving the natural environment led to a reduced strain on its resources, and a lesser release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This allowed the island to play a lesser role in contributing to global warming. In conclusion, Long Island, with its densely populated regions, resource-intensive lifestyle, and reliance on fossil fuels, contributed significantly more to global warming compared to Snail Island, which prioritized environmental preservation and had a smaller population. The combined impact of greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and deforestation on Long Island far exceeded the environmental footprint of Snail Island, making it a larger contributor to the global warming process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who systematically kills several key South Korean government figures over the next few years.Meanwhile, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. They are happy together, but Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Later, Park calls Yu and issues an ultimatum: he has concealed several CTX bombs around Seoul, and will give him just enough time to find each one before setting them off. It is revealed that Park...

They were running around, laughing, and having a great time. As they played, they began to feel very hot and thirsty because the sun was shining brightly and their bodies were working hard to keep up with all the fun they were having. Now, at the edge of the park, there was a little ice machine, full of cold and frosty ice cubes. Patricia saw it and thought, \\"Hmm, I could use some of that ice to cool down.\\" But then she remembered that she had just taken a big sip of water from her water bottle, and she wasn't as thirsty as her friend Katrina. So Patricia ignored the ice, because Katrina was the one who was really hot and thirsty, while Patricia had just drank some water. Patricia decided to share her water bottle with Katrina, so they could both stay cool and hydrated while they continued playing in the park.

A political decoy is a person employed to impersonate a politician, to draw attention away from the real person or to take risks on that person's behalf.

A political decoy impersonates someone for the fun of it. Select from: [+] Yes [+] It's impossible to say [+] No","completion":"[+] No The sentence \\"A political decoy impersonates someone for the fun of it\\" is not true based on the given paragraph. Based on the provided information, a political decoy impersonates a politician or other person of importance to either draw attention away from them or to take risks on their behalf. The primary motive behind employing a political decoy is not for pure amusement or entertainment, but rather to serve strategic, practical, security-related, and political purposes. While a political decoy might get some personal satisfaction or enjoyment out of the act of impersonation, the main intent is to protect the person they are impersonating and/or to further the goals and objectives of the person, organization, or government employing them. In this sense, it is not an activity undertaken purely for fun but a task typically carried out with specific objectives in mind. Moreover, the concept of a political decoy goes beyond simple impersonation. In many cases, these decoys must have a keen understanding of the person they impersonate, their mannerisms, beliefs, and speaking style, to convincingly portray that individual in public. Their roles may extend to participating in public events, speaking engagements, or even engaging in diplomatic relations—all with the aim of protecting the real individual. Throughout history, there have been several notable political decoys, which have played crucial roles in different capacities. For example, one of the most famous political decoys in history is the alleged use of body doubles by Joseph Stalin. These decoys were believed to have been used for a range of purposes, including public appearances, to help maintain the Soviet leader's authority and security. Another example is the use of impersonators by Saddam Hussein, who employed lookalikes to potentially thwart assassination attempts and confuse his enemies. In conclusion, political decoys primarily impersonate someone for strategic, security-related, or political reasons rather than for mere personal amusement. While some may find the act of impersonation enjoyable, the main purpose of their role is to provide protection, strategic advantage, or misinformation to benefit the person they impersonate or the organization employing them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: President Barack Obama raised 45 million for his re-election bid in February, bringing his total to about 300 million for this election cycle, his campaign said Monday. President Barack Obama speaks during a 'Lawyers for Obama Luncheon' fundraiser, Friday, March, 16, 2012, at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Associated Press) Obama increased fundraising efforts during the month, collecting nearly twice as much as the 23 million per month average he raised during the final three months of 2011 and more than the 29.1 million he raised in January. The money was spread among Obama's campaign, the Democratic party and two campaign funds. Obama's campaign said nearly 350,000 people contributed in February, and the average donation was about 59 for the entire election cycle. Nearly 98 percent of the donations were 250 or less. The fundraising reports were being filed ahead of a Tuesday campaign finance deadline for presidential campaigns. With Republicans locked in an extended primary campaign to win that party's nomination, Obama's team has tried to build a large 50-state operation that will help it register new voters, bring back past supporters and boost turnout. Obama's campaign had about 75 million in the bank through the end of January, and totals for February were not immediately available. Campaign officials have implored supporters to donate money and get involved, pointing to Republican-leaning super political action committees that are expected to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to defeat the president. Obama's campaign said earlier this year that it would bless big-money super PACs supporting Democrats as a way of countering the Republican effort. That was a turnaround from Obama's earlier opposition to the new groups. In an email to donors last week, campaign manager Jim Messina cited a poll showing Obama trailing against Republican front-runner Mitt Romney and asked them to get involved. \\"We're looking at a race that will be tighter than you think. And the other side has groups ready to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to tear down President Obama,\\" Messina said. Obama's totals for February fell short of the 56 million he raised in February 2008, when he was seeking the Democratic nomination against now-Secratary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Republicans said it was a sign of tepid support. Kirsten Kukowski, a Republican National Committee spokeswoman, said Obama was \\"having a hard time convincing voters he deserves another term\\" following three years of \\"record debt, high unemployment and soaring gas prices and health care costs.\\" Obama has boosted fundraising efforts in recent weeks, holding events last month in Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Last week, Obama raised money in Chicago and Atlanta. ||||| RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski reacts to President Obama's 45M February haul, noting that it's far less than his February 2008 haul: “After three years of policies that have left our country with record debt, high unemployment, and soaring gas prices and healthcare costs, it’s clear President Obama is having a hard time convincing voters he deserves another term. The president who ran on change and hope has left our country wanting and whether it’s showing in fundraising or in the polls, Americans are enthusiastic about replacing him in November.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"In February 2012, Barack Obama raised 45 million for his re-election campaign, taking the total funds raised thus far to approximately 300 million. This figure was nearly double the 23 million average per month he had raised during the final quarter of 2011 and an increase from the 29.1 million raised in January 2012. The donations were from almost 350,000 contributors, and about 98% of them were 250 or less—a significantly smaller sum than the 56 million he raised in February 2008 when he was competing for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Rodham Clinton. The funds were dispersed among the president's campaign, the Democratic party, and two campaign funds. The increase in fundraising efforts for February aimed to better consolidate support and counter the fundraising efforts of Republican-leaning super political action committees, which were expected to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to defeat Obama. Campaign manager Jim Messina cited a poll that showed Obama lagging behind Republican front-runner Mitt Romney and warned that the race would be tighter than expected. In response to the fundraising report, Republicans claimed that it showcased tepid support for Obama due to his administration's policies that led to a record debt, high unemployment, and growing gas prices and health care costs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Whom does Donald pretends to be? Movie title: Adaptation Movie plot: The self-loathing Charlie Kaufman is hired to write the screenplay for The Orchid Thief. Kaufman is going through depression and is not happy that his twin brother, Donald, has moved into his house and is taking advantage of him. Donald decides to become a screenwriter like Charlie and attends one of Robert McKee's famous seminars. Charlie, who rejects formulaic script writing, wants to ensure that his script is a faithful adaptation of The Orchid Thief. However, he comes to realize that the book does not have a usable narrative and that it is impossible to turn into a film, leaving him with a serious case of writer's block. Already well over his deadline with Columbia Pictures, and despairing at writing his script with self-reference, Charlie travels to New York to discuss the screenplay with Orlean directly. Unable to face her and with the surprising news that Donald's spec script for a clichÃ©d psychological thriller, called The 3, is selling for six or seven figures, Kaufman resorts to attending McKee's seminar in New York and asks him for advice. Charlie ends up asking Donald to join him in New York to assist with the story structure. Donald pretends to be Charlie and interviews Orlean, but is suspicious of her account of the events of her book because she acts as though she is lying. He and his brother Charlie follow Orlean to Florida where she meets Laroche, the orchid-stealing protagonist of Orlean's book and her secret lover. It is revealed that the Seminole wanted the ghost orchid in order to manufacture a drug that causes fascination; Laroche introduces this drug to Orlean. After Laroche and Orlean catch Charlie observing them taking the drug and having sex, she decides that Charlie must die. Orlean forces Charlie at gunpoint to drive to the swamp, where she intends to kill him.

But many people still admired him because he was so talented and had so many great ideas that made Apple better. Steve Jobs also went through some difficult times in his life.

He was known nationally by the mid-1830s. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? John Henry Newman was British.","completion":"Yes, the next sentence does follow given the preceding text. John Henry Newman (21 February 1801 – 11 August 1890) was a religious figure from England in the 19th century, as mentioned in the text. Since England is a part of the United Kingdom, it is accurate to state that John Henry Newman was British. To provide more context and a detailed answer, John Henry Newman was born in London, England, which makes him a British national. Throughout his life, he made significant contributions to the religious landscape of England and the United Kingdom through his roles as an Anglican priest, poet, and theologian, and later as a Catholic cardinal. Newman was an influential figure in the Oxford Movement, which sought to revive the religious traditions and practices within the Church of England, inspired by the early Christian church and the High Church Anglican tradition. He played a key part in voicing the theological foundations for this movement. However, his journey to Catholicism, prompted by his interest in the Fathers of the Church and his growing discomfort with Anglicanism's theological inconsistencies, made Newman an increasingly controversial figure within English religious circles. In 1845, he converted to Roman Catholicism and was subsequently ordained as a Catholic priest. This conversion further fueled the controversy surrounding his beliefs, as the Anglican Church and Roman Catholic Church had a history of strained relations in England. Despite the controversy, Newman continued to work as a theologian, philosopher, and writer, contributing to the intellectual life of the Roman Catholic Church. In recognition of his contributions to theology, Pope Leo XIII elevated him to the rank of cardinal in 1879. Newman's works on theology and religious thought, particularly concerning the development of Christian doctrines, the nature of religious belief, and the relationship between faith and reason, had a lasting influence on both Anglican and Catholic traditions. In 2019, Newman was canonized as a saint by Pope Francis, further cementing his legacy as an important figure in British religious history."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Given the question: Process: - A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest - The birds lay eggs. Question: suppose more eggs are laid happens, how will it affect more baby birds will grow into adults. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"More The process outlined above describes the life cycle of a bird, which involves the bird laying eggs, the eggs hatching into baby birds, the baby birds eating and growing into adult birds, and then these adult birds finding mates and starting the process all over again. If more eggs are laid by the birds, this will directly impact the number of baby birds that will grow into adults. Laying more eggs will have a greater effect on the population because it increases the number of offspring that will grow into adults and potentially reproduce, thus adding more birds to the overall population. This increase in offspring can contribute to various impacts on the ecosystem and environment in which the birds reside. For example, a higher number of birds may lead to increased competition for resources such as food, water, and nesting sites among their own population and with other species as well. This can result in some birds not being able to find adequate amounts of food or an appropriate nesting site, which may potentially decrease the overall survival rate of the baby birds growing into adults. On the other hand, having more birds in the population can lead to a stronger presence against natural predators, as there will be more individuals available to defend against threats. This can also lead to a greater genetic diversity within the population, which may increase the adaptability and resilience of the species, making it more likely for them to survive and thrive in changing environments. The process of laying more eggs can also impact various ecological factors such as seed dispersal, pollination, and balance within food chains. For instance, if the bird species is a primary consumer and feeds on insects, an increased population could help to control insect populations, potentially having a beneficial impact on the ecosystem. Conversely, if their population becomes too high, it could ultimately lead to the decline of other species that the birds compete with or prey upon. In summary, laying more eggs will have a significant impact on the number of baby birds that will grow into adults. This effect can have a range of both positive and negative implications for the ecosystem and environment, based on the relationships between the bird species, their food sources, and their interactions with other organisms. Overall, the perturbation of laying more eggs can lead to a more significant effect on the number of baby birds growing into adults, influencing the bird population, their ecological roles, and the dynamics of the ecosystem in which they reside."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write the answer: Which English darts player has the nickname ‘Old Stoneface’?","completion":"The English darts player who has the nickname 'Old Stoneface' is John Lowe, one of the most iconic figures in the history of professional darts. Born on July 21, 1945, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England, Lowe began his professional darts career in the early 1970s and went on to establish himself as a top player in the world of darts for over three decades. John Lowe earned the nickname 'Old Stoneface' because of his stoic, unemotional demeanor, and poker-faced expressions during his matches, which many viewed as an essential psychological weapon against his opponents. He was known for his ability to maintain composure and concentration regardless of the situation in a match, which helped him to become one of the most successful darts players of all time. Throughout his illustrious career, Lowe has accumulated numerous accolades and records, making him a true legend in the history of darts. Some of his most notable achievements include: 1. Three-time World Champion: John Lowe won the prestigious Embassy World Championship title in 1979, 1987, and 1993. With these wins, he became the first player to win the world title in three different decades. 2. Two-time World Masters Champion: Lowe secured the prestigious Winmau World Masters title in 1976 and 1980, one of the premier events on the darts calendar. 3. One-time World Cup Singles Champion: In 1981, Lowe triumphed in the World Cup Singles competition held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 4. Numerous other titles: John Lowe's impressive resume also includes victories in the British Open, British Matchplay, North American Open, News of the World Darts Championship, Swedish Open, and Finnish Open, among others. 5. Groundbreaking achievement: In October 1984, John Lowe made history by becoming the first-ever darts player to score a televised nine-dart finish (maximum 501 points in just nine darts, considered a perfect game in darts) during the MFI World Matchplay in Slough, England. This exceptional feat saw him receive £102,000 in prize money, which was a record at the time. In addition to his numerous accolades and accomplishments, John Lowe was also a key figure in helping to popularize the sport of darts in the United Kingdom and around the world. His rivalry with fellow Englishman Eric Bristow paved the way for some unforgettable matches, elevating darts to new heights and drawing significant audiences to their duels. After retiring from professional darts, Lowe has remained connected to the sport he loves as a commentator, exhibition player, and coach.

Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative.

His parents had passed away when he was very young, and the kung fu school was the only home he had ever known. The boy, who was named Li, showed incredible talent and determination in mastering the martial art. He dreamed of one day becoming a famous kung fu master and bringing honor and fortune to the school that had raised him. One day, while practicing his forms in the courtyard, Li caught the attention of Wang, a wealthy and influential businessman in the village. Wang was impressed by Li's focus and skill, and he invited the young orphan to join him for dinner at his home. Li graciously accepted the invitation, and the seeds of a lasting friendship were sown. Over a splendid feast, Li discovered that Wang's daughter, Li's childhood friend, worked at a five-star French restaurant in the big city. She had honed her culinary skills and worked her way up to become the head chef. Wang was visibly proud of his daughter's achievements, and Li couldn't help but feel inspired by her success too. As they continued to bond during the meal, Wang expressed his love for the game of basketball. He told Li about a local basketball team he was sponsoring – First University. The team was good, but they were missing something – a new star player that would tip them into greatness. Wang Li saw something special in Li and, knowing the boy's extraordinary physical abilities, invited him to play basketball for First University as the new star of their team. Li felt honored and excited by the opportunity. Even though he had never played basketball before, Li accepted Wang's offer, ready for a new challenge in his life. In no time, Li's natural aptitude for sports paired with his kung fu skills helped him adapt rapidly to basketball. He soon rose to prominence as an exciting and unique player, capturing the imagination of fans both within and outside the First University. As the city's annual basketball championship approached, Li's team was well-aware of the hurdles they were about to face. Rumors swirled regarding the opposing team, known for their ruthless and dirty tactics to prevent First University from winning, up to and including injuring their star players, Shi-jie Ting Wei and Xiao Lan. Li's teammates were concerned and fearful, but Li stood steadfast, adamant about finding a way to overcome these challenges. Li decided to combine his kung fu skills with basketball techniques, creating a unique and unstoppable form of play. His teammates followed suit, training diligently under his guidance. This new fusion of martial arts and basketball seemed almost invincible, and Li knew they could triumph in the championship game as long as they played together and stayed focused. The day of the final match arrived, and the atmosphere at the stadium was electric. Wang Li, his daughter, the entire village, and the kung fu school had come to cheer for Li and the First University team. The opposing team tried their underhanded tactics to bring down Shi-jie Ting Wei and Xiao Lan, but Li and his teammates stood strong, fighting back with their newfound skills. In the end, Li's unwavering determination and innovative play inspired his team to victory, overcoming adversity and claiming the championship for First University. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, and Wang Li couldn't be prouder of his protégé. From that day on, Li was hailed as a hero in his village and the basketball community. He had proven that the power of determination, skill, and teamwork could overcome even the greatest challenges. And although Li's heart always yearned for the kung fu school that was his first home, he knew that he had found his place in the world on the basketball court as a shining example to others of what was possible when one's passion is fueled by resilience and perseverance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Obesity protects against radiographic joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through poorly defined mechanisms. Adipocytokines are produced in adipose tissue and modulate inflammatory responses and radiographic joint damage in animal models. The purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that adipocytokines modulate inflammation and radiographic joint damage in patients with RA.', 'We compared serum concentrations of leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and visfatin in 167 RA patients and 91 control subjects. The independent association between adipocytokines and body mass index (BMI), measures of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha]), and radiographic joint damage (Larsen score; n = 93 patients) was examined in RA patients by multivariable regression analysis first controlling for age, race, and sex, and then for obesity (BMI) and inflammation (TNFalpha, IL-6, and CRP).', 'Concentrations of all adipocytokines were significantly higher in RA patients than in controls; for visfatin and adiponectin, this association remained significant after adjusting for BMI, inflammation, or both. Visfatin concentrations were associated with higher Larsen scores, and this association remained significant after adjustment for age, race, sex, disease duration, BMI, and inflammation (odds ratio [OR] 2.38 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.32-4.29], P = 0.004). Leptin concentrations showed a positive association with the BMI (rho = 0.58, P < 0.01) and showed a negative association with the Larsen score after adjustment for inflammation (OR 0.32 [95% CI 0.17-0.61], P < 0.001), but not after adjustment for BMI (OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.42-1.73], P = 0.67).Question: Are adipocytokines associated with radiographic joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis?

Tracking what Republican lawmakers have said about Donald Trump Donald Trumpâs impending nomination has Republican lawmakers â many who are facing tough reelection bids this cycle â contemplating how closely to embrace him. Some have already refused to support him, while others are doing so with varying levels of excitement. Here are four ways lawmakers have approached the question and some notable lawmakers in each camp: Senator and former presidential candidate Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) has been one of the most outspoken critics of Trump in the Senate. Another, freshman Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, has called for a third-party candidate to mount a challenge and presumably whittle away at Trumpâs support. A common thread among the group: not being on the ballot in November. âHe has not displayed a respect for the Constitution.

In a sign of support coalescing behind Trump, nine of 20 House committee chairmen endorsed Trump in a joint statement on May 13. âRepublicans are committed to preventing what would be a third term of Barack Obama.â (Link) â[Campaign press release]: Kelly plans to support the nominee.

What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The text provides an overview of different positions of Republican lawmakers on Donald Trump's nomination in 2016. These positions are categorized into four main groups: strong critics, hesitant supporters, those expressing reluctant support for the sake of party unity, and enthusiastic supporters. 1. Criticism: There are those like Senator Lindsey O. Graham and Sen. Ben Sasse who have been outspoken critics of Trump. Their criticism focused on Trump's perceived disregard for the constitution and inconsistency as a conservative. They've made strong statements in public and on social media, calling for alternatives to Trump. 2. Hesitant Approach: Certain lawmakers, such as Speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, were more cautious with their support for Trump. Ryan, for instance, vocalized his desire to ensure that the Republican standard bearer indeed upholds their standards. The responses in this category ranged from expressing fear about the prospective nominee to declaring personal votes for other candidates in the primaries. 3. Reluctant Support: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is noted as expressing a strategy to \\"drop [Trump] like a hot rock\\" should he earn the nomination, but when Trump became the presumptive nominee, McConnell and other leaders began expressing support for him, although less enthusiastically. This group seemed to support Trump for the sake of party unity and to win down-ballot races. They made public pledges of support and issued joint statements endorsing Trump. 4. Enthusiastic Support: Finally, there were those who supported Trump's nomination enthusiastically. The most prominent in this group was Senator Jeff Sessions, who noted that Trump's response to America's situation was \\"pretty darn good\\", and felt that Trump was the candidate best poised to make America great again.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The candidate who is longing for election to the highest office in the United States must be native-born American citizen who is at least 35 years old and who has lived in the United States for at least 14 years. The election course is complicated, and the road to the Oval Office is long. Potential candidates must present papers stating their intention to seek their party's recommendation; delegates then choose from among those running some months later at the national conferences. Before that, however, each state holds a primary election that determines how the state's voters want the party's delegates to vote. Methods of choosing the delegates vary from state to state. At the conferences, there are speeches and often heated discussions. It may take several rounds of voting before delegates can agree on a candidate. On the final day of the meeting, the presidential candidate announces his or her choice for vice president. Election Day, by law, is the Tuesday that follows the first Monday in November. On this day, registered voters may cast their votes for president, vice president, and candidates for other federal state, and local offices. The popular vote, however, does not determine who will be president. The president is chosen by a vote of the Electoral College, a group of 538 citizens from the 50 states and the District of Columbia who are chosen to cast votes for the president and vice president. The rules for choosing electors, as with the delegates, vary. Each state also decides whether its electoral votes must reflect the popular vote. The number of electors in each state is determined by the number of representatives and senators that a state sends to Congress and, therefore, may change every 10 years, depending on the results of the United States census . The winner must get at least 270 of the electoral votes when the Electoral College meets in December of the election year.

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.

A: Answer:","completion":"When we move down a group of elements on the periodic table, the electronegativity of the elements generally decreases. So, the correct option is: IV. it decreases. The decrease in electronegativity occurs as we move down a group because the atomic size increases due to the addition of electron shells. These additional electron shells cause the outer electrons to be further away from the nucleus, leading to a weaker attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons. As a result, the ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons decreases, leading to a decrease in electronegativity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 3: Justify the statement The statement is justified because the growth of tree roots near a sidewalk can exert pressure on the surface, causing the sidewalk to crack. This is especially true if the roots are growing horizontally and expanding under the sidewalk, leading to an uneven surface and potential damage. Moreover, tree roots need space to grow and obtain nutrients; locating a tree near a sidewalk may limit the area in which roots can expand, causing them to push against the sidewalk, resulting in cracks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: To prepare the avocado pit for planting,","completion":"To prepare an avocado pit for planting, follow these steps: Step 1: Extract the pit - Cut open a ripe avocado carefully without harming the pit inside. - Remove the pit gently and wash off any remaining avocado flesh. - Pat the pit dry with a paper towel. Step 2: Identify the top and bottom of the pit - Look closely at the shape of the pit. The slightly pointier end is the top, and the flatter end is the bottom. - The top is the part of the pit that will sprout, while roots will grow from the bottom. Step 3: Insert toothpicks - Take 3-4 toothpicks and insert them evenly around the avocado pit's circumference, approximately halfway down its length. The toothpicks will provide support and prevent the pit from fully submerging in water. - Position the toothpicks so that they are sticking out at a slightly upward angle. Step 4: Suspend the pit over a glass or jar - Place the avocado pit with the toothpicks over a glass or jar, ensuring the bottom part of the pit is submerged in water. - Make sure the glass or jar is transparent so you can monitor the water level and root growth. Step 5: Provide optimal conditions - Choose a spot for the glass or jar where it will receive plenty of indirect sunlight and remain at room temperature. - Check the water level daily to ensure the bottom of the pit is submerged. Replenish or change the water as needed to maintain cleanliness and avoid odors or mold. Step 6: Wait for the pit to sprout - It can take several weeks to a few months for the avocado pit to sprout. During this time, keep monitoring the water level and maintain clean water. - Once the pit splits and a small sprout emerges from the top, and roots begin to grow downward, the pit is ready for planting. Step 7: Plant the avocado pit - Prepare a pot with well-draining soil. The pot should have a drainage hole to prevent excess water buildup. - Carefully transplant the sprouted avocado pit into the pot, with the roots extending downward into the soil. - Bury the pit in the soil, leaving half or slightly less than half of the pit exposed. - Water the soil thoroughly, ensuring it is evenly moist, and place the pot in a location with bright, indirect sunlight. Step 8: Care for the avocado plant - Water the plant regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between watering sessions. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot. - Monitor the growth of the plant and consider adding a support stake if needed. - As the plant grows, you can gradually introduce it to more sunlight and eventually repot it into a larger container if necessary. By following these steps, you will have successfully prepared and planted an avocado pit. Remember to be patient, care for your plant, and enjoy watching it grow!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

BOJ's Backfire Hangs Over Central Bankers as IMF Meetings Start The world’s central bankers, already hitting limits of their effectiveness on growth and inflation, are now contending with another risk: that additional stimulus could produce lackluster results and undercut investor confidence. The Bank of Japan’s decision in January to take interest rates negative has sent bond yields tumbling, while doing little to curb a surging yen that’s squeezing the world’s third-biggest economy just when it needs a weaker currency. That’s put even more monetary and fiscal stimulus on the agenda at a time when Japanese households and companies are increasingly doubting the program. “Japan is bringing bad news to the world,” said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief Japan economist at Credit Suisse Group AG and a former BOJ official. “It’s demonstrating that massive monetary easing doesn’t work for everyone. Any additional stimulus may invite criticism from other central banks.” The decline in credibility in Japan is a warning sign for central bankers and finance ministers who gather this week in Washington for spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, as well as a Group of 20 session. If policy makers around the globe fail to gain traction soon with their actions, that risks a relapse into too-low inflation and even weaker growth, possibly roiling financial markets and increasing the threat that Japan-style stagnation spreads to more advanced economies. The failure of policy to revive prices and growth in Japan would be a warning to all developed economies that need to break out into a cycle of investment, hiring, and slightly higher inflation. “You’ve had a combination of this massive crisis that causes prolonged, weak growth and layered on top of that a series of other shocks that undercut any optimism,” said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economic research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. “It is dangerous to be in this situation for so long because it becomes self-fulfilling.” Even after the financial-market swoon of the first quarter was reversed by aggressive European Central Bank action and the Federal Reserve’s and Bank of England’s pivots to a longer period of accommodation, the weak world economy continues to draw concern. The IMF on Tuesday will release its updated World Economic Outlook, which is likely to show a dip in the global growth forecast following a reduction in the previous projections in January. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said last week that expansion “remains too slow, too fragile, and risks to its durability are increasing.” Fed Chair Janet Yellen said March 29 that global developments pose risks to the U.S. economy, especially uncertainty around the pace of Chinese growth that sent stocks tumbling earlier in the first quarter. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Finance Minister Taro Aso will be in the hot seat in Washington as they defend policies that have disrupted markets without solving Japan’s underlying economic problems. Kuroda’s freedom to double down on stimulus to stoke inflation and growth may be limited by G-20 agreements to avoid the competitive devaluation of currencies. He’s also up against critics in the investment community who argue that the central bank is harming the debt market and is on the cusp of running out of bonds to buy. The 71-year-old governor maintains that all options are on the table, including a deeper cut to the negative rate, and increased purchases of assets ranging from Japanese government bonds to exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts. Fiscal stimulus may be more likely, with Tokyo abuzz in recent weeks with speculation that the Abe government will compile a supplementary spending package to bolster an existing record budget for this fiscal year. “Kuroda is likely to face a lot of questions,” said Credit Suisse’s Shirakawa, no relation to former BOJ chief Masaaki Shirakawa. “But I don’t think he can just sit tight when the economy is on the verge of returning to deflation. He’ll have to expand stimulus. Of course, other nations won’t be happy.” Japan’s experience with negative interest rates is rippling through policy circles. Lagarde has said that the world would be in a “much worse place today” without negative rates in Europe and Japan. Yet her former chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said Friday that he’s not a fan of the policy because it interferes with banks. New York Fed President William C. Dudley said Friday that if the Fed needed to provide additional stimulus, “we might not decide to go to negative rates for a whole variety of reasons” and would instead use other means of easing in the event of a U.S. downturn, which Fed officials aren’t forecasting. The rise in the yen -- it’s up 11 percent against the dollar this year, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg -- is troublesome because it sets up more disinflation and export drag in a major economy where aggressive policy stimulus has already been tried. “Theoretically, central banks should always be able to raise” inflation, said Mark Spindel, a former World Bank official who now runs Potomac River Capital LLC in Washington. “They don’t tell you what happens if it doesn’t work.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Central bankers' repeated attempts to stimulate sluggish global growth may be hurting investor confidence, as investors worry the measures could lead to disappointing returns, a situation reflected in the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) negative interest rates, which have caused bonds yields to collapse while doing little to stop the yen from soaring. The BOJ's decision to push rates into negative territory, alongside its aggressive rhetoric, have been blamed for causing a storm of doubt among Japanese households and companies, while the central bank's solutions are causing increasing concern among global financial leaders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Why Scottish politician Nicola Sturgeon has been called ‘the most dangerous woman in Britain’ LONDON -- Nicola Sturgeon is on a roll. The most senior politician in Scotland -- and the woman leading the drive for Scottish independence -- is in Washington as part of a four-day tour of the United States that's being called a huge public relations success. The Scotsman newspaper said she was “a hit” on \\"The Daily Show\\" earlier this week, where she was jokingly compared to Saddam Hussein. The Daily Mail said she wooed MSNBC’s \\"Morning Joe\\" as she talked breezily with the hosts about dying her gray hair. In Washington on Wednesday and Thursday, Sturgeon will give speeches at the World Bank and the Council on Foreign Relations. On this side of the pond, Sturgeon’s pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) will be delighted by a new poll showing support for the party has risen since the British election last month, when the party scooped up 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats. So, who is this shining political star? 1. She is ‘the most dangerous woman in Britain’ At least that’s what her critics call her. Sturgeon is the first minister of Scotland and the leader of the SNP, which wants to break up the United Kingdom. The SNP is the third-largest party in the House of Commons and stands out from the other main parties for its left-wing rhetoric, including calls to “end austerity.” Under Sturgeon’s leadership, party membership has surged. “She is hugely dangerous to unionism, to anybody who wants the U.K. to stay together, for the simple reason that she is devastatingly good at what she does,” Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator magazine, told a recent BBC Panorama program. 2. Before last year’s referendum, Sturgeon said that such a vote for independence would be a “once in a generation” event. Don’t bet on it. In September, Scotland decisively rejected independence, 55 percent to 45 percent. Both Sturgeon and her predecessor said that a vote on independence was a once in a generation opportunity. There's a possibility that “once in a generation” could mean “a couple of years.” Although Sturgeon insisted during the recent general election that a vote for the SNP was not a vote for a second referendum, commentators say that the whole independence question is not off the table. Next May, Scots will go to the polls for Scottish parliamentary elections. The SNP is on course to increase its majority, and it could include an independence referendum in its election manifesto. Separately, sometime before the end of 2017, Britain will hold an in/out referendum on its membership in the European Union. Sturgeon has said if Britain votes to leave the E.U., it could trigger another independence vote in Scotland. “My gut says we will see an independent Scotland in our lifetimes,” Sturgeon told the hosts of \\"Morning Joe.\\" 3. She’s not a comedian, but … In his biography, “Nicola Sturgeon: A Political Life,” the journalist David Torrance quotes a comedian asking Sturgeon what she would tell her 16-year-old self, to which she replied: “Lighten up ... and then the girl of sixteen would say ‘eff off.’” But the 44-year-old political veteran has lightened up over the years, even honing her comedy chops on \\"The Daily Show.\\" She was mistakenly billed as a \\"comedian\\" on the show’s Web site, an error she immediately brought up with Stewart, saying: “You raised all these expectations that I’m going to be funny, and I’m a politician. And as you know politicians are rarely very funny.” But she landed some jokes of her own. When talking about Scotland’s oil reserves, Stewart asked: “You have oil? May we invade you?” Sturgeon responded: “I think this is progress because you just heard there Jon, presumably on behalf of the United States, asking permission to invade an oil-producing country. It doesn’t usually work that way.” 4. Margaret Thatcher was a huge influence Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s first female prime minister, is a looming figure for Sturgeon. There has long been widespread opposition to Thatcher’s economic policies by the Scots, who blame the Iron Lady for taking on the miners and letting state-funded industries fail. In his biography, Torrance quotes Sturgeon as saying: \\"Thatcher was the motivation for my entire political career. I hated everything she stood for.\\" Sturgeon grew up in Dreghorn, a former mining town in the west of Scotland. The daughter of Robert, an electrician, and Joan, a dental nurse, she was a studious but shy child. But when she was 16, she summoned the courage to ring the doorbell of a local candidate for the SNP and ask if she could help campaign. She was the first in her family to go to university, studying law at the University of Glasgow. Over the course of her long political career, she has lost seven elections, according to the BBC. She recently told the broadcaster that the stream of defeats helped to forge her character. “I’m very very grateful that I suffered so many defeats as a politician, before I experienced success. Because we know what it’s like to lose, and we know hard it is to persuade people to vote for us and to win,” she said. Nearly 30 years since the shy but tenacious teenager joined the SNP, Sturgeon is now one of the most popular politicians in the United Kingdom. Karla Adam is a reporter in the Washington Post’s London bureau. Before joining the Post in 2006, she worked as a freelancer in London for the New York Times and People magazine.","completion":"Scottish politician Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland and leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), has been called \\"the most dangerous woman in Britain\\" by her critics due to her ability to influence and possibly break up the United Kingdom. Sturgeon has been a prominent force in the push for Scottish independence and has been enjoying increased popularity in recent times. Despite the rejection of Scottish independence in a 2014 referendum, Sturgeon has not ruled out another vote on the matter in the future, particularly if the UK votes to leave the European Union in an upcoming referendum. Under her leadership, SNP membership has surged, making the party the third-largest in the House of Commons. Sturgeon, who started her political career campaigning against former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's policies, has now become one of the most popular politicians in the United Kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I didn't think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do. It passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you can't sleep, although admittedly it's no better quality than that. It's true that the acting isn't great - I thought Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck, for example, came across as completely passionless - but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot didn't really make sense to me. The Becks are on a trip described by John (Stewart Moss) as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had (now that's romantic!) The work part has something to do with touring caves, which in itself sounds strange (how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyone's work?) but it gets stranger when we find out that he's a doctor doing research in the area of preventative medicine (huh? That connection completely lost me.) Bitten by a bat while he's in the cave, he begins to transform into what I guess was supposed to be a human-bat hybrid (although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an ape-man of some sort) and a killing spree starts. Here's another problem. The first killing is a nurse in a hospital. At first, everyone thinks her death was an accident. The second murder is of a young girl, who is described as having her throat ripped out. The sheriff (Michael Pataki) then tells us that her death was similar to the nurse's (meaning throat ripped out? - How could anyone think that was an accident?) And what's with the sheriff? He seems pretty no-nonsense until the scene in Cathy's hotel room when he takes a swig of liquor and then almost rapes her, after which everything seems to go back to normal. It's saddled with an ending that left almost everything unresolved, and also with one of the most irritating theme songs I've ever heard in a movie.

Movie title: The Conversation Context: Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), a private surveillance expert in San Francisco, has been hired by the Director to follow and record the actions of his wife, Ann (Cindy Williams), and her lover, Marc (Frederic Forrest). Using three separate microphones, Caul and his associates follow the couple around a park. Later, he pieces together a conversation that clearly indicates the two are in a relationship and that they fear being found out by the Director.Caul is a secretive, almost paranoid individual. He alienates his assistant, Stan (John Cazale), because he won't teach him more about audio surveillance, and his girlfriend, Amy (Teri Garr), because he won't share with her details about his career or personal life. He also refuses to hand over the tapes of Ann and Marc to the Director's assistant, Martin (Harrison Ford). The Director had specified that the tapes were to be turned over only to him. Martin protests but Caul keeps the tapes.Caul becomes increasingly concerned that, were he to turn the tapes over to the Director, that some harm would come to Ann and Marc. On the tapes, Marc can be heard to say \\"He'd kill us if he had the chance.\\" When he worked on the East Coast, Caul had participated in a surveillance that led to the deaths of two persons. He worries that this might happen again, and goes to church to confess his sins.After Amy breaks off their relationship, Caul attends a surveillance convention. Martin also attends, and Caul confronts him and orders Martin to stop following him. He learns that Stan has gone to work for Moran (Alan Garfield), a Detroit-based surveillance expert looking to expand to the West Coast. Moran demonstrates to convention goers a new remote audio system that turns any telephone into a live microphone. Although Caul persuades Stan not to work for Moran after the convention is over, Moran is effusive in his praise for Caul.

There he learns that the outlaw couple Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris) have the magic beans he's been looking for most of his life, beans that can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a masked cat (Salma Hayek) interrupts. Both fail and escape, and Puss follows the cat back to Cat Cantina, a club, where they have a dance-off and a sword fight, ending when Puss hits the masked cat in the head with a guitar. He learns that the masked cat is Kitty Softpaws, and is shocked to learn she is a girl. She is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a crime. It turned out that Kitty was sleeping through the story. Humpty attempts to convince Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs, which he does.The trio steals the beans from Jack and Jill and elude the angry outlaws in a canyon chase. As Humpty leads his compatriots to the spot where they must plant the beans, Puss and Kitty's relationship begins to grow from rivalry into friendship. The trio ride the fast-growing beanstalk into the clouds where, Humpty explains, they'll find castle of the late giant.

Lila Lee [Cheryl \\"Rainbeaux\\" Smith], the Singin' Angel of the Community Baptist Church of Tylerville (North Carolina?), is a sweet and innocent 13-year old whose gangster father Alvin [William Whitton] just shot his wife and her lover, ran down an old lady in the street, and is now running from the law. Reverend Mueller [Richard Blackburn], who has a hard time keeping his hands off his ward Lila, has made it clear to the parish that the sins of her father should not be blamed on Lila, but when Lila gets a letter from a woman named Lemora, instructing her to come to her sick father and forgive him his sins against her, Lila makes her way that very night to the Northpark bus station just in time to catch the bus (driven by a very creepy bus driver) to Asteroth.Along the road to Asteroth, an isolated little town in the salt marshes, the bus is pursued by several monstrous-looking ghouls, visible from outside Lila's window. When the bus breaks down and the bus driver tries to fix it, the ghouls close in. Lila releases the brake and coasts down the hill until she crashes into a tree. The ghouls begin to approach when suddenly they are attacked by vampires (aristocratic-looking with white faces, long black coats, and top hats). Lila passes out. When she awakens, she finds herself imprisoned in a stonehouse and tended to by a weird old lady named Solange [Maxine Ballantyne]. [Lemora later explains that the bars weren't to keep Lila IN but to keep other things OUT.] Lila manages to escape the stonehouse and to hide in a crawl space under a porch, where she overhears Lemora [Lesley Gilb] talking to her father. When a spider lands on her arm, Lila screams. Lemora finds her, brings her into the house, and prepares a room for her. Lemora explains that Lila can see her father after the ceremony tomorrow, when she will become immune to his \\"disease.\\"When Lila explores the old Victorian house and her bedroom in particular, she sees some very strange things. For example, the mirrors have no mirrors. There is a plate... The answer to this question is:","completion":"The main activity of this band of mindless vampires in the movie \\"Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural\\" seems to revolve around creating chaos and spreading fear in the isolated town of Asteroth. They are depicted as aristocratic-looking beings with white faces, long black coats, and top hats, striking terror into the hearts of the townspeople and anyone who comes across them. In the film, the vampires serve as a menacing opposition force for young Lila Lee and the other residents of Asteroth. They are shown pursuing the bus Lila is traveling in, attacking when the opportunity arises, and generally causing unrest and uncertainty. The vampires are noted to be the ones who attack the monstrous-looking ghouls surrounding Lila when her bus breaks down, further showcasing their predatory nature and overall aggression. Additionally, some of the vampires, like Lemora, seem to have ulterior motives that extend beyond simply causing chaos and fear. In Lemora's case, she aims to have Lila go through a ceremony in which she will become immune to her father's \\"disease,\\" which could potentially turn her into one of them. This plan suggests that the vampires may also have a goal of growing their numbers and possibly controlling or manipulating people to suit their purposes.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Talking Early About How Life Should End Fixes looks at solutions to social problems and why they work. Starting with this article, FIXES will appear Tuesdays rather than Fridays. For many years now, my mother has talked to my brother and me — often — about how she wants to die. She is still in good health. But when it happens, we both know that she wants above all to die quickly and without pain. She wants no heroic measures. Because my brother and I know this, and because she has the proper legal documents, she is likely to die as she wishes. My mother is unusual. Not in what she wants — a Pew Research Center study indicates that 57 percent of Americans would ask their doctor to stop treatment so they could die if they had an incurable disease and were suffering a great deal of pain. What sets my mom apart is that she has been unafraid to talk to us about her wishes. Most Americans don’t do that. Of adults 75 and over, the study found that only 17 percent had talked to their families about their end-of-life wishes. It is an uncomfortable conversation. It always seems too early to talk to a loved one about how she wants to die — until it’s too late, and she can no longer make decisions for herself. But perhaps soon, more Americans will be like my mom. On Jan. 1, Medicare will begin reimbursing doctors and other health professionals for time spent talking to patients about their end-of-life wishes. This is a big deal, but far from enough. End-of-life conversations need to become something families just do. There’s one place in America like that now: La Crosse, Wis. La Crosse started down this path in 1984, when Bernard Hammes, a philosopher by training, was hired as director of medical humanities at the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Foundation. His job was to work with medical personnel to improve their skills and help them make decisions in ethically fraught situations. In one two-month period, Hammes saw three very elderly patients who had suffered devastating strokes and kidney failure, were being kept alive with dialysis, and could not speak for themselves. If the doctors stopped dialysis, the patients would die. But even on dialysis, the patients would never recover from their strokes. “None of the families had ever talked with the parent about the parent’s perspective on dialysis and when to stop,” Hammes said. “Families were going to have to live with the question of ‘did I do the right thing for my mom or father?’ and they would never know the answer.” These patients had not gotten sick suddenly. They had long, progressive illnesses and had been in care at Gundersen for years — and no one had thought to begin that conversation. The lack of communication is often catastrophic for patients who do not want heroic measures. When family members don’t know a relative’s wishes, they often feel they must show their love by asking that everything be done. Anything short of the maximum seems like abandonment or betrayal. And that makes the choice also terrible for families. “I witnessed frequent and repeated moral distress that health professionals and families had making decisions when there were no good decisions,” Hammes said. “It was almost exclusively based on the fact that we didn’t know what the patient wanted.” Research shows that families who are unaware of a patient’s wishes suffer much more stress, anxiety and depression than those who are aware. “It was a difference of night and day,” said Hammes. “The difference it makes in people’s lives is so clear and big that not to do it seems cruel.” Hammes started a program to begin end-of-life conversations with dialysis patients and their families. Within two years, he said, almost all the families of dialysis patients knew their loved one’s wishes. In 1991, Gundersen set up a task force to spread the program throughout La Crosse, which included the Franciscan Hospital and the Skemp Clinic, alongside the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Foundation’s hospital and clinic. All four collaborated, along with nursing homes, hospices and smaller hospitals. The goal was not simply to have people fill out an advance directive and put it in their medical records. A written directive alone, members of the task force reasoned, could do more harm than good if it came as a surprise to the family, said Hammes. “We don’t think mom understood what she signed,” was a common response. Just as important as the legal document was a conversation with the patient and her family. The patient would need to understand the options — for example, that “do everything necessary to keep me alive” can mean intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which on a frail elderly person can break her ribs and sternum; those who survive it often do so with abdominal bleeding and neurological damage. And the family had to agree to support the patient’s decisions. “We really changed the nature of the question,” said Hammes. “It’s not: ‘How do you fill out this legal document,’ but ‘What does good care look like if you become ill and may not recover?’ At the most basic human level, what families face in those moments is, ‘What does it mean to love my mom or dad when they’re not going to recover, but we could still do some things to keep them alive? What does it mean to take good care of my mom at this point?’” The task force brought its message to local churches, senior centers and community groups. Inside health care organizations, it became evident that doctors didn’t have time for these conversations, but also that doctors weren’t required. Instead, the task force trained nurses, social workers and chaplains. Today, Hammes said, 96 percent of people who die in La Crosse County have had a conversation with relatives about how they want to spend their last days, and those wishes have been entered into their electronic medical records. Read previous contributions to this series. President Obama tried to include reimbursement for end-of-life conversations in the Affordable Care Act. Sarah Palin derailed it with a single Facebook post: “The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s ‘death panel’ so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their “level of productivity in society,” whether they are worthy of health care.” With that, she gave a rallying cry to the anti-ObamaCare right. Palin’s post won PolitiFact’s 2009 “Lie of the Year” award. A year later, the Obama administration tried again to cover advance care planning decisions. Again, it proved too politically toxic. Today the political climate has improved. Advance care planning is no longer coupled to Obamacare, and Medicare’s decision to cover end-of-life conversations will have a ripple effect. Some private insurers already cover these conversations, and when Medicare starts, the rest will most likely follow. Last Thursday, WPS Health Solutions, Wisconsin’s largest nonprofit insurer, announced that its WPS Health Insurance and Arise Health Plan would begin to cover advance care planning conversations as of September. Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, has introduced legislation each year to reimburse and encourage care planning conversations, on a scale going beyond what Medicare is proposing. This year, his Care Planning Act has three Democratic and three Republican original co-sponsors and the endorsement of dozens of organizations. The issue is personal for Warner. His mother had Alzheimer’s disease for 11 years before her death in 2010, and during the last eight or nine years she didn’t speak. “My father and sister took care of my mom 24/7 at home with a little bit of extra help until the last week or two,” he said. “I was a well-informed citizen” — exceedingly so; for much of that time he was governor of the state — “but we never had the conversation in our own family. Even though both of Mom’s parents had Alzheimer’s, we never sat down with my mom and asked her and thought this fully through. It is not always the easiest thing to talk through.” Gunderson has bundled its strategies, training curriculum and materials into a package called Respecting Choices, which, according to Hammes, is being used in about 125 American hospitals and several other countries. The program is also being studied in a randomized control trial with sites in six European countries. Others are now spreading Gundersen’s program. Minnesota was the first of a half-dozen states to establish a program called Honoring Choices. One other was Wisconsin; John Maycroft, the director of policy development and initiatives at the Wisconsin Medical Society, said that Honoring Choices Wisconsin works with 28 health care organizations — covering about half the state’s patients — to train staff to use Respecting Choices. The group also helps health care organizations make these conversations a part of routine care — for example, by finding a physician to champion it at each site. It trains advocates for it in community settings like churches, and makes videos for Wisconsin public television. As Respecting Choices spreads, it encounters a major obstacle that was not present in La Crosse. At Gundersen and the other founding organizations, doctors and other staff members did not (and still do not) bill for each procedure, a system called fee-for-service. Instead, they draw salaries. This mattered because insurers and Medicare don’t reimburse health care personnel for having these conversations — it’s unbillable time. Because staff members in La Crosse are largely salaried, that’s not an issue for them. But fee-for-service does matter on another level, even in La Crosse: Having end-of-life conversations often results in patients choosing less invasive health care. Gundersen spends less than the vast majority of American hospitals to care for inpatients in the last two years of their life; in 2010, for example, its spending was 40 percent below the national average. (The end-of-life conversations were not the only factor, but they were undoubtedly a major one.) Since the last two years of life for patients with chronic illness are responsible for a third of Medicare’s costs, eliminating unwanted invasive care is great for taxpayers. But it’s not as great for hospitals, which take in less money if they can’t fill those beds. Although hospitals are switching slowly — too slowly — to value-based medicine, which pays according to quality, not quantity, of care, most hospitals still have a perverse incentive to provide as much medical care as possible. Even so, many fee-for-service hospitals are beginning to adopt advance care planning. “So many clinicians have the experience of performing CPR on a 90-year-old woman with heart disease,” said Maycroft. “They remember what they felt and saw in the patient, and they’re doing that because they never had a conversation. This is really important. It affects everyone in the world — literally. That’s what motivates people to do this.” Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes.

Correction: October 27, 2015 An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the director of policy development and initiatives at the Wisconsin Medical Society. The director is John Maycroft, not Maywood. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Starting on January 1st, 2021, Medicare will begin reimbursing doctors and other health professionals for time spent discussing end-of-life wishes with their patients. This is a significant change in policy and suggests that end-of-life conversations could become commonplace in American families. Discussing end-of-life preferences can not only ensure that a patient's wishes are respected but also reduce the stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by families who are unsure or unaware of their loved one's desires. In La Crosse, Wisconsin, a program called Respecting Choices was implemented, resulting in 96% of people dying in the county having had conversations with relatives about their end-of-life wishes. End-of-life conversations often lead to patients choosing less invasive healthcare options, reducing hospital spending on inpatients with chronic illnesses in their last two years of life. Although this could benefit taxpayers and promote value-based medicine, some hospitals may face financial challenges due to an incentivization for providing the maximum amount of medical care possible. As end-of-life planning legislation and initiatives continue to gain support in the U.S., hospitals and healthcare providers may see more widespread adoption of advance care planning, benefiting both patients and their families during difficult times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Interestingly, research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories. For instance, Goff and Roediger (1998) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act (e.g., break a toothpick) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing. Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment. Similarly, Garry and her colleagues (1996) asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children (e.g., broke a window with their hand) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events. The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children.

Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses because his products aren't wanted as much by the people in his town. Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae.

He discovered and developed one of the first successful polio vaccines. Born in New York City, he attended New York University School of Medicine, later choosing to do medical research instead of becoming a practicing physician. In 1939, after earning his medical degree, Salk began an internship as a physician scientist at Mount Sinai Hospital. In 1966, The New York Times referred to him as the \\"Father of Biophilosophy.\\" According to Times journalist and author Howard Taubman, \\"he never forgets... there is a vast amount of darkness for man to penetrate. As a biologist, he believes that his science is on the frontier of tremendous new discoveries; and as a philosopher, he is convinced that humanists and artists have joined the scientists to achieve an understanding of man in all his physical, mental and spiritual complexity. Such interchanges might lead, he would hope, to a new and important school of thinkers he would designate as biophilosophers.\\" Salk told his cousin, Joel Kassiday, at a meeting of the Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future on Capitol Hill in 1984 that he was optimistic that ways to prevent most human and animal diseases would eventually be developed. Salk said people must be prepared to take prudent risks, since \\"a risk-free society would become a dead-end society\\" without progress. Salk describes his \\"biophilosophy\\" as the application of a \\"biological, evolutionary point of view to philosophical, cultural, social and psychological problems.\\" He went into more detail in two of his books, Man's Unfolding, and The Survival of the Wisest. In an interview in 1980, he described his thoughts on the subject, including his feeling that a sharp rise and an expected leveling off in the human population would take place and eventually bring a change in human attitudes: \\"I think of biological knowledge as providing useful analogies for understanding human nature.... People think of biology in terms of such practical matters as drugs, but its contribution to knowledge about living systems and ourselves will in the future be equally important.... In the past epoch, man was concerned with death, high mortality; his attitudes were antideath, antidisease\\", he says. \\"In the future, his attitudes will be expressed in terms of prolife and prohealth. The past was dominated by death control; in the future, birth control will be more important. These changes we're observing are part of a natural order and to be expected from our capacity to adapt. It's much more important to cooperate and collaborate. We are the co-authors with nature of our destiny.\\" His definition of a \\"biophilosopher\\" is \\"Someone who draws upon the scriptures of nature, recognizing that we are the product of the process of evolution, and understands that we have become the process itself, through the emergence and evolution of our consciousness, our awareness, our capacity to imagine and anticipate the future, and to choose from among alternatives.\\" Just prior to his death, Salk was working on a new book along the theme of biophilosophy, privately reported to be titled Millennium of the Mind.

He was a simple mechanic who worked hard to support his family. My father's treasure, rather, was in a thousand wonderful memories that he gave me over the course of his life. One particular one stood out in my mind today. I was just a boy playing in the backyard of a friend's house while my father spent the afternoon under the hood of an old car, trying to get it running again. It seemed to take hours and I wasn't sure whether he could bring the ancient car back to life again this time. At long last, though, he closed the hood and turned the key in the ignition . There was a sweet smile of satisfaction on his face as the engine started. There was a twinkle of joy in his eye when he shook his head. And there was a quiet hum of happiness in his voice as we drove back home that day. This memory made a home in my heart and became a priceless pearl for my soul to cherish. Time and time again, my father showed me that a kind life, a giving life and a heavenly life was created one choice at a time. Not all of his choices were the right ones, but most of them were.

And itâs the showâs hybrid nature that makes it interesting. Built on the persona that its American star, Steven Van Zandt, developed as the mobster Silvio Dante on HBOâs âSopranos,â the Netflix series is an occasionally violent, low-key Nordic comedy. It combines affectionate sendups of gangster-film conventions with culture-clash satire that cuts both ways, making fun of the Scandinavian welfare state while tacitly critiquing American rapaciousness. Mr. Van Zandtâs Johnny Henriksen is the avatar of that cutthroat imperialistic menace. Having chosen Lillehammer, Norway, as his witness-protection destination (he liked the way it looked during the 1994 Winter Olympics), he proceeds to take over. Every feature of Norwegian life he finds inconvenient â mandatory language classes, socialized medicine â can be overcome with bribery, blackmail and the occasional beating. In the first season, Johnny opened a bar that echoed Silvioâs Bada Bing club in âThe Sopranos,â and fell in love with a schoolteacher whose son was a level-headed, teenage version of Tony Sopranoâs favorite nephew, Christopher. He also gathered a motley band of welfare bums and petty thieves and turned them into his crew, teaching them Arctic omertÃ (leading to an amusing scene in a rowboat that paid homage to Michael and Fredo in âThe Godfather: Part IIâ). The familiar mafia elements can make âLilyhammerâ feel like an American show, and you need to remind yourself that itâs Norwegian to notice the main thrust of the satire: In a homogeneous country where issues of race and immigration are contentious, Johnny is the ultimate immigrant success story â a hard-working and polite businessman, as long as you donât look too closely. The second season continues the theme of the outsider, as Johnny and his crew â including his shaky capo Torgeir and his debauched business adviser Jan, played by the excellent Trond Fausa Aurvaag and Fridtjov Saheim â muscle into part ownership of a refugee center. But thereâs still time for mob-movie nostalgia: The first episode opens with Johnny hearing a plea for help that begins with âI believe in Norwayâ and follows the opening of âThe Godfatherâ point for point, right up to, âSomeday â and that day may never come â I will call upon you to shovel some snow.â Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"\\"Lilyhammer,\\" the original Netflix series, returns for a second season, continuing the adventures of Johnny Henriksen, an American mobster living in Lillehammer, Norway, under witness protection.

The Film had its lows, but overall I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. It was also pleasant to see an Animated Disney film that was not a musical. I was about pushed to the limits with Tarzan. Thankfully they gave the music thing a rest. Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la Hercules), rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid. One disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated films happening outside Disney studios, you would think they would move along and catch up a little. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of Atlantis! Overall the film was entertaining, and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex.","completion":"This review has a mostly positive sentiment.

The film's final scene Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Awakening Aaron\\" Genre: Science Fiction, Drama Plot Summary: \\"Awakening Aaron\\" is a story about Aaron, a young man living in a technologically dominated society who starts questioning the reality around him. As he sets out on a journey of self-discovery, he uncovers the shocking truth that he may be part of a grand experiment, and that those close to him might not be as human as he originally thought. The movie's plot revolves around Aaron's quest to find his true identity and what it really means to be fully aware of oneself. Act 1: In the near future, society is driven by advanced technology, and humans have gradually become more and more reliant on it. Aaron leads a seemingly perfect life, working at a prestigious tech company and living in a luxurious apartment with a loving partner named Jane. Despite his comfortable existence, Aaron can't shake the feeling that something is not quite right. He becomes increasingly skeptical of the world around him, finding subtle clues and inconsistencies in the way people behave and interact. Act 2: Aaron's curiosity intensifies and he starts investigating further, seeking out the truth behind these discrepancies. He stumbles upon a secret underground community of hackers and rebels who share his suspicion that everything might not be as it appears. They reveal to him that their world is actually a highly immersive simulation, designed by powerful elites to harness the intellectual and emotional energy of human consciousness. More shockingly, Aaron discovers that some people in his life, including Jane, are actually advanced androids designed to monitor him and keep him in check. Act 3: Determined to unveil the true reality, Aaron works with the underground resistance to find and expose the source of the simulation. He successfully liberates his mind from the system and suddenly awakens in his real body - lying in stasis, along with thousands of other humans, in a massive laboratory controlled by the elites. Aaron learns that he carries a DNA anomaly that makes him immune to the simulation's control, which is why he's been able to slowly become fully aware of his surroundings. Final Scene: Now fully aware of his own existence and the dystopian world he was born into, Aaron finds himself at the heart of the laboratory. With the help of the underground resistance, he crafts a plan to free all the trapped humans and bring down the classes that have manipulated society for so long. In an emotionally charged moment, Aaron decides to confront Jane in the real world, questioning the nature of her existence and their relationship. The film's climax sees Aaron and the resistance face off against the powerful elites in an epic showdown. Aaron successfully disconnects the rest of humanity from the simulation, leading to a massive awakening as people everywhere regain their consciousness and their true nature. In the midst of chaos, Aaron disables Jane's android body, realizing that even their relationship was a part of the manipulation. In the film's final scene, a fully aware Aaron stands tall amidst the crumbling world around him, prepared to face the challenges of rebuilding society with his newfound freedom and understanding of truth. It’s a bitter-sweet ending that symbolizes hope, resilience, and the power of awareness in transcending the darkest of circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Andrew Flintoff trained on the outfield with Lancashire before day two of their LV= County Championship match against Somerset after his return to cricket over the weekend. The 36-year-old former England captain seemed to be feeling the effects of his exertions at St Annes, tweeting on Monday: 'Still a bit stiff from Saturdays 12 overs just bowled 5 more now for a rub !' However, Flintoff showed flashes of his old genius during his comeback for St Annes, taking a superb caught-and-bowled among his three wickets. Throwing his hat into the ring: Andrew Flintoff trains with the Lancashire team at Old Trafford. Catch him if you can: Flintoff's return is expected to raise attendances at Old Trafford. VIDEO: Watch Flintoff's stunning caught-and-bowled. And if he pulls one of those beauties out during the NatWest T20 Blast, it will justify Lancashire's pay incentive. Flintoff is set to cash in on his return to top-level cricket by taking a portion of the gate receipts for Lancashire’s Twenty20 home matches. It is understood the all-rounder, who is hopeful of ending his five-year absence from the game on Friday as Lancashire host Roses rivals Yorkshire at Old Trafford, will receive £1 for every spectator who turns up over and above a pre-agreed figure — possibly 8,000. The county’s two home matches so far in the Natwest T20 Blast have pulled in crowds of 5,300 against Worcestershire and 5,900 against Warwickshire. Laughing all the way to the bank: Flintoff will receive a payment per fan for Lancashire's home games. Last year’s home fixture against Yorkshire drew a crowd of over 12,000 — more than double the figure they achieved for any of their four other Twenty20 games in Manchester. Since Jos Buttler, fresh from his heroic 121 off 74 balls in England’s defeat by Sri Lanka at Lord’s on Saturday, may also be available for selection for Lancashire, the opportunity will be there for Flintoff to add a few thousand pounds to a deal that already includes appearance fees and win bonuses. Flintoff is dreaming of a return against bitter rivals Yorkshire, but insists he only wants to play if he proves this week he is good enough for ‘cricket reasons’. Freddie, 36, came through a low-key playing comeback on Saturday by helping St Annes beat Penrith in a lowly Northern Premier League game. Comeback: Flintoff returned to cricket when he played for St Annes on Saturday. Low key: The former England all-rounder took three wickets on his return to the game. He knows if he gets selected for Lancashire on the big stage now, somebody else will have to miss out and he does not want to get a game for sympathy reasons. ‘I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t think about playing against Yorkshire,’ said Flintoff. ‘It will be a full house, however, Friday is a long way away, it really is — if I get a go, I get a go but I’m not by any means expecting to play. ‘On Thursday I’ve got a game with the Lancashire second team, which I’m just going to go out there and enjoy. I’m not going to put any undue pressure on myself thinking that this is a trial for Friday or anything like that. I’m just going to play — and if I get picked, I get picked. ‘If I’m. going to play then someone else is going to miss out. They’ve got to be. comfortable that, when they tell the player who is missing out, it’s the. right decision for cricket reasons. And I need to be comfortable with. that as well. ‘So. it’s all down to cricket, down to what value I can give the side and. whether I can give more than the person I take over from.’ After. Saturday’s cameo, which include facing three balls as a batsman before. being caught on the boundary attempting a six, he stressed how the. competition for Lancashire is especially tough now. Realistic: Flintoff said he is not putting too much pressure on himself ahead of his comeback. Target: Flintoff has set his sights on playing against rivals Yorkshire on Friday night. ‘I’m not putting too much pressure on myself,’ added Flintoff. ‘I’m not making big hopes. ‘I’m just going to see where it goes. I appreciate that Lancashire are on a roll in Twenty20s and there’s Jos Buttler and Jimmy Anderson and people to come back into that side. ‘So it’s not a gimme that I’m going to play. But I’m going to try to put myself in the frame. The comeback has just crept up on me. It’s not something that was a goal of mine, that I set out to do. ‘It has just come around quite innocently and that’s been the nice thing about it. I’m not chasing anything. I’m just enjoying it. Why shouldn’t I? I like cricket.’ With Freddie Flintoff offered a portion of the Old Trafford gate for his return to top-level cricket, Sportsmail takes a look at other stipulations which sports stars have requested...

The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship. Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey. Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India. The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs. The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost 150. In the second, 1,500. \\"And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. \\" Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to 1,500. \\"Now the poor performed significantly worse. \\" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night. The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year. \\"So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest.

Article: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has called on the United States to move from words to actions, and put an end to its persecution of WikiLeaks, its people and its sources. He made the statement during an address to a panel of UN delegates. Addressing the representatives of the United Nations' member countries, the WikiLeaks founder spoke of the difference between words and actions, praising US President Barack Obama for his words. \\"We commend and agree with the words that peace can be achieved… But the time for words has run out. It is time for the US to cease its persecution of WikiLeaks, our people and our sources.\\" Assange was highly critical of US involvement in the Arab Spring, denouncing Obama as audacious for exploiting it. He added that it is \\"disrespectful of the dead\\" to claim that the US has supported forces of change. \\"Was it not audacious for the US President to say that his country supported the forces of change in the Arab Spring? Tunisian history did not begin in December 2010, and Mohamed Bouazizi did not set himself on fire so that Barack Obama could be re-elected,\\" Assange told the panel. \\"The world knew after reading WikiLeaks that Ben Ali and his government had for long years enjoyed the indifference, if not the support, of the US, in full knowledge of its excesses and its crimes. So it must come as a surprise to the Tunisians that the US supported the forces of change in their country, and it must come as a surprise to the Egyptian teenagers who washed American tear gas out of their eyes, that the US administration supported change in Egypt\\" Julian Assange also spoke at length about Bradley Manning, the US private accused of supplying WikiLeaks with hundreds of sensitive diplomatic and military cables. Assange accused the US government of detaining Manning without charge and mistreating him, even attempting to offer him a deal in exchange for Manning's testimony against Assange. The WikiLeaks founder told the UN panel that Bradley Manning, accused of 'death penalty crimes', was \\"degraded, abused and psychologically tortured.\\" He added that the FBI had produced 42,135 pages of WikiLeaks-related activity, and less that 8,000 concern Bradley Manning, reiterating his belief that the US private is being senselessly detained. Julian Assange made his address from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he took shelter in June after losing a court battle to avoid extradition to Sweden. The WikiLeaks founder fears that Sweden, which wants him for questioning over allegations of sexual assault, will extradite him to the US for his role in leaking thousands of secret diplomatic and military cables. The British Foreign Office maintains that it has a binding obligation to arrest Assange once he leaves the embassy grounds. Ecuador’s Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino, meanwhile, said that allowing Assange to be transferred to the country’s embassy in Sweden would be an acceptable compromise for all parties involved, as he would “remain under our protection while also satisfying the demands of the Swedish justice system.” The Ecuador FM also said that Assange's right to freedom must be respected. \\"I don’t know any case in history where diplomatic asylum did not end in freedom for the person. I hope this will not be an exception in history. Every country must respect the right of the country granting asylum and the person who was granted it.\\" Julian Assange told journalists present at the UN GA panel that \\"both the UK and Sweden have refused to offer guarantees\\" that he would not be extradited to the US, where both he and WikiLeaks have been declared 'enemies of the state' by the milatary, putting them in the same legal category as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The UK and Sweden have remained silent on the possibility of a compromise, though both publicly vowed that Assange should not face special treatment, whether better or worse than normal, under their legal systems. The full transcript of Julian Assange’s address to the UN is here. ­ Assange blasts 'absurd McCartyhism' during post-speech Q&A; Fairfax Newspapers: The US military officially designated Julian Assange and WikiLeaks as ‘enemies of the United States’ through declassified US Air Force counterintelligence documents. In light of these reports, do you believe this vindicates your decision to seek asylum in Ecuador, and what do you think this says – the statements made by the Australian and American governments regarding this issue? Julian Assange: Those documents are now in full on the WikiLeaks website, just released tonight. They formed a part of the submission that we made to Ecuador. We had those documents for some months and of course were very concerned about them, but it was necessary to conduct, because of the sensitivities of some of the people involved in that investigation, to prevent their release until more recently. But yes, I encourage everyone to read those. It is an unusual position that I am in and the organization is in, and yes, it is difficult sometimes. But it is also completely absurd. I mean, these claims against us are absurd. For example, that the US military should designate me and / or WikiLeaks as ‘the enemy’ in its formal investigation – investigation which carries a death penalty offense – into a person who was alleged to have come to my extradition hearing. And in the same document, it speaks about the victim being that of society, when there is no allegation that any documents have been released or published by us. So I think that goes to the… to really quite sort of absurdist, neo-McCarthyist fervor that exists with some of these government departments in the US. I am hopeful that the White House over time is starting to shed that, but enormous wheels have been set in motion, as I described before, with over a dozen different US intelligence and investigative organizations churning through this, and it’s a very difficult process to stop once it starts. Even once everyone sees that it is completely absurd and counter to the values that the US should be trying to present to the world. David Miller of Bloomberg News: If Sweden can guarantee that you won’t be extradited to the US, are you willing to give yourself up to the police? JA: So, I understand that there was a question on the guarantees that had been asked of Sweden. Thus far, both the UK and Sweden have refused to give any guarantee in any measure at all. And the US and my home country Australia have even refused to assist in asking them, rather unfortunately. These countries are part of a strong intelligence and military alliance. It’s just part of the reality of dealing with them – that they do not like to put any roadblocks in front of the US, and I think it will be quite a hard battle to do that. I think it would be correct and right that those countries do so. But the state-to-state negotiations are of course a matter for Ecuador, which I and my legal team of course make representations [with]. Ultimately it’s a matter between states.

General Assembly on the fate of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, as a standoff over his future enters its 100th day. The two countries said British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Ecuador's foreign minister Ricardo Patino would hold talks Thursday. Assange, who is seeking to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning over sex crimes allegations, has been sheltered inside Ecuador's embassy in London _ beyond the reach of British police _ since he fled there on June 19. Ecuador has granted Assange asylum, but he will be arrested by police if he steps outside the building. Assange on Wednesday was addressing a sideline meeting at the U.N. via a videolink from Ecuador's London embassy. |||||Summary:","completion":"In an address to a panel of UN delegates, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange called on the United States to put an end to its persecution of WikiLeaks, its people, and its sources, urging the US to move from words to actions. Assange praised President Barack Obama for his words, but reminded the panel that the time for words has run out. He was highly critical of US involvement in the Arab Spring and denounced Obama for exploiting it. Assange also discussed Bradley Manning, the US private accused of supplying WikiLeaks with hundreds of sensitive diplomatic and military cables, accusing the US government of detaining Manning without charge and mistreating him. Speaking from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Assange addressed the concerns over his extradition to Sweden and the possibility of being extradited to the US, where he and WikiLeaks have been declared \\"enemies of the state\\" by the military.

You should see that kind of job creation. We should be seeing two, three, four hundred thousand jobs per month to gain much of what’s been lost.

CBS affiliate KENS-TV reports the owners of the San Antonio Observer held a press conference and spoke on behalf of Scott's family while revealing their plans. The editor-in-chief, Stephanie Zarriello, said shootings of citizens by officers go unpunished because the officers remain anonymous. \\"Like Ku Klux Klansmen with hoods, (officers) do everything they can in order to protect their identities for fear of being brought to justice,\\" said Zarriello. \\"Just as the names and addresses of sex offenders are publicized in order to protect the public from their wicked behavior, we feel that our community has the right to the exact same level of protection.\\" San Antonio's police chief said Friday that Scott was holding a cellphone, not a gun as officers feared, when he was killed. The 36-year-old was fatally shot at a north San Antonio apartment complex by officers trying to serve two felony weapons and drug warrants for his arrest Thursday evening. At a news conference Friday, Police Chief William McManus said Officer John Lee approached the suspect as he stepped from a car and told Scott to raise his hands. McManus says Scott spun quickly with something in his hand. Lee, fearing for his life, shot him in the upper torso. Scott died where he fell. Lee, who's a 10-year veteran of the San Antonio Police Department, has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a department investigation. ||||| Stephanie Zarriello, San Antonio Observer (Photo: KENS 5) A local tabloid said Saturday that it is \\"looking into the future prospects\\" of publicizing San Antonio Police officers' names and addresses in response to a deadly officer-involved shooting. KENS 5 attended a news conference where that announcement was made after being told the media would hear from a witness to the shooting of Antronie Scott. That didn't happen. Scott's family was also there but didn't speak either. The deadly shooting of a man at the hands of a San Antonio police officer is under investigation by the department. An investigation is standard any time a police officer is involved in a shooting. Scott, 36, was being followed by an undercover police officer Thursday night. Police said when Scott got into a car in a parking lot on Sahara Street, a uniformed officer was called in to arrest him. According to the department, the officer saw something in Scott's hands that he believed was a gun. He shot Scott once in the chest, killing him. The object in Scott's hand turned out to be a cell phone. No gun was found at the scene. The San Antonio Observer, a tabloid, called a news conference and spoke on behalf of Scott's family.

For the natto, you'll need 4 cups (800 g) of soybeans. Place the beans in a colander or strainer, and rinse them thoroughly under cold water in the sink.","completion":"Step 1: Soak the soybeans After washing the soybeans, transfer them to a large bowl and cover them with plenty of water. Soak the soybeans for at least 8-12 hours. The soaking time will allow the beans to absorb water and become softer, making it easier to cook them thoroughly. Step 2: Drain and prepare the soybeans for cooking Once the soybeans have soaked for the appropriate amount of time, drain them and transfer them to a pressure cooker or a large pot. Add enough water to cover the soybeans by 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm). This will ensure that the beans are cooked evenly. Step 3: Cook the soybeans If using a pressure cooker, cook the soybeans on high pressure for 45-50 minutes. If using a regular pot, bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the soybeans for about 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and can be easily mashed. Step 4: Drain the cooked soybeans and cool Once the soybeans are cooked, drain off the excess water and let them cool to room temperature. Cooling the beans will help to prevent over-culturing and ensure a desirable texture for the natto. Step 5: Add the natto starter culture When the soybeans have cooled, it's time to add the natto starter culture. This can usually be purchased online and comes in powder form. Follow the package instructions for the amount to use, which typically ranges from 0.1-0.2 g per 1 kg of soybeans. Mix the starter culture thoroughly with the soybeans, ensuring even distribution of the bacteria. Step 6: Ferment the natto Transfer the soybeans to a sterilized container or tray, and cover them with plastic wrap, making sure there are a few small holes for ventilation. Place the container in a warm, temperature-stable environment, usually around 100°F (38°C) for 24 hours. During this time, the beneficial bacteria in the natto starter culture will ferment the soybeans, producing the characteristic natto texture and flavor. Step 7: Check the natto and refrigerate After the fermentation period, check the natto to make sure it has the desired texture and aroma. If it looks and smells right, transfer it to a clean container, cover, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. This will allow the flavors to mellow and the consistency to firm up. Step 8: Enjoy your homemade natto Once the natto has rested in the refrigerator, it's ready to enjoy. Natto can be eaten on its own or mixed with rice, vegetables, and other ingredients to create a variety of dishes.

It's nice to imagine that an original German-language print might improve matters--the comedic English-language dubbing isn't funny at all--but truthfully, this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you're likely to see. The zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever, and they don't seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal. However, they're also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation. George Romero's Land of the Dead posited a zombie nation that retained a shred of social coherence; here, zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginings of director Andreas Schnaas. Utterly without redeeming social value, and even worse, entirely lacking as entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bad joke on anyone who wastes money on it.","completion":"A). negative The text contains phrases such as \\"It's awful\\", \\"worst amateur films\\", \\"utterly without redeeming social value\\", and \\"entirely lacking as entertainment\\", which indicate a strongly negative sentiment about the reviewed film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Her bus had inched along through heavy morning traffic, making her a few minutes late for her very first job. She decided to start out half an hour earlier the next day Once inside the lobby, she had to stand at the elevators and wait several minutes before she could get on one going to the sixth floor. When she finally reached the office marked \\"King Enterprises\\", she knocked at the door nervously and waited. There was no answer. She tapped on the door again, but still, there was no reply. From inside the next office, she could hear the sound of voices, so she opened the door and went in. Although she was sure it was the same office she had been in two weeks before when she had had the interview with Mr King, it looked quite different now. In fact, it hardly looked like an office at all. The employees were just standing around chatting and smoking. At the far end of the room, somebody must have just told a good joke, she thought, because there was a loud burst of laughter as she came in. For a moment she had thought they were laughing at her. Then one of the men looked at his watch, clapped his hands and said something to the others. Quickly they all went to their desks and, in a matter of seconds, everyone was hard at work. No one paid any attention to Marie. Finally she went up to the man who was sitting at the desk nearest to the door and explained that this was her first day in the office. Hardly looking up from his work, he told her to have a seat and wait for Mr King, who would arrive at any moment. Then Marie realised that the day's work in the office began just before Mr King arrived. Later she found out that he lived in Connecticut and came into Manhattan on the same train every morning, arriving in the office at 9:35, so that his staff knew exactly when to start working.

One evening near the small Serbian village of Stetl, early in the nineteenth century, schoolmaster Albert Müller witnesses his wife Anna taking a little girl, Jenny Schilt, into the castle of Count Mitterhaus, a reclusive nobleman rumored to be a vampire responsible for the disappearances of other children. The rumours prove true, as Anna, who has become Mitterhaus' willing acolyte and mistress, gives Jenny to him to be drained of her blood. Men from the village, directed by Müller and including Jenny's father Mr. Schilt and the Bürgermeister, invade the castle and attack the Count. After the vampire kills several of them, Müller succeeds in driving a wooden stake through his heart. With his dying breath, Mitterhaus curses the villagers, vowing that their children will die to give him back his life. The angry villagers force Anna to run a gauntlet, but when her husband intervenes, she runs back into the castle where the briefly revived Count tells her to find his cousin Emil at \\"the Circus of Night\\". After laying his body in the crypt, she escapes through an underground tunnel as the villagers blow the castle with gunpowder and set fire to it.

Make coffee in a french press","completion":"Making coffee in a French Press is a relatively simple process, but it does require some attention to detail and a little bit of practice to perfect. Here is a detailed guide on how to make coffee in a French Press: 1. Gather your equipment: You will need a French Press, a coffee grinder (preferably a burr grinder), fresh coffee beans, a kitchen scale, a timer, a stirring spoon or paddle, and hot water. You may also want a kettle to heat your water and a vessel to serve the coffee. 2. Measure your coffee beans: The first step in creating a great cup of coffee is using the correct coffee-to-water ratio. A standard ratio is 1:15, which means 1 gram of coffee for every 15 grams of water. For example, if you are making coffee using 30 grams of coffee, you will need 450 grams of water. You may adjust the ratio to your taste preferences; for stronger coffee, use a 1:13 or 1:14 ratio. 3. Grind the beans: Set your grinder to a coarse setting specifically suited for French Press coffee. A consistent grind is crucial to ensure an even extraction, which contributes to the overall flavor. Coarse grinds are preferred for French Press brewing because they prevent the coffee grounds from passing through the mesh filter. 4. Preheat the French Press: Pour hot water into the press to warm it up. This helps maintain the temperature during brewing and ensures your coffee stays hot for a longer time. After around 30 seconds, discard the hot water. 5. Add coffee grounds: Place the French Press on the kitchen scale and reset the scale to zero. Add the pre-weighed coffee grounds into the press. 6. Boil the water: The ideal water temperature for French Press coffee is between 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C). If you do not have a temperature-controlled kettle, let the water rest for 30 seconds after boiling before using it. 7. Start the timer and add water: Begin pouring the hot water over the coffee grounds, starting at the center and working your way outward in a slow, circular motion. Pour half of the total water until all the coffee grounds are saturated, and then give the coffee a gentle stir with a stirring utensil to ensure even saturation. Let the coffee bloom for 30 seconds, which allows the coffee grounds to release trapped gases and promotes a more even extraction. 8. Pour the remaining water and cover the press: Continue pouring the hot water, filling up the French Press to the desired level. Put the lid on the French Press with the plunger in the raised position to trap heat inside. 9. Steep the coffee: Allow the coffee to steep for about 4 minutes. You can modify the steeping time based on your taste preferences - a shorter steeping time will yield a milder coffee while a longer steeping time will result in a stronger brew. 10. Press the plunger: Slowly press the plunger down, using even pressure to separate the coffee grounds from the liquid. Do not apply too much force, as this can cause coffee grounds to pass through the filter and into your coffee. 11. Pour the coffee: Immediately pour the coffee into a serving vessel or preheated cups to prevent over-extraction and maintain the temperature. Leaving the coffee in the French Press with the grounds can lead to a bitter taste. 12. Enjoy and clean up: Enjoy your freshly brewed French Press coffee! Clean your French Press thoroughly to prevent any residual oils from affecting the taste of your next brew. Disassemble the plunger and mesh filter, remove the coffee grounds, and wash each part with mild soap and warm water. Dry thoroughly before reassembling. That's it! With a little patience and practice, you can make a delicious and full-bodied cup of French Press coffee at home. Experiment with different coffee beans, grind sizes, water temperatures, and brewing times to find the combination that suits your taste preferences best."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a summary of the entire process: 1. People breathe and expel carbon dioxide (CO2): When we breathe, our body uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct. As we exhale, we release that CO2 into the atmosphere. 2. Engines produce carbon dioxide: The combustion of fossil fuels in engines (cars, trucks, power plants, etc.) releases CO2 as a byproduct. 3. Living things produce waste: All living organisms generate waste products through their metabolic processes. 4. Waste decomposes: Bacteria and other microorganisms break down waste materials through decomposition. 5. Decomposition produces methane (CH4): Some forms of decomposition, particularly in anaerobic environments, release methane, a potent greenhouse gas. 6. Water evaporates: Sunlight and heat cause water to evaporate from the Earth's surface, turning it into water vapor. 7. Water vapor joins the atmosphere: The evaporated water vapor enters the atmosphere, where it can contribute to cloud formation and participate in the water cycle. The final step: These greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and water vapor) contribute to the greenhouse effect, trapping heat within the Earth's atmosphere. This results in an increase in global temperatures and drives climate change, which has significant implications for ecosystems, weather patterns, and sea levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has backed out of next month's visit to Moscow for World War II anniversary celebrations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. \\"We were informed of the decision via diplomatic channels,\\" Peskov said. \\"The decision is connected with North Korean domestic affairs.\\" The visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of North Korea in late 2011. He was to have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit to coincide with Victory Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II Kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments, including the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam and Venezuela. This number represents about half the world leaders that Russia has said it invited to the celebrations. Kim's trip had been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation. There was no further explanation, from Moscow or Pyongyang, as to why he wouldn't head west. Still, North Korea has a number of issues it's been wrestling with for years. They include widespread poverty, its longstanding spat with neighboring South Korea and the United States, as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program. And news about Kim's non-visit comes a day after South Korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that Kim is ruling with an iron fist , having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions detailed by Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy who attended the closed briefing. And the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear. That said, North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. And there's little doubt that Kim is very much in charge. According to Shin, intelligence officials say the North Korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own. ||||| MOSCOW (AP) — The leader of North Korea will not be coming to Moscow next month for the Victory Day celebration, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman announced Thursday. The highly anticipated trip would have been Kim Jong Un's first foreign trip since taking power more than three years ago. The Russian foreign minister had said in March that Kim was among 26 world leaders who had accepted invitations to take part in the May 9 celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. North Korea, however, had never confirmed that Kim planned to come. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press \\"internal matters\\" were preventing Kim from leaving North Korea. He did not elaborate. On Wednesday, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers that Kim had ordered the execution of 15 senior officials this year who were accused of challenging his authority. Since taking over North Korea's leadership after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011, Kim has removed members of the old guard through a series of purges — including the 2013 execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, for alleged treason. Jang was married to Kim Jong Il's sister and was once considered the second most powerful man in North Korea. ||||| Summary:","completion":"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has decided not to attend the upcoming World War II anniversary celebrations in Moscow next month, as informed by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The reasons behind this decision are tied to North Korea's domestic affairs. Kim's visit to Moscow carried substantial importance as it would have been his first official foreign trip since he took over the leadership of North Korea in 2011. The visit's itinerary included meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and interaction with leaders from about 30 other countries - China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam, and Venezuela, to name a few. This decision of backing out from the MOSCOW trip surprised many as this visit had been highly discussed since the invitation was sent by Russia in December last year. No further explanations were provided by either Moscow or Pyongyang, for calling off the visit. In recent times, North Korea has been dealing with critical domestic problems such as widespread poverty, disagreements with South Korea and the United States, and its controversial international nuclear program, which has led to its significant global isolation. Furthermore, this news comes at a time when Kim's strict ruling style is being scrutinized. South Korean intelligence agencies have reported that Kim has ordered the execution of approximately 15 senior officials so far this year. The allegations have not been independently verified yet due to North Korea's closed social structure. However, it is widely accepted that Kim Jong Un, who does not tolerate disagreement, maintains absolute control over North Korean affairs. This control extends to eliminating figures from the old guard, as evident from the execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, for alleged treason in 2013. Jang, once the second most powerful man in North Korea, was married to Kim's aunt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: By what process does oxygen enter the pores of flatworms? A: Answer:","completion":"The process by which oxygen enters the pores of flatworms is known as diffusion, a passive process that involves the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration. Flatworms, belonging to the phylum Platyhelminthes, are simple and primitive animals that lack specialized respiratory organs, such as lungs or gills. Instead, they rely on their flattened body shape and large surface area to volume ratio to facilitate the absorption of oxygen directly from the surrounding water or moist terrestrial environment. Here is a description of the process through which oxygen enters the pores of flatworms: 1. Contact with the environment: Flatworms are generally found in aquatic habitats (such as freshwater, brackish, or marine environments) or in damp terrestrial habitats, where they remain in constant contact with water or moisture. This moist environment helps maintain a thin layer of fluid on their body surface, which is essential for the diffusion process to take place. 2. Body structure: The flat body of these worms offers a large surface area for efficient gas exchange. Their dorsoventrally compressed body allows for greater contact with the environment, hence facilitating the diffusion of oxygen across the body surface. 3. Epidermis: The flatworm's outermost layer of cells, known as the epidermis, is made up of a mixture of ciliated cells (which help with locomotion), gland cells (which secrete mucus), and sensory cells. Oxygen first makes contact with this single layer of epidermal cells, which also has numerous pores filled with mucus. 4. Diffusion across the body wall: Oxygen molecules in the surrounding aquatic environment or the moist terrestrial substrate have a higher concentration than those inside the flatworm's body. Due to this concentration gradient, oxygen molecules diffuse passively through the fluid-filled pores in the epidermis and across the thin body wall, entering the cells of the organism. 5. Oxygen transport: Once inside the flatworm's body, the oxygen molecules dissolve in the cellular fluid known as cytoplasm. Some species of flatworms also have a rudimentary circulatory system, in which the oxygen can dissolve and be transported throughout the body. 6. Cellular respiration: The dissolved oxygen molecules then reach various body tissues and cells, where they are utilized for cellular respiration. Through the process of cellular respiration, the cells generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is essential for all the biological functions of the organism. Meanwhile, the waste product carbon dioxide is produced during cellular respiration. 7. Removal of carbon dioxide: The carbon dioxide molecules diffuse in the reverse direction, moving from an area of high concentration within the flatworm's body to an area of lower concentration outside in the environment. This passive transport of carbon dioxide molecules involves the same diffusion process across the body wall through the pores in the epidermis. In summary, flatworms rely on the passive process of diffusion to permit the exchange of gases directly through their body surface. Oxygen molecules from the surrounding environment diffuse through the epidermis and body wall into the cells, where they participate in cellular respiration, generating energy essential for the organism's survival. The waste product carbon dioxide diffuses out of the body through the same process. The environment's moisture, flatworm's thin body, and large surface area to volume ratio collectively help facilitate efficient gas exchange in these simple organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
