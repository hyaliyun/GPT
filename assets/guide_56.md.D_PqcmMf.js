Her career has spanned over 30 years. Her debut solo album She's So Unusual (1983) Context: Lauper was born at Boulevard Hospital in Astoria, Queens, New York City, to a Catholic family. Her father, Fred, was of German and Swiss descent. Her mother, Catrine (nee Gallo), is Italian American (from Sicily). Lauper's siblings are younger brother Fred (nicknamed Butch), and older sister, Ellen. Lauper's parents divorced when she was five. Her mother remarried and divorced again. Lauper grew up in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens and, as a child, listened to such artists as The Beatles, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland and Billie Holiday. At age 12, she began writing songs and playing an acoustic guitar given to her by her sister. Lauper expressed herself with a variety of hair colors, eccentric clothing and even took a friend's advice to spell her name as \\"Cyndi\\" rather than \\"Cindy\\". Lauper went to Richmond Hill High School, but was expelled, although she later earned her GED. She left home at 17, to escape her abusive stepfather, intending to study art. Her journey took her to Canada, where she spent two weeks in the woods with her dog Sparkle, trying to find herself. She eventually traveled to Vermont, where she took art classes at Johnson State College and supported herself working odd jobs. In the early 1970s, Lauper performed as a vocalist with various cover bands. One, called Doc West, covered disco songs as well as Janis Joplin. A later band, Flyer, was active in the New York metropolitan area, singing hits by bands including Bad Company, Jefferson Airplane and Led Zeppelin. Although Lauper was performing on stage, she was not happy singing covers. In 1977, Lauper damaged her vocal cords and took a year off from singing. She was told by doctors that she would never sing again, but regained her voice with the help of vocal coach Katie Agresta. Question: What music did she like as a young adult? Answer:","completion":"As a young adult, Cyndi Lauper enjoyed listening to various artists and genres, including The Beatles, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, and Billie Holiday.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I have known, and admired, Julia Busuttil Nishimura, for many years now and always felt connected through our love of Italian food, Tuscany (Julia lived in Florence and in Orbetello, just 10 minutes away from where we lived in Porto Ercole while I was writing Acquacotta) and Japan. So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already.

A round bo staff is not a helicopter blade, you cannot fly by twirling super-duper fast. Which Gambit wouldn't be able to do anyway.

The reviewer even draws a comparison to another film, \\"Daredevil,\\" which they perceive to have similarly disappointing qualities.

Summarize the following: Also referred to as the Destiny Number, the Expression Number highlights the personal gifts and shortcomings you brought into this world. If your Life Path reveals the road on which you walk, the Expression Number reveals the flavor and character of your steps. Considered from the perspective of reincarnation, your Life Path Number is akin to the lesson you must learn this lifetime. Connected to this, your Expression Number reflects the core being - including your personal history from any past lifetimes - that you brought with you to Earth. The name is used because it represents the inborn character of the self as well as that which was passed down to you at birth. Similar to calculating your Life Path Number, we reduce the number values of each name individually before combining the results. This honors the individual character your name's (and self's) different facets before uncovering their combined meaning. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z As an example, we'll take the name Robert Nesta Marley.

And so Bob Marley has an Expression Number of 22. Summary:","completion":"The Expression Number, also known as Destiny Number, represents one's personal gifts, shortcomings, and inherent character traits brought into this world. It works in conjunction with the Life Path Number, which reveals the road an individual walks, while the Expression Number showcases the flavor and character of their journey. From a reincarnation perspective, the Life Path Number represents the lessons to be learned in this lifetime, while the Expression Number reflects the core being and past lifetime history. To calculate the Expression Number, the number values of each letter in a person's name are reduced and then combined. This process acknowledges the unique aspects of the individual's name and self before revealing their collective meaning. Using the example of Robert Nesta Marley, his Expression Number is calculated as follows: ROBERT = 9+6+2+5+9+2 = 33 = 3+3 = 6 NESTA = 5+5+1+2+1 = 14 = 1+4 = 5 MARLEY = 4+1+9+3+5+7 = 29 = 2+9 = 11 By adding the reduced values together, we get 6+5+11 = 22.

It is composed of 12 pairs of ribs with their costal cartilages and the sternum. The ribs are anchored posteriorly to the 12 thoracic vertebrae. The sternum consists of the manubrium, body, and xiphoid process. The manubrium and body are joined at the sternal angle, which is also the site for attachment of the second ribs. Ribs are flattened, curved bones and are numbered 1–12. Posteriorly, the head of the rib articulates with the costal facets located on the bodies of thoracic vertebrae and the rib tubercle articulates with the facet located on the vertebral transverse process. The angle of the ribs forms the most posterior portion of the thoracic cage. The costal groove in the inferior margin of each rib carries blood vessels and a nerve. Anteriorly, each rib ends in a costal cartilage. True ribs (1–7) attach directly to the sternum via their costal cartilage. The false ribs (8–12) either attach to the sternum indirectly or not at all. Ribs 8–10 have their costal cartilages attached to the cartilage of the next higher rib.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Hague (or \\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s-Gravenhage\\" ) is a city located in the western coast of the Netherlands, and the capital city of the province of South Holland. - Amsterdam is the capital and most populous municipality of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Its status as the capital is mandated by the Constitution of the Netherlands, although it is not the seat of the government, which is The Hague. Amsterdam has a population of 847,176 within the city proper, 1,343,647 in the urban area, and 2,431,000 in the Amsterdam metropolitan area. The city is located in the province of North Holland in the west of the country. The metropolitan area comprises much of the northern part of the Randstad, one of the larger conurbations in Europe, with a population of approximately 7 million. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\". - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\"). - The Dommel is a stream in Belgium and the Netherlands, left tributary of the Dieze. It rises in north-eastern Belgium near Peer and flows into the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dommel takes in water from the Keersop, Tongelreep, Run, Gender and Kleine Dommel streams and merges at 's-Hertogenbosch with the Aa stream to form river Dieze, which subsequently flows towards the Meuse. The main cities and towns along the Dommel's course are Peer, Neerpelt, Valkenswaard, Dommelen, Eindhoven, Son en Breugel, Sint-Oedenrode, Boxtel, Sint-Michielsgestel and 's-Hertogenbosch. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area called the Dommelbeemden. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city.

Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries). - Noord Brabant, also unofficially called Brabant, is a province in the south of the Netherlands. It borders the provinces of South Holland and Gelderland to the north, Limburg to the east, Zeeland to the west, and the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Limburg to the south. The northern border follows the Meuse (Maas) river westward to its mouth in the Hollands Diep strait, part of the RhineMeuseScheldt delta. History. The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands. Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794. - Operation Market Garden (1725 September 1944) was an unsuccessful Allied military operation, fought in the Netherlands and Germany in the Second World War. The operation was split into two sub-operations: - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Koninklijk or Koninklijke (Dutch for \\"Royal\\") is an honorary title given to certain companies and non-profit organizations in Belgium and the Netherlands, by the monarchs of each country. It was first introduced by Louis Bonaparte in 1807, then King of the Netherlands, who awarded the title to cultural associations. Companies awarded with the title may opt to use the English equivalent 'Royal' instead. It is comparable with the Royal Warrant in the UK. - Nuenen , Gerwen en Nederwetten ( pronunciation ) is a municipality consisting of the larger village of Nuenen and two adjacent smaller ones . It is located in the province of Noord - Brabant , about 10 kilometres ( 6.2 mi ) east of Eindhoven , the fifth largest city in the Netherlands . From being a small farmers town of less than 1000 inhabitants around 1950 Nuenen grew steadily as ever more new employees of Philips and the Eindhoven University ( TUE ) chose Nuenen as their new home . - The Kingdom of the Netherlands , commonly known as the Netherlands, is a sovereign state and constitutional monarchy with territory in western Europe and in the Caribbean. - Rotterdam is a city in the Netherlands, located in South Holland, within the RhineMeuseScheldt river delta at the North Sea. Its history goes back to 1270 when a dam was constructed in the Rotte river by people settled around it for safety.

In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on. - Nuenen is a town in the municipality of Nuenen, Gerwen en Nederwetten in the Netherlands. From 1883 to 1885, Vincent van Gogh lived and worked in Nuenen. In 1944, the town was a battle scene during Operation Market Garden. The local dialect is called Peellands. In 2009, Nuenen had a population of 22,437. - Gerard Leonardo Frederik Philips (9 October 1858 26 January 1942) was a Dutch industrialist, co-founder (with his father Frederik Philips) of the Philips Company as a family business in 1891. Gerard and his younger brother Anton Philips changed the business to a corporation by founding in 1912 the NV Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: What bonds form because they give atoms a more stable arrangement of electrons? A: Answer:","completion":"The bonds that form because they give atoms a more stable arrangement of electrons are known as chemical bonds. Chemical bonding plays a crucial role in determining the properties of substances and enabling the formation of various compounds in nature. There are several types of chemical bonds, including covalent bonds, ionic bonds, metallic bonds, and hydrogen bonds. 1. Covalent Bonds: These bonds involve the sharing of one or more pairs of electrons between two atoms so that each atom achieves a more stable electronic configuration. Typically, covalent bonds form between nonmetal atoms with similar electronegativities, resulting in the creation of stable molecules. In covalent bonding, electron-sharing assists both atoms in achieving noble gas-like electronic configurations, offering greater stability. 2. Ionic Bonds: These bonds form when electrons are transferred from one atom to another due to a significant difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. Ionic bonding commonly occurs between a metal and a nonmetal atom. When a metal atom transfers one or more electrons to a nonmetal atom, it creates positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions). These oppositely charged ions are attracted to one another, forming an ionic bond and leading to a stable ionic compound. 3. Metallic Bonds: These bonds occur among metal atoms, resulting in the formation of a \\"sea of electrons\\" or \\"electron cloud\\" that surrounds positively charged metal cores. In metallic bonding, valence electrons are not fixed to individual atoms; instead, they are free to move within the metallic lattice structure. This delocalization of electrons creates an electrostatic attractive force between the positively charged metal ions and the electron cloud, providing stability to the metal structure. Metallic bonds are responsible for the characteristic properties of metals, such as malleability, ductility, and electrical conductivity. 4. Hydrogen Bonds: Hydrogen bonds are a type of intermolecular force that forms between molecules containing polar covalent bonds, specifically involving hydrogen atoms bonded to highly electronegative atoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. In hydrogen bonding, the positively charged hydrogen atom of one molecule is attracted to the negatively charged electronegative atom of another molecule. Although hydrogen bonds are weaker than covalent and ionic bonds, they play a critical role in stabilizing the structures of many compounds, particularly in biological systems. Examples of hydrogen bonding can be found in water molecules, DNA, and proteins. In conclusion, chemical bonds like covalent, ionic, metallic, and hydrogen bonds form because they allow atoms to achieve a more stable arrangement of electrons. These bonds result from the interactions between atoms due to differences in electronegativity and the need for atoms to attain a noble gas-like electronic configuration, which ensures lower energy states and increased stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The hostage's name has not been released, at the request of her family. ISIS has also demanded the release of neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, who is being held in Texas. Ransom comes a week after U.S. journalist James Foley was beheaded in a propaganda video for ISIS. Group has threatened to execute fellow-journalist Steven Sotloff next. Article:","completion":"Title: Islamist Militants Kidnap American Aid Worker in Syria, Demand Ransom and Release of Aafia Siddiqui The rise of extremist groups in volatile regions has led to an increasing number of abductions targeting foreign aid workers and journalists in recent years. One such group, the notorious terrorist organization known as ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), has demanded a ransom payment in exchange for the release of an American aid worker kidnapped from Syria last year. The identity of the hostage has been withheld at the request of her family, due to concerns for her safety. ISIS has not only sought a monetary ransom for the release of the aid worker, but has also demanded the release of neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani national who is currently being held in Texas. She is serving an 86-year sentence after being convicted of multiple felonies, including assault and attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. The demand for ransom and Siddiqui's release comes in the wake of the brutal beheading of American journalist James Foley, which was captured on film and used as a propaganda video by ISIS. The group has threatened to carry out the same gruesome fate for a fellow journalist named Steven Sotloff, whose life now hangs in the balance. The reason for ISIS demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, who has been dubbed \\"Lady al-Qaeda,\\" remains unclear. Siddiqui is a highly educated neuroscientist who studied at Brandeis University and MIT. Many speculate that her knowledge and expertise in the field may be perceived as useful for the terrorist group in their ongoing campaign of violence and destruction. The recent kidnapping and ransom demands reveal the relentless tactics employed by ISIS, exploiting civilians' vulnerability in war-torn areas and generating fear. Abducting aid workers and journalists is a particularly insidious method, as these individuals are often present in conflict zones to provide humanitarian assistance and report on the situation affecting innocent civilians. In the midst of this harrowing situation, governments have been forced to grapple with a pressing ethical dilemma: when faced with ransom demands from extremist groups, should they pay the price to secure the hostages' safe return? While yielding to these demands may save lives in the short term, some argue that it only serves to fuel terrorism by providing financial and tactical support. As such, many nations, including the United States and the United Kingdom, adhere to policies of non-negotiation with terrorists, even at the risk of hostages losing their lives. The plight of the American aid worker and the journalists held by ISIS has brought the world's attention to the terrifying reality facing those who venture into the heart of conflict regions. An international response is needed to address the root causes of terrorist activity, not just react to the symptoms. Furthermore, we must acknowledge and honor the bravery and dedication of individuals like the kidnapped aid worker, whose tireless efforts in difficult circumstances often put their own lives at risk. As Islamist militants continue to terrorize innocent civilians, it is crucial that the international community takes swift and decisive action to dismantle these extremist networks, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure that those who selflessly devote their lives to the aid and understanding of others can do so without fearing for their own safety."},{"prompt":"Q:Information: - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa.

Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane is upset by his team's loss to the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason. With the impending departure of star players Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen to free agency, Beane needs to assemble a competitive team for 2002, but must overcome Oakland's limited payroll.During a visit to the Cleveland Indians, Beane meets Peter Brand, a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about how to assess players' value. Beane tests Brand's theory by asking whether he would have drafted him (out of high school), Beane having been a Major League player before becoming general manager. Though scouts considered Beane a phenomenal prospect, his career in the Major Leagues was disappointing. After some prodding, Brand admits that he would not have drafted him until the ninth round and surmised that Beane would probably have accepted a scholarship to Stanford instead. Impressed, Beane hires the inexperienced Brand to be the Athletics assistant general manager.Oakland team scouts are first dismissive and then hostile towards Brand's non-traditional sabermetric approach to scouting players. Most notably, Grady Fuson aggressively confronts Beane, causing him to be fired. Grady then takes to the radio airwaves and doubts the team's future. Rather than relying on the scouts' experience and intuition, Brand selects players based almost exclusively on their on-base percentage (OBP). Beane signs the ones Brand suggests, such as unorthodox submarine pitcher Chad Bradford, past-his-prime outfielder David Justice, and injured Scott Hatteberg. Beane also faces opposition from Art Howe, the Athletics' manager, who does not agree with the new philosophy. With tensions already high between the two due to a contract dispute, Howe disregards Beane's and Brand's strategy and plays a lineup he prefers.Early in the season, the Athletics fare poorly, leading critics to dismiss the new method as a failure. Beane convinces the owner to stay the course. He trades away the lone traditional first baseman, Carlos PeÃ±a, to force Howe to use Hatteberg at that position, threatening to make similar deals if Howe won't cooperate. The A's win 19 consecutive games, tying for the longest winning streak in American League history. Beane's young daughter implores him to go to a game against the Kansas City Royals, where Oakland is already leading 11â0 after the third inning and appears set to win a record-breaking 20th game in a row. Like many baseball players, Beane is superstitious and avoids games in progress, but upon hearing how well the game is going on the radio, he decides to go. Beane arrives in the fourth inning, only to watch the team falter and eventually allow the Royals to even the score at 11. Finally, the A's do win, on a walk-off home run by Hatteberg.After celebrating that, however, the A's again lose in the postseason, this time to the Minnesota Twins. Beane is disappointed, believing nothing short of a championship should be considered a success. He is contacted by the owner of the Boston Red Sox, who realizes that the sabermetric model is the future of baseball. Beane declines an opportunity to be GM of the Red Sox, despite the 12.5 million salary, which would have made him the highest-paid general manager in sports history. He returns to Oakland, while an epilogue reveals that two years later, the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series, using the model pioneered by the Athletics., Question: Where did Beane meet Peter Brand?

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you’re talking to someone and they seem judgmental or like they’re prying into your personal life, just say that you’re doing fine. You don’t have to share anything you don’t want to. People who are nosy don’t necessarily need to know what’s going on in your life. It’s perfectly fine to pretend that you’re doing great. For example, if you go to family gatherings and get pestered by older family members, say things are great, even if they’re not. Even if you’re sad about things, pretend like life is going okay and don’t say much beyond that. If someone is talking about something you’re uncomfortable with, change the topic of conversation. Excuse yourself for a moment and come back in a bit. Shift the subject of the conversation away to something else without feeling too abrupt. If someone asks how you’re doing and you’re not prepared to say how you really feel, shift the subject by saying, “I’m really happy to see that the sun is out today.” If someone asks, “How are you and your spouse?” and you’d rather not talk about your marital difficulties, change the subject. Say, “We’re doing fine. Did I tell you about my son’s recent karate match?” Avoid saying too much or getting into detailed stories. The point is to say as little as possible and perhaps even duck out of the conversation. This will help to shut down the conversation or move on to another topic to talk about. For example, if someone asks about your love life and you’d rather not get into it, say, “Great, thanks for asking.” If you can’t keep up your pretenses, end the conversation. Find a lull and speak up. For example, you can take a quick out by saying, “It’s been great talking” or “So glad we got to catch up,” and then make an exit.","completion":"The article provides advice on how to deal with nosy or judgmental people by keeping personal information private, sharing minimal details, shifting the conversation topic, and gracefully ending interactions to maintain a sense of comfort and emotional well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He discovered that Robert has more villi covering his jejunum compared to John. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who has more surface area available for absorption of nutrients? Hint: The jejunum is the second part of the small intestine, where most nutrients are absorbed into the blood. As shown in Figure below , the mucous membrane lining the jejunum is covered with millions of microscopic, fingerlike projections called villi (singular, villus). Villi contain many capillaries, and nutrients pass from the villi into the bloodstream through the capillaries. Because there are so many villi, they greatly increase the surface area for absorption. In fact, they make the inner surface of the small intestine as large as a tennis court!

Question: What language was replaced in Central Asia? Context: The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Today is a new year. A new start. Fresh beginnings. I am inspired in the name of that optimism to share something with my readership today: I’m not doing well. In fact, I’m really struggling. I’ve been extremely overwhelmed recently, in a lot of different ways. I think it’s time to share that with all of you in the hopes that speaking my truth will allow me to move forward– and also in the hopes that anybody else who is trying to hold it all together with similarly emotional results will know it’s ok to let go– to accept help, forgive themselves, and to move towards a solution. So here it is, I’m in an emotionally bad place, for reasons I will explain. I’m depleted and anxious, and I haven’t been giving my anxiety and feelings the attention they deserve for a little while now. I’ve been hoping that powering through would get me to the other side, but I’ve finally realized that feelings don’t work like that. Nice try, Martino! Lol. I’m the type of personality who tries my hardest to be optimistic and fight through, but as my husband put so well a couple of days ago, sometimes fighting emotion is like quicksand– the more you fight, the more it grabs you until eventually it pulls you under. Here is my effort to unclutch, to stop furiously pedaling, to share and to move forward. But first, I have to share with you something that happened to our family in November that has deeply affected all of us, and that I have been practically too emotional to speak of since. A couple of days after Thanksgiving, our Night Nurse fell asleep while holding Major and dropped him, and he cracked his head on the hardwood floor. Kyle and I were sleeping at the time and were awoken by the sound of his head hitting the floor, and then hysterical piercing screams. He suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on his brain, and was transported by ambulance to Yale Medical Center where I spent two harrowing days with him to receive emergency care and further testing. To say these were the most traumatic and anxious two days of my life is an understatement. If you read my post about choosing Homebirth, you know that I have an (irrational) phobia of Hospitals. To be in one for two days under such circumstances was nearly unbearable for me, not to mention how scary and emotional those days were for the entirety of our family. But here’s the good part: by the grace of all of his many angels, and every God one cares to pray to, MAJOR IS FINE. Completely fine. Though he had the fracture, some skull displacement, and bleeding, the skull did not touch his brain and the bleeding was localized. Further MRI’s showed no brain damage and we were discharged by experts in pediatrics and neurology with as excellent of a prognosis as we could have ever hoped for. We were absolutely, divinely lucky that day. He had no other broken bones, and no spinal effects whatsoever. He has been healing well, hitting milestones, cooing, smiling, and generally showing us that he is and will be ok as he grows and develops. So why didn’t I share this when it happened? A couple of reasons. First of all, the accident traumatized all of us. It was so sudden, and so scary, and the idea of sharing it almost felt like it would make it all that much more real– all of the risks and the dangers. I wanted to make sure that he was definitely OK before I shared what had happened, so that I could have some good news to celebrate. I don’t know if this reaction will make sense to a lot of people, it hardly makes sense to me, but that’s what I was (or wasn’t) capable of at the time. The second reason I chose not to share was fear of judgement. The internet can be a peculiar place, where some people forget about humanity and go for the jugular. I know that this news might reach many, and of those many there will always be the people who say that this accident was my fault. That if it had been me in there holding him instead of a Night Nurse, that this never would have happened. That I deserve this for allowing my child to be in the care of somebody other than me. Well, let me tell you– the guilt I bore in the days and weeks after this accident was more intense and more damaging than anything I would wish upon my worst enemy. I had all those same thoughts and more. I wept in the hospital, telling anyone who would listen that it should have been me. That I was to blame. The truth is, even this woman who came so highly recommended, with a perfectly clean track record, could make a very human mistake. It “could happen to anyone”, and as they told me repeatedly in the hospital, it DOES happen to anyone. More often than you’d like to hear. Obviously, the (extremely upset and remorseful) nurse is no longer working for our family, though we forgive her. And even though I finally made peace with the fact that this freak accident could not have been avoided by me, it has continued to effect me to my core and in all aspects of my daily life. It’s nearly impossible for me to trust anyone but myself to take care of Major now. We definitely don’t have night time help anymore, but it has only been in the past week or so that I have felt comfortable with somebody coming during the day to help me with him so that I can complete normal tasks and work responsibilities. Hearing Major cry hard immediately triggers my memories of the moments after the accident and instigates an immediate panic attack– my heart races and tears spring to my eyes. Sometimes I get dizzy spells. I feel nauseous and overwhelmed and even small discomforts he has make me anxious. My appetite has decreased to nothing, I have a hard time getting to sleep after night time feedings, and my milk supply goes up and down depending on the stresses of the day. Any time we are near an edge or a ledge, I fear that he will fall, somehow, and be hurt again. Just last week, we were on the second floor of a Starbucks, and I sat there panicked and frozen as I imagined Major falling from my arms over the edge of the banister and on to the floor below. My brain played back the sound of his screams that night. I had to close my eyes and clench my teeth as the waves of nausea eventually subsided. To cope through all of this the past month, I had been trying to breathe, to talk myself down, to remind myself that my son is alright, that we are all alright. But while we were in Charleston on our Christmas vacation, Marlowe had a fall on the playground. She was trying to go down the slide and fell on to the ground on her back, knocking the wind out of her. Within ten minutes she was totally fine and normal– but I stood there while Kyle held me, sobbing and shaking, while my scared two year old watched. It was then that I really realized that I am not okay. And, unfortunately, trying to push through these experiences and feelings, keep up with work and with my parental responsibilities, has just pushed me deeper in the quicksand. I’ve been easily overwhelmed, and between follow up doctor visits for Major, and the stresses of learning our rhythm as a family of four, I have felt most of my other responsibilities slipping through the cracks. I think I need to take some things off of my plate. It’s time to really face this all and find a solution. My instinct tells me that I have some form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, possibly linked to some form of Postpartum Depression. I was only three weeks postpartum when my husband fell off the roof of our house while cleaning the gutters (I shared this on Instagram when it happened, in case you missed it) and could have easily been killed or paralyzed according to the ER doctors. In another miraculous stroke of luck, he walked out of the ER with minor injuries. Just two weeks later was when Major had his accident. My hormones were still not stable from the birth, and I suspect that all of this in succession probably triggered something. I’m not a doctor and I haven’t been diagnosed by anyone, so I don’t know for sure. Even typing those words scares me and makes me realize that there may be a longer road ahead to feel better than I would hope for. But I know that the way I’m feeling, though understandable and human, is not normal. My husband has been instrumental the past week in helping me acknowledge this. He has held me and loved me unconditionally enough to convince me that facing all of this will end in relief and not in disaster. I’m choosing to trust that. I finally feel secure enough to admit that it is possible for me to feel better than I do today. I deserve that, and my family deserves that. I’m going to focus on working with a therapist who can help me find better coping mechanisms than what I can come up with on my own, and who will hopefully help me understand a way forward. I have somehow retained a lot of optimism and humor through these challenges, and there have been many moments in the past month where I have found silver linings in the day– but the storm under the surface has been brewing to a point that I can no longer ignore. So what does this mean for the blog? I’m going to take the next couple of weeks off to focus on myself and my family. I have a couple of posts in the pipeline that I will be releasing (one about breastfeeding and the other involves a super cute Marlowe VIDEO!) but otherwise I’m going to be tuning in to what I need to do to get back on my feet. I know that once I dedicate myself fully to understanding what I’m going through that I will begin to get better. Even writing this and speaking my truth today has parted the clouds a bit. On my blog, I have always maintained that true happiness can be found even amidst chaos and imperfection. That it is these ups and downs that make us great parents and good people. I have never believed this more than I do now. I believe that my challenges and struggles the past month have shown me the depths of my strength, and that handling my shortcomings gracefully will make me grow as a woman and as a Mom. I can only hope that this is true. With open arms, I welcome 2017 as the year I learn to forgive a little deeper, to let go a little more easily, to accept some things I cannot change, and to love myself a lot more unconditionally. To anybody else who is suffering from similar feelings or challenges, no matter the cause– I am with you in this. Let’s get better. It’s time. Thank you all for your support the past month, your kind words, and your voices– even when you didn’t know that I needed help, you all helped me so much. Peace, peace, peace, my friends. See you all very soon. Happy New Year!

In a blog post shared on her website HappilyEvaAfter.com, the mother of two — daughter Marlowe Mae, 2, and son Major James, 10 weeks — opened up about her difficult end to the year. “A couple of days after Thanksgiving, our Night Nurse fell asleep while holding Major and dropped him, and he cracked his head on the hardwood floor,” Amurri Martino, 31, wrote. “[Husband Kyle Martino] and I were sleeping at the time and were awoken by the sound of his head hitting the floor, and then hysterical piercing screams.

Vallon then says a prayer to St. Michael, puts a medallion over Amsterdam's head, grabs a steel cross, and marches out of his cave with Amsterdam. They walk past people making and finishing weapons, including a woman with clawed gloves named Hellcat Maggie. Vallon, his son, and the rest take communion as they continue exiting the caves. They finally reach the top level of an old brewery. They stop and Vallon asks a man named Monk if he will join them. Monk says he'll fight for pay. Vallon promises him ten dollars for every \\"new notch\\" on his club, so Monk agrees, picks up his wooden club, and kicks open the door, revealing a snow-covered intersection known as Paradise Square, the Five Points of Lower Manhattan.Vallon and his crew, the Dead Rabbits, leave the brewery and make their way onto the street. Amsterdam runs to join children on the steps of a nearby building, while the Dead Rabbits await the arrival of the Natives. A few moments later, men dressed in blue, The Natives, led by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), a ruthless New Yorker with a glass eye, walk onto the street, clearly outnumbering the Rabbits. Bill says that the ensuing fight will decide who holds the rule of the Five Points; Bill's mob who are Protestant or Vallon's Catholics. Vallon recants that it's a free country, that he and his immigrant crowd have been harassed incessantly by Bill and his men. The Rabbits are then joined by several other gangs that have allied themselves with Vallon, greatly increasing their numbers.Moments later, they begin fighting. Monk is mashing people in the head, Maggie is biting a man's ear off, and people's legs are getting broken while others are being stabbed, slashed and bludgeoned. Bill...

Given the question: SEOUL — The U.S. has indicated it is prepared to open the North Korean economy to significant private investment, if a nuclear deal can be reached. But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

About how old is a \\"\\"six-tooth\\"\\"?\\"","completion":"To answer this question, we need to determine the age of a sheep based on the number of permanent incisors that have erupted. Step 1: Understand the sheep's teeth development Sheep have temporary milk teeth that will eventually be replaced by permanent teeth as they age. A sheep's age can be estimated by the number of permanent incisors that have come in. Step 2: Research the incisor eruption timeline The common terminology refers to the number of tooth pairs, e.g. \\"two-tooth\\", \\"four-tooth\\", etc. Typically, the permanent incisors erupt for sheep as follows: - 1st pair (central incisors): 12-15 months - 2nd pair (next to central incisors): 24 months - 3rd pair (next to the 2nd pair): 36 months - 4th pair (furthest from central incisors): 48 months Step 3: Determine the age of a \\"six-tooth\\" A \\"six-tooth\\" sheep would have three pairs of permanent incisors that have erupted.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be concluded that most nutrients are washed into ocean water from land. This implies that water closer to the shore tends to have a higher concentration of nutrients due to the proximity to the land where the nutrients originate from. Now, considering the given scenario where Mona is in her sailboat and takes two samples of ocean water – one close to the shore and the other far away from the shore, the paragraph's information can be used to infer which sample will have fewer nutrients. As mentioned earlier, water closer to shore tends to have more nutrients. Thus, by contrast, water far away from the shore would have comparatively fewer nutrients than the water found near the shore.

Can we infer the following? Cookie Press won an oscar","completion":"It's not possible to infer that a cookie press won an Oscar based on the provided information. Using a cookie press is a method for making shaped cookies with consistent size and design. The process involves preparing the cookie dough and using a cookie press – a kitchen tool designed for cookie-making enthusiasts who want to produce professional-looking, uniform cookies quickly and efficiently. To use a cookie press, follow these detailed steps: 1. Prepare the cookie dough: Begin by selecting a cookie dough recipe specifically designed for a cookie press, as traditional dough may be too thick or crumbly for pressing. You'll want a dough that is soft but not sticky. 2. Chill the dough: Since the cookie press uses pressure to form the cookies, chilling the dough beforehand will make it more manageable. Cover your dough and place it in the refrigerator for at least an hour or according to the recipe instructions. 3. Assemble your cookie press: Cookie presses come in various designs, such as manual or electric. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for assembling your specific model. Verify that the press is clean, and choose the preferred disc or stencil to create the desired cookie shape. 4. Load the cookie press: Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and if needed, roll it into a log shape to easily fit into the barrel of the cookie press. Place the dough in the barrel, making sure it's filled neatly to minimize air pockets. 5. Adjust settings: If your cookie press has adjustable settings for cookie size or thickness, set these according to your preferences. 6. Press cookies onto the baking sheet: Hold the cookie press perpendicular to an ungreased or lined baking sheet. Squeeze the handle or trigger to form the cookies, allowing them to adhere to the baking sheet. Release pressure and lift the press to leave the shaped cookie on the sheet. Make sure to space the cookies evenly, as they may spread slightly during baking. 7. Decorate (optional): If you wish to add sprinkles, sugar, or other decorations, apply them before baking. This will ensure they stick to the dough while it's still soft. 8. Bake cookies: Preheat your oven to the temperature indicated in the recipe and bake the cookies for the specified time or until they are golden brown around the edges. Keep a close eye on them, as pressed cookies can bake quickly due to their delicate nature. 9. Cool and store: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, store them in an airtight container to maintain their freshness. As for Oscars, they are prestigious awards presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to recognize excellence in film and cinema industry. A cookie press is a kitchen tool and is unrelated to the Oscars or film awards.

They dim immediately when it's sunny and brighten when a passing cloud blocks the sun. A wall of windows at a University of Pennsylvania engineering building has built-in blinds controlled by a computer program that follows the sun's path. Buildings are getting smarter and the next generation of building materials is expected to do even more. Windows could catch the sun's energy to heat water. Sensors that measure the carbon dioxide breathed out by people in a room could determine whether the air conditioning needs to be turned up. Many new materials and technology have been designed in the last 15 years. They are now being used in a wave of buildings designed to save as much energy as possible. They include old ideas, like \\"green roofs\\", where a belt of plants on a roof helps the building keep heat in winter and stay cool in summer, and new ideas, like special coating for windows that lets light in, but keeps heat out. As technologies such as sensors become cheaper, their uses spread. The elevators at Seven World Trade Center, which is under construction in New York, use a system that groups people traveling to nearby floors into the same elevator, thus saving elevator stops. People who work in the building will enter it by swiping ID cards that will tell the elevators their floor, readouts will then tell them which elevator to use. The building also has windows with a coating that blocks heat while letting in light. More new building materials and technology are in development.

Weeks of rain in Peru have caused rivers to rise and people to flee. At least 62 people have been killed and more than 100 injured after heavy rain continued its wave of destruction since the rainy season began earlier this month. The Peruvian government said more than 60,000 people have been displaced and several cities have declared states of emergency.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is it like to have Washington Taylor as a Ph.D. advisor? What is it like to have Roger Blandford as a Ph.D. advisor? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"While I cannot provide firsthand experience as a human, I can offer a comprehensive analysis based on the information available about Washington Taylor and Roger Blandford as Ph.D. advisors and if the two questions entail the same meaning or not. 1. Having Washington Taylor as a Ph.D. advisor: Washington Taylor is an American physicist and string theorist who is currently a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is renowned for his work in string theory and has contributed significantly to the field. Here is an analysis of what it might be like to have Washington Taylor as a Ph.D. advisor: - Expertise: Washington Taylor's extensive knowledge in string theory, quantum field theory, and particle physics would provide a strong foundation for any student pursuing research in these areas. He would be able to offer valuable insights and guidance, along with suggestions on relevant literature and resources. - Research Environment: As a professor at MIT, Taylor's students would have access to an elite research environment with other faculty members and graduate students working on cutting-edge projects in the field of theoretical physics. This would allow them to network, collaborate, and learn from others, ultimately benefiting their own research. - Mentorship Style: While it is hard to determine an advisor's mentorship style without firsthand accounts, one can expect a Ph.D. advisor with Taylor's academic stature to have high expectations of their students and give honest, constructive feedback on their work. Such rigorous standards can put pressure on students, but it can also challenge them to grow and become better researchers. 2. Having Roger Blandford as a Ph.D. advisor: Roger Blandford is a British astrophysicist known for his work in black holes, active galactic nuclei, and compact objects. He is currently a professor of physics at Stanford University. Here is an analysis of what it might be like to have Blandford as a Ph.D. advisor: - Expertise: Blandford's work in astrophysics, black holes, and general relativity offers a wealth of knowledge and experience for students pursuing research in these areas. His guidance would be invaluable to students wishing to grasp complex astrophysical phenomena and develop innovative research ideas. - Research Environment: As part of Stanford University, students working with Blandford would have access to a world-class research setting and can engage with other faculty and students involved in diverse research projects related to astrophysics. This environment would enable them to broaden their perspectives and cultivate a strong interdisciplinary research approach. - Mentorship Style: Similar to the case with Washington Taylor, it is difficult to pinpoint Blandford's mentorship style without direct testimony. One might assume that he would also set high standards and expectations for his students, providing honest and constructive feedback to help them grow as researchers. Do the two questions have the same meaning? While the questions themselves are similar in structure, they pertain to two distinct individuals with different academic backgrounds, research interests, and affiliated institutions. Consequently, the experiences of having Washington Taylor and Roger Blandford as Ph.D. advisors would be unique given their diverse areas of expertise, mentorship styles, and respective research environments. In summary, both Washington Taylor and Roger Blandford are esteemed scholars in their respective fields, offering invaluable guidance and support to their Ph.D. students. While the questions are distinct in terms of the specific advisors they address, they are analogous in terms of exploring the dynamics of having these prestigious figures as Ph.D. advisors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money? ? The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758. The Booth-Greys then held the manor until the 19th century, whose patronage, despite being...

Solve 0 = 135*d - 30*d for d.","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = 135*d - 30*d for d, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. Both terms on the right side of the equation have the variable d. Combine the coefficients (135 - 30) to get a single term with d. 0 = 105*d Step 2: Isolate the variable d. To isolate d, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 105. 0/105 = (105*d)/105 Simplify: 0 = d Step 3: Check the result. Now, we'll plug the value of d back into the initial equation to verify the solution. 0 = 135*0 - 30*0 0 = 0 The left side of the equation equals the right side, confirming that d=0 is the correct solution to the equation 0 = 135*d - 30*d."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Do these mean the same? Jan Hambourg was born in Voronezh , Russia , the intermediate brother between the famous pianist Mark Hambourg . Mark Hambourg was born in Voronezh , Russia , as a middle brother of the famous pianist Jan Hambourg .","completion":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same. They convey different information about the relationship between Jan Hambourg and Mark Hambourg, two musicians. Let us examine each sentence closely to understand the differences between them. 1. The first sentence describes Jan Hambourg as being born in Voronezh, Russia, and positions him as the intermediate brother between Mark Hambourg, a famous pianist, and potentially another sibling. This sentence implies that there are at least three brothers, with Jan Hambourg being in the middle, and Mark Hambourg occupying one of the outer positions. Possible interpretation: There is a family of at least three siblings that includes Jan Hambourg, Mark Hambourg (a famous pianist), and potentially another sibling. Jan Hambourg is the middle brother in this family hierarchy. 2. The second sentence speaks about Mark Hambourg's birth in Voronezh, Russia, and identifies him as the middle brother of the famous pianist Jan Hambourg. This sentence implies that there are at least three siblings, with Mark Hambourg being the middle brother and Jan Hambourg being one of the outer siblings. Possible interpretation: There is a family of at least three siblings that includes Mark Hambourg, Jan Hambourg (a famous pianist), and potentially another sibling. Mark Hambourg is the middle brother in this family hierarchy. In summary, the first sentence places Jan Hambourg as the middle brother with Mark Hambourg being a famous pianist, whereas the second sentence places Mark Hambourg as the middle brother with Jan Hambourg as the famous pianist. The only consistency between the two sentences is that both Jan and Mark Hambourg were born in Voronezh, Russia. It seems that the information in the two sentences contradicts each other in terms of the brothers' positions in the family and who the famous pianist is. To better understand the correct information, one might need to refer to other reliable sources about the Hambourg family and their musical backgrounds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The movie starts by showing what Maggie goes through every day at school. We discover that her best friend Casey (Lily Holleman) is not as unpopular as Maggie is due to her relationship with one of the popular guys. Casey is invited to a party by the boy and accepts the invite on the premise that Maggie is allowed to come as well. The popular boys cringe but don't say anything. At the party Casey is dragged away by her sort of boyfriend, leaving Maggie alone to be laughed at by the preppy click, including Liz (Liz McGeever), a very hated but feared girl at school. Maggie gets food down the front of her shirt and retreats to the kitchen to clean it off (only after being photographed eating in an unflattering manner). From the kitchen she can see Casey and her boyfriend making out in the adjacent hallway before her friend Louis (Fabian C. Moreno) greets her. It is clear that Louis has a thing for Maggie and vice versa. Louis leaves and Casey appears at the same time as Tara (Kimberly Matula) the sweet Queen Bee at school to wipe food off her shirt as well. Tara asks if Maggie is as clutzy as she is which Maggie confirms that she is. After she leaves Casey makes a remark about how Tara is only nice so she can win Homecoming Queen to which Maggie replies that it would be nice if she herself were to win Homecoming Queen and not somebody like Tara or her friends. Liz overhears and decides to nominate Maggie as a joke. The joke is on her though as many students get excited about Maggie being the queen, including Tara, who is, of course, nominated herself.

This adds intrigue and a reasoning to the situation. Step 3: Develop the continuation. In the continuation, we can introduce that the dogs are specially trained service dogs. This provides a reason for selective interaction with a particular person. Step 4: Connect the continuation to the main subject of the text. We connect the explanation by mentioning that Eric is the dogs' handler on the job, emphasizing their training relationship and reason for approaching only him, while not approaching Michael. Final continuation: The dogs ran up to Eric at the airport but not Michael because they were specially trained service dogs, and Eric was their handler on the job."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On a plot of soil, nestled against the backdrop of skyscrapers in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, a group of residents are turning a lack of access to fresh produce into a revival of old traditions and self-empowerment. Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA. HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country. Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville. But the garden serves an even greater purpose. The harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood. \\"It's a reawakening going on. It's almost like it's a renaissance,\\" says Cashawn Myers, director of HABESHA Inc. \\"There's a Ghanaian proverb that says Sankofa. Sankofa means return to your past so you can move forward. Even if you look at coming over here during our enslavement, we were brought here to cultivate the land because that's something we did on the continent. So really, that's what many of the people are doing now,\\" he said.

This solid form of water builds up on the ground as long as the temperatures stay cold enough. As the temperature rises, the snow starts to melt. The frozen water changes state back into a liquid state. Nearer the poles, summer does not last very long. If the summer is long enough and warm enough, all the snow may melt. This is what typically happens now. The earth was a little cooler 12,000 years ago. As a result, during the summer months, that amount of snow did not melt. It may have only been an inch or so of snow that melted. The following winter, snow fell on top of this left-over snow. This next winters snowfall had a head start.

Options are: +yes. +it is not possible to tell. +no. And the answer is:","completion":"It is not possible to tell. To fully understand and evaluate whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must first define what 'entailment' means and then analyze the given premise and hypothesis. Entailment in logic refers to the relationship between two statements where if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. In other words, if we assume the premise to be true, then the validity of the hypothesis is determined by whether or not it logically follows from the premise. Now let us examine the given premise and hypothesis: Premise: Dunkan was there. This statement implies that Dunkan was present at a particular location or event. However, the premise does not offer any specific details about the location or context of \\"there.\\" It simply confirms that Dunkan was indeed present. Hypothesis: Dunkan was in the cave. This statement suggests a more specific location for Dunkan's presence, that being \\"the cave.\\" The hypothesis narrows down Dunkan's location to a particular setting. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we must evaluate whether it is logically necessary for Dunkan's presence in the cave to be true, assuming the premise to be true. In this case, the given premise only tells us that Dunkan was \\"there,\\" but it does not specify where \\"there\\" is. It could be the cave, but it could also be any other location. There is not enough information provided in the premise to conclusively determine whether Dunkan being in the cave is a logical necessity based on the premise.

If I'm darned if I do! , can we conclude that \\"I'll happily do that.\\"?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the phrase \\"darned if I do.\\" The first part of the sentence \\"darned if I do!\\" suggests that the speaker would face some negative consequences or disapproval if they were to go through with an action. Step 2: Consider the context of the statement. The context of the statement is important in determining if \\"I'll happily do that\\" can be concluded from it. If the speaker is using \\"darned if I do!\\" to express sarcasm or frustration, it is unlikely that they would happily go through with the action. On the other hand, if the speaker is using it in a more lighthearted or defiant manner, they might be willing to accept the consequences and complete the task. Step 3: Compare the sentiment of the statements. \\"I'll happily do that\\" is a phrase that typically indicates enthusiasm or willingness to go through with an action. It doesn't usually convey any sense of reluctance or disapproval. Therefore, it doesn't seem to directly correlate with the sentiment of \\"darned if I do!\\". Conclusion: Given the differences in sentiment between the two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"I'll happily do that\\" can be derived from \\"darned if I do!\\".

Are you making a third more that you were last year?Yeah , I thought not . Question: What might be the reason that the gas price went up a third in a year ?","completion":"There are several factors that might contribute to a significant increase in gas prices, as observed in your scenario where the price has gone up by a third in a year. Some of the key reasons include fluctuations in crude oil prices, refinery capacities, production cuts, geopolitical tensions, seasonal demand, exchange rates, natural disasters, government regulations, and taxes. I will elaborate on each of these factors below: 1. Crude oil prices: Gasoline is derived from crude oil, and the price of crude oil is a key factor influencing gas prices. Crude oil prices can be influenced by multiple determinants such as global demand, production levels, and stockpiles. If the global demand for crude oil exceeds its supply, the prices tend to rise. Conversely, if there is an oversupply of crude oil, prices could decrease. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plays a significant role in setting oil production limits, which directly impacts oil prices worldwide. 2. Refinery capacities: Gasoline production and distribution involve a complex process wherein crude oil undergoes refining and transportation to eventually reach consumers. Refineries play a pivotal role in converting crude oil into usable gasoline, and any disruptions in refinery operations can lead to gasoline price hikes. Planned or unplanned maintenance shut-downs, technical issues, or labor strikes can hinder the production and supply of gasoline, causing a surge in prices. 3. Production cuts: Sometimes, oil-producing countries decide to voluntarily cut down their oil output, which decreases the global supply of crude oil. These production cuts can be aimed at stabilizing or increasing oil prices. For instance, OPEC and its allies (OPEC+) have previously agreed to reduce their oil production to balance the oil market and support prices. 4. Geopolitical tensions: Conflicts or disputes between oil-producing nations can disrupt the production and supply of crude oil, causing volatility in prices. For example, wars or economic sanctions can lead to a decline in oil production, pushing up the prices. Additionally, instability in oil-rich regions such as the Middle East can create uncertainty in the global oil market, translating to price fluctuations. 5. Seasonal demand: Gasoline demand typically varies across seasons, affecting the prices accordingly. During warmer months when people travel more frequently, the demand for gasoline increases, consequently leading to a rise in prices. Conversely, demand for gasoline generally drops during colder months, potentially stabilizing or reducing the prices. 6. Exchange rates: Since crude oil is traded in US dollars on international markets, fluctuations in exchange rates can influence gas prices. A stronger US dollar makes oil more expensive for countries using other currencies, which may reduce global demand and lead to lower gas prices. On the other hand, a weaker US dollar can make oil relatively cheaper for these countries, causing higher demand and increasing gas prices. 7. Natural disasters: Hurricanes, earthquakes, or other natural disasters can damage oil production facilities, refineries, or transportation infrastructure, disrupting the supply chain. This can decrease gasoline availability and result in a spike in prices. 8. Government regulations and taxes: Changes in fuel standards, environmental regulations, or taxes can also impact gas prices. Stricter fuel regulations may push up costs for refiners, which in turn leads to higher gasoline prices. Similarly, fluctuations in taxes and levies imposed by federal, state, or local governments can directly affect the retail price of gasoline. In conclusion, gas prices often vary due to a multitude of intertwined factors, ranging from global crude oil markets to local demand and government policies. It's important to keep in mind that the reasons for gas price increases may differ depending on the specific region, time, and circumstances."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given two lists A,B.

The band comprised Boy George (lead vocals), Roy Hay (guitar and keyboards), Mikey Craig (bass guitar) and Jon Moss (drums and percussion). They are considered one of the most representative and influential groups of the 1980s. Culture Club sold more than 50 million albums and 100 million singles (including Boy George solo) records worldwide, including 7 million-records awards RIAA certificate in the United States. Context: The band's second album, Colour by Numbers (UK No. 1, US No. 2), was released in 1983. The first single, \\"Church of the Poison Mind\\", featuring backing vocalist Helen Terry, reached the UK and US Top 10. The second single, \\"Karma Chameleon\\", gave the band their biggest hit, peaking at No. 1 in the UK (the band's second chart-topper there), where it became the best selling single of 1983 and has sold 1.5 million copies there to date. It also peaked at No. 1 in the US for three consecutive weeks, and would ultimately hit No. 1 in 30 countries, thus becoming one of the top twenty best-selling singles of the 1980s sold up 7 million copies worldwide, with one of the most iconic images of Boy George on the cover shot by photographer David Levine. The album Colour by Numbers would spawn more hits including \\"Miss Me Blind\\" (#5 US), \\"It's a Miracle\\" (#4 UK, No. 13 US), and \\"Victims\\" (#3 UK), and sold four million copies in the US and another five million worldwide at its time of release. The album gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group in music history to have an album certified diamond in Canada (for sales of one million copies in that country). The band also won the 1984 Brit Award for Best Group and the Grammy Award for Best New Artist, where George gave a speech via satellite stating, \\"Thanks America, you've got style, you've got taste, and you know a good drag queen when you see one.\\" The group's back-up singer, Helen Terry, began work on her solo album, for which George and Hay wrote the song \\"Love Lies Lost\\". The pair also wrote \\"Passing Friend\\" for the Beach Boys' album. Culture Club wrote two songs for the soundtrack to the movie Electric Dreams. George and Hay wrote \\"The Dream\\" and \\"Love Is Love\\", with the latter being released as a single in Canada and Japan, the E.P \\"Love is Love\\" became a major hit in Japan. George also collaborated on the song \\"Electric Dreams\\", sung by P. P. Arnold. The song was written with Phil Pickett (former member of the 1970s band Sailor) who had also co-written \\"Karma Chameleon\\" and frequently played keyboards for the group. Despite Culture Club's commercial success, there were significant pressures within the band. George was using drugs with money from his new-found fame. George and Moss were also romantically involved with each other, which was unknown to the public and the media at the time. Their relationship lasted for over four years and was often turbulent, with alleged physical and verbal abuse. Their constant arguments and the pressure to hide the relationship from the public started to take its toll on the band. Question: What other singles were there?. Whats the answer?","completion":"In addition to \\"Church of the Poison Mind\\" and \\"Karma Chameleon,\\" the album \\"Colour by Numbers\\" spawned three more hit singles: \\"Miss Me Blind\\" (which reached #5 in the US), \\"It's a Miracle\\" (which peaked at #4 in the UK and #13 in the US), and \\"Victims\\" (which reached #3 in the UK). These singles contributed to the album's immense success and popularity during the 1980s."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Given the background: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc. and the situation: Two scientist, Pete and Gill, studied the Earth's crust and geology. Pete studied earthquakes, while Gill studied mantles and volcanos. Answer the following question: Which person studied less about sediments lying on top of the subducting plate? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background information, Pete, who studied earthquakes, would have studied less about sediments lying on top of the subducting plate when compared to Gill, who studied mantles and volcanoes. The primary reason for this conclusion is that Gill's research topic directly involves the study of subducting plates and their associated sediments. As mentioned in the background, one of the essential factors that contribute to the formation of volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries is the presence of sediments containing water on the subducting plate. These sediments have a significant impact on the process of mantle melting, which ultimately results in the formation of volcanoes in island arcs or continental arcs. Therefore, Gill's research area would require a deep understanding of the role sediments play in mantle melting and volcano formation. In contrast, Pete's research on earthquakes may not delve as deeply into the study of subducting plate sediments. While earthquakes can be associated with plate tectonics, the relationship between sediment study and earthquakes is not as direct as it is for the study of mantles and volcanoes. Earthquakes may occur due to several factors, including a sudden release of stored energy from the Earth's lithosphere, which could be a result of interactions between tectonic plates, but not necessarily related to the sediments on top of a subducting plate. Of course, it is crucial to note that both scientists' research areas would likely touch upon plate tectonics, given that earthquakes and volcanoes are intrinsically linked to the processes occurring within the Earth's crust. However, considering the specific focus on mantle melting and convergent plate boundaries in Gill's area of study, it is safe to conclude that Pete would have studied less about sediments lying on top of the subducting plate in comparison to Gill."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jonkheer Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins (Leeuwarden, Brussels, 1710 – February 26, 1778) was a Frisian courtier at the court of which stadtholder, that was the first hereditary Stadtholder of all the United Provinces? Answer:","completion":"Jonkheer Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins was a Frisian courtier who served at the court of William IV, Prince of Orange-Nassau. William IV (born September 1, 1711, in Leeuwarden and died October 22, 1751, in Huis ten Bosch, The Hague) was the first hereditary Stadtholder of all the United Provinces and was an influential figure during the 18th century. The role of \\"stadtholder\\" was an important position during the Dutch Republic's era and initially referred to a person appointed to help govern a specific region or province. However, over time, the role evolved and became more influential in the governance and administration of the Dutch Republic. During William III's reign (who was also King of England, Scotland, and Ireland), all provinces had synchronized their stadtholderate offices, and William's death in 1702 left an absence in leadership. The absence of a stadtholder throughout the early parts of the 18th century was largely due to the formation of the Second Stadtholderless Period (1702-1747). During this time, the Dutch Republic was led by a regency council primarily composed of provincial elites and influential politicians. The office of stadtholder remained vacant, and the political climate was characterized by power struggles and conflicts among various factions. It was amidst these challenging circumstances that William IV stepped into the role of stadtholder. In 1747, amidst conflict with France during the War of Austrian Succession, the Dutch Republic made the momentous decision to appoint William IV as Stadtholder of all provinces, making him the first hereditary Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic. The change shifted power dynamics in the Dutch Republic, and the Dutch people hoped that a single, strong leader could help them navigate and eventually overcome the ongoing challenges and threats they faced. Under William IV's leadership, the Dutch Republic managed to maintain its independence and integrity despite the external pressures they faced. Although he passed away relatively young at the age of 40, his lineage carried on in his children, most notably William V, who succeeded him as Stadtholder. The House of Orange-Nassau ultimately played a pivotal role not only in the history of the Dutch Republic but also in the formation of the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands. In summary, Jonkheer Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins served as a courtier at the court of William IV, Prince of Orange-Nassau, who was the first hereditary Stadtholder of all the United Provinces in the Dutch Republic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first question is asking for a list of some of the best jokes, implying that the inquirer wants to hear multiple jokes that have been well received or considered good. It's an invitation to share a variety of jokes that have been judged to be amusing, funny, or witty in some form. It's a broad and open-ended question leaving space for a more diverse and subjective range of outstanding or notable jokes depending on the humor preference of the responder. For example, someone might find slapstick humor hilarious while others may prefer sarcastic humor, puns, or dry wit. The second question is asking for the single best joke ever heard. Here, the emphasis is on identifying the absolute best, the one joke that stands out above all others. It's more exclusive and specific, demanding a definitive answer.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system.

Article: Despite such deterrents to armed confrontation, oil and foreign policy analysts say a miscalculation is possible that could cause an overreaction from one side or the other. “I fear we may be blundering toward a crisis nobody wants,” said Helima Croft, senior geopolitical strategist at Barclays Capital. “There is a peril of engaging in brinkmanship from all sides.” Various Iranian officials in recent weeks have said they would blockade the strait, which is only 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, if the United States and Europe imposed a tight oil embargo on their country in an effort to thwart its development of nuclear weapons. That did not stop President Obama from signing legislation last weekend imposing sanctions against Iran’s Central Bank intended to make it more difficult for the country to sell its oil, nor did it dissuade the European Union from moving toward a ban on Iranian oil imports. Energy analysts say even a partial blockage of the Strait of Hormuz could raise the world price of oil within days by 50 a barrel or more, and that would quickly push the price of a gallon of regular gasoline to well over 4 a gallon. “You would get an international reaction that would not only be high, but irrationally high,” said Lawrence J. Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation. Just the threat of such a development has helped keep oil prices above 100 a barrel in recent weeks despite a return of Libyan oil to world markets, worries of a European economic downturn and weakening American gasoline demand. Oil prices rose slightly on Wednesday as the political tensions intensified. American officials have warned Iran against violating international laws that protect commercial shipping in international waters, adding that the Navy would guarantee free sea traffic.

Goldwyn, former State Department coordinator for international energy affairs. “We would take out their frigates.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story More than 85 percent of the oil and most of the natural gas that flows through the strait goes to China, Japan, India, South Korea and other Asian nations. But a blockade would have a ripple effect on global oil prices. Since Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates all rely on the strait to ship their oil and natural gas exports, a blockade might undermine some of those governments in an already unstable region. Analysts say that a crisis over the Strait of Hormuz would most likely bring China and the United States into something of an alliance to restore shipments, although Mr. Goldwyn said China would more likely resort to private diplomacy instead of military force. Europe and the United States would probably feel the least direct impact because they have strategic oil reserves and could get some Persian Gulf oil through Red Sea pipelines. Saudi Arabia has pipelines that could transport about five million barrels out of the region, while Iraq and the United Arab Emirates also have pipelines with large capacities. But transportation costs would be higher if the strait were blocked, and several million barrels of oil exports would remain stranded, sending energy prices soaring on global markets. “To close the Strait of Hormuz would be an act of war against the whole world,” said Sadad Ibrahim Al-Husseini, former head of exploration and development at Saudi Aramco. “You just can’t play with the global economy and assume that nobody is going to react.” The Iranians have struck in the strait before. In the 1980s, Iran attacked Kuwaiti tankers carrying Iraqi oil, and the Reagan administration reflagged Kuwaiti ships under American flags and escorted them with American warships. Iran backed down, partially, but continued to plant mines. In 1988, an American frigate hit an Iranian mine and nearly sank. United States warships retaliated by destroying some Iranian oil platforms. Attacks and counterattacks continued for months, and a missile from an American warship accidentally shot down an Iranian passenger aircraft, killing 290 passengers. Energy experts say a crisis in the strait would most likely unfold gradually, with Iran using its threats as a way to increase oil prices and shipping costs for the West as retaliation against the tightening of sanctions. So far, energy experts say, insurance companies have not raised prices for covering tankers, but shipping companies are already preparing to pay bonuses for crews facing more hazardous duties. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “My guess is this is a lot of threats,” said Michael A. Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, “but there is no certainty in this kind of situation.” ||||| LONDON (Reuters) - Should Iran's rulers ever make good their threats to block the Straits of Hormuz, they could almost certainly achieve their aim within a matter of hours. But they could also find themselves sparking a punishing -- if perhaps short-lived -- regional conflict from which they could emerge the primary losers. In recent weeks, a growing number of senior Iranian military and civilian officials have warned that Tehran could use force to close the 54 km (25 mile) entrance to the Gulf if Western states impose sanctions that paralyze their oil exports. In 10 days of highly publicized military exercises, state television showed truck-mounted missiles blasting towards international waters, fast gunboats practicing attacks and helicopters deploying divers and naval commandos. Few believe Tehran could keep the straits closed for long -- perhaps no more than a handful of days -- but that alone would still temporarily block shipment of a fifth of all traded global oil, sending prices rocketing and severely denting hopes of global economic recovery. But such action would swiftly trigger retaliation from the United States and others that could leave the Islamic republic militarily and economically crippled. \\"They can cause a great deal of mischief... but it depends how much pain they are willing to accept,\\" says Nikolas Gvosdev, professor of national security studies at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island. He said he believed Tehran would only take such action as a last resort: \\"They are much more likely to threaten than to act.\\" The true purpose of its recent saber-rattling, many analysts suspect, may be more a mixture of deterring foreign powers from new sanctions and distracting voters from rising domestic woes ahead of legislative elections in March. With the United States signing new sanctions into law on New Year's Eve -- although they will not enter force until the middle of the year -- and the European Union considering similar steps, few expect the pressure on Tehran to let up. \\"This is probably less a genuine military threat than a bid to put economic pressure back on the West and split Western powers over sanctions that threaten Iran's oil economy,\\" says Henry Wilkinson, head of intelligence and analysis at London security consultants Janusian. \\"Iran now does not have much to lose by making such a threat and a lot to gain.\\" But many fear the more Iran is pushed into a corner, the greater the risk of miscalculation. Its ruling establishment is also widely seen as deeply divided, with some elements -- particularly the well-equipped and hardline Revolutionary Guard -- much keener on confrontation than others. SEA MINES, MISSILES, SUBMARINES, SPEEDBOATS \\"I cannot see strategic sense in closing the straits, but then I do not understand the Iranian version of the 'rational actor',\\" said one senior Western naval officer on condition of anonymity. \\"(But) one can be pretty certain that they will misjudge the Western reaction... They clearly find us as hard to read as we find them.\\" The capability to wreak at least temporary chaos, however, is unquestionably there. The U.S. Fifth Fleet always keeps one or two aircraft carrier battle groups either in the Gulf or within striking distance in the Indian Ocean. Keenly aware of conventional U.S. military dominance in the region, Iran has adopted what strategists describe as an \\"asymmetric\\" approach. Missiles mounted on civilian trucks can be concealed around the coastline, tiny civilian dhows and fishing vessels can be used to lay mines, and midget submarines can be hidden in the shallows to launch more sophisticated \\"smart mines\\" and homing torpedoes. Iran is also believed to have built up fleets of perhaps hundreds of small fast attack craft including tiny suicide speedboats, learning from the example of Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels who used such methods in a war with the government. At worst, its forces could strike simultaneously at multiple ships passing out of the Gulf, leaving a string of burning tankers and perhaps also Western warships. But a more likely initial scenario, many experts believe, is that it would simply declare a blockade, perhaps fire warning shots at ships and announce it had laid a minefield. \\"All the Iranians have to do is say they mined the straight and all tanker traffic would cease immediately,\\" says Jon Rosamund, head of the maritime desk at specialist publishers and consultancy IHS Jane's. RETALIATION, ESCALATION U.S. and other military forces would find themselves swiftly pushed by shippers and consumers to force a route through with minesweepers and other warships -- effectively daring Tehran to fire or be revealed to have made an empty threat. During the so-called \\"tanker war\\" of the mid-1980s, Gulf waters were periodically mined as Iran and Iraq attacked each other's oil shipments. U.S., British and other foreign forces responded by escorting other nations' tankers -- as well as conducting limited strikes on Iranian maritime targets. This time, retaliation could go much further. In closing the straits, Tehran would have committed an act of war and that might prove simply too tempting an opportunity for its foes to pass up. \\"We might well take the opportunity to take out their entire defense system,\\" said veteran former U.S. intelligence official Anthony Cordesman, now Burke Chair of Strategy at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. \\"You'd almost certainly also see serious strikes on their nuclear facilities. Once the Iranians have initiated hostilities, there is no set level at which you have to stop escalation.\\" Whilst in theory it would be possible to push heavily protected convoys through the straits even in the face of Iranian attack, few believe shippers or insurers would have the appetite for the level of casualties that could involve. Instead, they would probably hold back until Tehran's military had been sufficiently degraded. That, Western military officers confidently say, would only be a matter of time. \\"Anti-ship cruise missiles are mobile, yet can... be found and destroyed,\\" said one U.S. naval officer with considerable experience in the region, speaking on condition of anonymity. \\"Submarines are short-duration threats -- they eventually have to come to port for resupply and when they do they will be sitting ducks.\\" \\"DANGEROUS GAME OF CHICKEN\\" Given the forces arrayed against them, many analysts believe Tehran will ultimately keep the straits open -- not least to allow their own oil exports to flow -- whilst finding other ways to needle its foes. If they did wish to disrupt shipping, they could briefly close off areas of the Gulf through declaring \\"military exercise areas,\\" \\"accidentally\\" release oil into the main channel or perhaps launch one-off and more deniable hit-and-run attacks. The rhetoric, however, looks almost certain to continue. \\"This isn't the first time we have heard these types of threats,\\" said Alan Fraser, Middle East analyst for London-based risk consultancy AKE. \\"Closing of the Straits of Hormuz is the perfect issue to talk about because the stakes are potentially so high that nobody wants it to happen.\\" Henry Smith, Middle East analyst at consultancy Control Risks, says he believes the only circumstances under which the Iranians would consider such action would be if the United States or Israel had already launched an overt military strike on nuclear facilities. \\"Then, I think it would happen pretty much automatically,\\" he said. \\"The Iranians have been saying for a long time that is an option, and they would have little choice but to stick to that. But otherwise, I think it's very unlikely.\\" For many long-term watchers of the region, the real risk remains that in playing largely to domestic audiences, policymakers in Washington, Tel Aviv and Tehran inadvertently spark something much worse than they ever intended. \\"Both sides are talking tough,\\" said Farhang Jahanpour, associate fellow at the Faculty of Oriental Studies at Oxford University. \\"Unfortunately it can very easily get out of hand and cause a conflagration. I blame hardliners on both sides. They are playing a very dangerous game of chicken.\\" (Additional reporting by William Maclean) (Reporting By Peter Apps; Edited by Richard Meares) |||||Summary:","completion":"People are worried because some leaders from a country called Iran have said they might block a very important place where ships carrying oil pass through. This place is called the Strait of Hormuz. If they block this place, it will become difficult for many countries to get oil, making the price of oil very high and causing lots of problems. Other countries like the United States and countries in Europe have said that they won't let Iran block the Strait of Hormuz.

Some of the sounds he captured have a very high frequency and others are very low frequency. When he is done he begins to edit the sound with a computer program. and a hint : Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is Please answer this question : Do the high frequency sounds have a longer or shorter wavelength than the low frequency sounds? Answer:","completion":"The high frequency sounds have a shorter wavelength than the low frequency sounds. This is because frequency and wavelength are inversely related as per the concept of wave physics. When the frequency of a wave increases, the wavelength decreases, and vice versa. This relationship can be summarized with the equation: Speed of Wave = Wavelength x Frequency. Hence, if the frequency is high (as in the case of high frequency sounds that Bill captured), the wavelength will be shorter.

Expand this summary.","completion":"US President-elect Donald Trump's unorthodox approach to communicating with world leaders has been causing concern amongst US and world diplomats. His inclination to pick up the phone and speak with heads of state, often without preparation and using personal phone lines, has led some to worry about the potential safety implications of his actions. For instance, his recent call with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif led to what White House press secretary Josh Earnest deemed as \\"quite complicated\\" relationship between the two countries. The New York Times notes that the Pakistani readout of the conversation between Trump and Sharif raised concerns among some Washington DC diplomats who thought it was a joke. This is particularly disconcerting considering the fragile and complex relationship between Pakistan and the United States, as well as the fact that Pakistan is a nuclear-armed country. Daniel F. Feldman, a former special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, warns that Trump's \\"cavalier\\" approach to these calls could potentially be dangerous, especially when dealing with nuclear-armed regions. He states, \\"He's made himself not only a bull in a china shop, but a bull in a nuclear china shop.\\" The White House has been offering assistance to help Trump navigate these delicate communications. As Earnest says, \\"I'm confident that as ... Trump takes office, those same State Department employees [who helped Obama] will stand ready to offer him advice as he conducts the business of the United States overseas.\\" He adds, \\"Hopefully he'll take it.\\" In contrast, President Obama has been far more cautious in his dealings with Pakistan, which is a country he has never visited as president. He has taken diplomatic measures and executed a carefully planned strategy in order to protect US interests in the volatile region. As an unconventional president, it is not unexpected that Donald Trump would deviate from established protocol when it comes to engaging with world leaders. However, his seemingly impulsive and casual approach to dealing with foreign heads of state poses potential risks to the diplomatic relations and global security. While his intentions may be well-meaning and aimed at establishing personal relationships with other world leaders, the implications of such behavior need to be carefully considered. In order to ensure the stability and safety of the United States and its allies, it is important for the president-elect to cooperate with experienced diplomats and receive valuable guidance on how to navigate these complex communications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cameron gave Carson his shirt back after washing it twice but still the stain didn't come out. Given the question \\"How would Cameron feel afterwards?\\", is \\"bad about the stain\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, \\"bad about the stain\\" is a valid answer in this scenario, as it captures the potential emotions that Cameron might be experiencing after having tried to remove the stain and failing. However, it might not cover the whole range of emotions Cameron may be feeling, and other factors might also play a role in shaping Cameron's emotional state. When considering how Cameron may feel, it is important to take into account several aspects of the situation: the relationship between Cameron and Carson, the significance of the shirt, the nature of the incident that caused the stain, and Cameron's efforts already made to fix the problem. Cameron's effort in washing the shirt twice demonstrates concern and responsibility, likely feeling that he should fix the problem since he borrowed the shirt. This shows that he values the friendship with Carson and wants to maintain a good relationship. Despite his genuine attempts, the stain remained. Hence, Cameron would understandably feel bad or guilty about it, as he couldn't meet his own expectations or potentially Carson's. Additionally, understanding the significance of the shirt to Carson could also impact Cameron's emotions. If the shirt was expensive or held sentimental value, Cameron might feel even worse about the situation, as he might have caused more harm than expected. Alternatively, if the shirt was just a regular, everyday item, Cameron's feelings of guilt or disappointment could be somewhat mitigated, as the damage done is limited. Lastly, it is crucial to consider the nature of the incident that led to the staining. If Cameron is responsible for the stain, either through carelessness or accident, he would likely feel more guilt and responsibility towards remedying the situation. If the stain was caused by uncontrollable circumstances or factors outside Cameron's control, he might still feel bad about it, but his emotions may be tempered by the understanding that it wasn't his fault. Considering all these factors, it can be concluded that \\"bad about the stain\\" is a valid answer, but it is also valuable to recognize that Cameron's emotional response could be a complex mix of guilt, disappointment, embarrassment, and even concern for his friendship with Carson. These feelings can emerge from his inability to fully restore the borrowed shirt, the significance of the shirt to Carson, and the circumstances leading to the stain."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This big trick taught him an important lesson about not easily believing everything he sees or hears, just like we shouldn't believe in scary monsters hiding under our beds. Surprising everyone again, he said that he was able to trick even the big news sources, which is like being the best at hide and seek. He also took the time to say thank you to his friends who supported him, even though his big adventure turned out to be nothing more than a silly prank, like pretending to have a pet dragon. He had a message for those who have unique and special names that might sound funny or strange to others. He said they shouldn't be upset by anyone who tries to tease them, but they should keep on being the best they can be. In the end, Joe's prankful adventure was nothing more than a wake-up call, reminding everyone to think twice and double check before believing in things, especially if they seem a bit too silly or strange!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The statement discusses the general nature of Japanese control over China during World War II, but it does not provide specific information on the city where Japan established a provisional capital. To answer the question, we need to provide relevant information on the establishment of a provisional capital in China by Japan. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), Japan set up a provisional capital in the city of Nanjing (also spelled Nanking), after capturing it in December 1937. This city served as the capital of the puppet regime known as the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China, led by Wang Jingwei. The Japanese occupation of Nanjing is often associated with the infamous \\"Nanjing Massacre\\" or \\"Rape of Nanking,\\" in which tens of thousands of Chinese civilians and soldiers were killed, and numerous atrocities were committed by the invading Japanese forces. The establishment of the puppet regime in Nanjing was an attempt by Japan to legitimize their rule in occupied China and undermine the Chinese resistance led by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government, which had relocated its capital to Chongqing following the fall of Nanjing. So, to answer the question: Japan set up a provisional capital in the city of Nanjing, during their occupation of China in the Second Sino-Japanese War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sollecito and new squeeze Greta Menagaldo were seen on the property Thursday evening despite the badboy being found guilty of murder and being sentenced to 25 years in prison, according to The Local. Sollecito is free while his verdict is being appealed, and was most recently found suspiciously at a hotel on the country’s border with Austria, according to reports. Visitors: Raffaele Sollecito (left) and Greta Menagaldo (right) visited the home this week. The questionable move surely outraged many, including one local who told the paper he ‘couldn’t believe it. When I saw them up close, it was Sollecito,’ the man insisted. The convicted killer’s father saw nothing wrong with the brazen visit. ‘If Raffaele wanted to show his girlfriend the ordeal he went through, I can't see anything wrong with that,’ Sollecito’s father told the paper. He further insisted that his twice-convicted son ‘has absolutely nothing to do with that crime.’ Also found guilty: Amanda Knox shown during a 2011 court hearing. Killed: Meredith Kercher was found stabbed to death in the home. Where it happened: The Perugia home where Kercher was found dead. The Italian and American exchange student Amanda Knox were convicted of murder in a sensational trial of killing Kercher along with bartender Rudy Guede. Knox was set free on appeal and fled to the United States vowing not return no matter the outcome of her appeal. ‘Foxy Knoxy,’ as the press referred to her, faces 28 years and six months behind bars.

Subject: A bluetooth wireless speaker Negative Review Example: I recently purchased the XYZ Bluetooth Wireless Speaker, and I am disappointed with my experience. Firstly, the battery life is extremely underwhelming. The product description promised up to 8 hours of continuous playtime, but in reality, I struggled to get even 4 hours of usage on a full charge. This is incredibly inconvenient, especially during outdoor gatherings or trips where access to a power source might be limited. Secondly, the sound quality is inconsistent. Although it boasts a high level of clarity and richness in audio, there are times when the bass is overpowering and causes the entire speaker to vibrate excessively. Additionally, the audio occasionally crackles when playing music at higher volumes. These issues significantly impact the overall listening experience. Lastly, the Bluetooth connectivity keeps dropping, and setting up the connection with my phone has been a challenge, requiring multiple attempts. This frustration detracts from the ease-of-use that this wireless speaker is supposed to offer. While the XYZ Wireless Speaker has an attractive design and water-resistant capability, the poor battery life, subpar sound quality, and connectivity issues make it difficult for me to recommend this product. I hope the manufacturer addresses these concerns in future iterations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Translate to English","completion":"The prevention and treatment of infectious diseases at an early stage form the basis of medical care for HIV-positive or undiagnosed children living in low-income countries where there is no access to antiretroviral drugs. Infectious diseases pose a significant threat to children, particularly those who are HIV-positive or have not yet been diagnosed due to limited resources and access to healthcare in low-income countries. Early prevention and treatment of these diseases are crucial to ensure the health and well-being of these vulnerable children. Prevention measures include: 1. Immunization programs: Children, especially those at risk for HIV, should receive vaccinations for common infectious diseases such as measles, polio, and tuberculosis to minimize the risk of acquiring these diseases. 2. Sanitation and hygiene promotion: Access to clean water, proper sanitation, and hygiene education are vital to preventing the spread of various infections among children living in low-income countries. 3. Insecticide-treated bed nets: The provision of insecticide-treated bed nets can help protect children from malaria, a mosquito-borne disease that poses a significant threat to those living in tropical regions. 4. Awareness campaigns and community mobilization: Educating communities about the importance of disease prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment can help reduce the spread of infectious diseases among children in low-resource settings. 5. Access to healthcare services: Ensuring that children have access to healthcare professionals for regular check-ups, disease prevention, and treatment is crucial for early detection and management of infections. For treating infectious diseases at an early stage, the following steps can be taken: 1. Prompt diagnosis and treatment: Early detection of infections through regular check-ups, blood tests, and diagnostic tools can help ensure timely and appropriate treatment. 2. Antibiotics and antiviral medications: Depending on the type of infection, various medications can be prescribed to help combat the infection and prevent its progression. 3. Nutritional support: Good nutrition is vital for maintaining a healthy immune system, which is crucial in fighting off infections. Children with poor nutrition may be at a higher risk of contracting diseases and require additional support to ensure they have adequate nutrients and calories. 4. Management of co-infections: Children with HIV are more susceptible to other infections, necessitating regular monitoring and appropriate treatment for co-existing infections. 5. Psychological support and counseling: Children infected with HIV or facing a high risk of infection may require psychological support and counseling to cope with their condition and to ensure adherence to treatment plans. In conclusion, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases at an early stage are crucial for safeguarding the health of HIV-positive or undiagnosed children living in low-income countries. By employing a combination of prevention measures, access to healthcare services, and comprehensive treatment strategies, the medical community can reduce the impact of infectious diseases on vulnerable populations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the album \\"Autumn Almanac\\" was on? The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - ESPNU is an American digital cable and satellite sports television channel that is owned by ESPN Inc., a joint venture between the DisneyABC Television Group division of The Walt Disney Company (which owns a controlling 80% stake) and the Hearst Corporation (which owns the remaining 20%).

Opposition fail to get Syria Arab League seat The opposition Syrian National Council (SNC) has made only marginal gains at a meeting of the Arab League, despite two days of intense lobbying. The 22-memberÂ summit, which concluded in Kuwait City on Wednesday, decided to allow the SNC to participate in ministerial meetings on an \\"exceptional basis\\". But the league stopped short on Wednesday of granting the group the official recognition it sought to be Syria's sole legitimate representative. Nor did the body accede to SNC requests for weapons to be sent to rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. Nabil al-Araby, the league's general-secretary, said Syria's seat had been kept empty during the summit because \\"the SNC is not a government and council seats are for governments\\".Â He said this was the reason he \\"was against giving the SNC a seat\\" at last year's League meeting in Cairo. Louay Safi, a spokesman for the SNC,Â appeared to confirm reports that Egypt had aligned itself with Algeria, Lebanon and Iraq in rejecting the handover of Syrian representation to the SNC. \\"Egypt had reservations,\\" he told Al Jazeera. Safi told reporters: \\"We are surprised that Nabil al-Araby is still trying to reach a decision in a way that is not positive but we are not going to come to any conclusions.\\" On Tuesday, Ahmad al-Jarba,Â the head of the SNC, criticised theÂ Arab Leagueâs decision to keep the seat empty, saying it was a message to Assad that \\"he can kill, and that the seat will wait for him to resolve his war\\". Al Jazeera reported earlier that Lebanon had threatened to pull out of the summit if the SNC were granted the Syria seat. The Lebanese finance minister tweeted during the opening session that he stormed out of the session during Jarba's speech \\"in line with his convictions and principles\\". Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar ZebariÂ disagreed with the access granted to the SNC, telling Reuters news agency:Â \\"Where is their sovereignty? Where is their authority?Â They are not a state, they don't have aÂ government even.\\" Following the declaration, Safi said: \\"The decisions of the summit are not against the opposition - they maintained recognition of the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people.\\"According to a declaration issued following the summit, theÂ bloc condemnedÂ the \\"mass killing\\" by the Syrian government, insisting that a political solution to the three-year civil war remained a priority. The summit did not explicitly address the diplomatic row between Qatar and its Gulf neighbours. Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain withdrew their envoys from Doha \\"to protect their security and stability\\".Â Â The next Arab League Summit is due to be held next spring in Egypt.Â Additional reporting by Dahlia Kholaif and Jassim MaterÂ in Kuwait City. Source:Â Al Jazeera and agencies What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The Syrian National Council (SNC), Syria's opposition group, failed to gain the official recognition it sought as Syria's sole legitimate representative during a meeting of the Arab League. The summit in Kuwait City, involving 22 Arab League members, decided to allow the SNC to participate in ministerial meetings on an 'exceptional basis' without granting them an official seat. The league also denied SNC's request for weapons to be sent to rebels fighting against President Bashar al-Assad. This decision was due to the principle that council seats are reserved for governments, which the SNC is not. Furthermore, it appears that countries such as Egypt, Algeria, Lebanon, and Iraq rejected the idea of handing over Syrian representation to the SNC. The situation regarding Syria's seat in the Arab League will remain open for further decisions in future summits."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Usage: We should read the text and find out who or what the pronoun \\"she\\" is referring to: \\"Jacky has purchased a ship, the Lorelei Lee, with the Spanish gold _she_ recovered from the Caribbean sea.\\" In this case, \\"she\\" is referring to Jacky, as Jacky is the one who recovered the Spanish gold from the Caribbean sea and bought the ship Lorelei Lee. This meets the criteria because we have determined the correct reference for the pronoun based on the context. Part #4: Classify the answer based on the pronoun's reference. Usage: Since we have determined that \\"she\\" refers to Jacky in the text, we can now classify the answer as A.

The group released its first extended play, Back In 2006 Hilltop Hoods were nominated for five ARIA Awards - the first ever for an Australian hip hop group - winning in two categories: 'Best Urban Release' and 'Best Independent Release'. The following year they won 'Best Urban Release' at the ARIA Awards for The Hard Road: Restrung. The album was also nominated for 'Best Independent Release' and 'Best Cover Art' by John Engelhardt. The DVD City of Light was nominated as 'Best Music DVD' at the 2008 ARIA awards. At the 2009 ARIA Awards they won 'Best Urban Album' for a third time - for State of the Art and DJ Debris won an award for 'Engineer of the Year' for his work on that album.

He will roll more quickly over the wood floor because it has (A) more friction (B) less friction.","completion":"Carl will roll more quickly over the wood floor because it has (B) less friction. Both wood floors and shag carpets provide frictional forces between the rollerblades and the surface; however, the amount of friction depends on the characteristics of each surface. Friction is a resistive force that opposes the motion of objects moving against each other. Wood floors have a smooth surface which results in relatively lower friction as compared to shag carpets. The rough and dense nature of shag carpets creates more friction as the fibers of the carpet work against the wheels of rollerblades, making it harder for Carl to maintain speed or motion without more applied force. On a wood floor, the lower friction allows Carl to glide with less effort and makes it easier for him to roll more quickly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Help as much as you can. In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\" \\"Hope you're keepin' him closer.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Keep him at a far distance.\\" is true?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis \\"Keep him at a far distance\\" is true based on the premise \\"Hope you're keepin' him closer,\\" we need to analyze the context, tone, and intention of the given statement and contrast it with the proposed hypothesis. Let us break down both the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"Hope you're keepin' him closer.\\" The statement appears to be a message or an advice given to someone, likely about their relationship with another individual. The word \\"closer\\" indicates a desire for the person to develop a stronger bond, relationship, or connection with the person being mentioned. The tone of this statement is optimistic and encouraging, as it indicates hope for an improved or maintained relationship. Hypothesis: \\"Keep him at a far distance.\\" The hypothesis is contradictory to the premise. It suggests that instead of keeping the person closer, one should maintain a greater physical or emotional distance from this individual. The tone of this statement is more cautionary and protective, which implies a sense of being careful, possibly due to potential negative consequences or risks associated with being too close to the person in question. Now let us compare the premise and hypothesis and analyze whether the hypothesis is true based on the given premise. As discussed earlier, the premise \\"Hope you're keepin' him closer\\" indicates a desire for the person to develop a stronger bond or relationship with someone. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"Keep him at a far distance\\" suggests maintaining a greater distance and a lesser connection with the person in question. Based on the given premise, it is clear that the intention is to develop a closer relationship or bond with the individual rather than to keep him at a farther distance. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Keep him at a far distance\\" is true based on the premise \\"Hope you're keepin' him closer.\\" It is essential to remember that the conclusion depends on the specific context of the situation, as well as the motivations and intentions of the people involved. Factors such as the nature of their relationship, trust level between the individuals, and past experiences can play a significant role in determining the most appropriate advice or course of action. In conclusion, since the premise encourages keeping the person closer, and the hypothesis proposes the opposite, we cannot confirm that the hypothesis \\"Keep him at a far distance\\" is true based on the given premise."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Both versions express the idea that the given amount or value is not the amount paid by the concerned party. To provide a clearer understanding, let us consider a scenario. Imagine we are discussing salaries for a particular job, where the expected salary for an employee is 75,000 per year. However, we learned that the company is, in fact, paying 65,000 per year. In this context, we can say, \\"and that's not what they're paying,\\" or \\"that is not what they are paying.\\" Both phrases mean that the company is not paying the expected salary but rather a different amount. This conclusion can be used in various contexts, such as discussing pricing for products, services, or comparing the cost of living in different areas. In any case, the key point of the statement is that there is a discrepancy between the expected payment and the actual payment. It may lead to further discussions about the reasons behind this difference and the possible implications or consequences arising from this situation. For instance, an individual may re-evaluate their decision to join a company if the offered salary is not what they were expecting or what is prevalent in the industry.

In conclusion, if you encounter the phrase \\"and that's not what they're paying,\\" or \\"that is not what they are paying,\\" it indicates that there is a difference between the expected payment and the actual payment.

In this context, the \\"eyes\\" of a potato are not actually eyes used for vision but refer to the small indentations or growth points found on the surface of a potato.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Horribly Slow Murderer with the Extremely Inefficient Weapon Context: The movie itself is presented as being a trailer for a 9 hour long movie. It starts with a voice-over, telling the viewer that: \\"some murders take seconds; some murders take minutes; some murders take hours; this murder... will take years!\\". The movie portrays the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; \\"cucchiaio\\" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No-one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone. He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack's surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon. However, in this scene Jack also notices a strange sign on the arm of his attacker. Jack travels to the far East where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji, (\\"Silver spoon\\" in Japanese), an immortal and unstoppable being. After this, Jack is shown traveling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again. The last scene shows a weakened, wounded Jack, crawling in the desert, with the Ginosaji still striking him with the spoon. Then, suddenly, the spoon breaks. However, Jack's final hope is brief as the Ginosaji opens his jacket and shows dozens of spoons. Finally, the title and credits are shown in typical trailer style.

Overjoyed by this social coup, Millicent is oblivious to Oliver's lack of enthusiasm about the dinner and her daughter Paula's (Madge Evans) preoccupation about the impending return of her fiancÃ©, Ernest DeGraff (Phillips Holmes), from Europe.

Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A man operating some heavy machinery.\\", is the sentence \\"Someone is operating a welder.\\" a true sentence? Choices: --yes; --it is not possible to tell; --no;","completion":"Based on the sentence \\"A man operating some heavy machinery,\\" it is not possible to tell if \\"Someone is operating a welder\\" is a true sentence. Here's why: The original sentence mentions that a man is operating heavy machinery. Heavy machinery can refer to a wide range of large, industrial equipment such as cranes, bulldozers, excavators, forklifts, and more. However, it does not explicitly specify the type of heavy machinery being operated. A welder is a piece of equipment used for joining materials, particularly metal, by heating the surfaces to their melting point and using a filler material to form a pool of molten material that eventually cools to become a strong joint. Although welding might be considered a form of heavy machinery, the original statement does not provide enough information about the specific equipment being operated by the man. Hence, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"Someone is operating a welder\\" based on the information provided in the original sentence.

Background: Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [ka:l 'nelsn]; 9 June 1865 - 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor but musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. Context: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre. Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Sovnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life. Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate daughter was born - Rachel Siegmann, about whom Anne Marie never learned. With his wife Nielsen had two daughters and a son. Irmelin, the elder daughter, studied music theory with her father and in December 1919 married Eggert Moller (1893-1978), a medical doctor who became a professor at the University of Copenhagen and director of the polyclinic at the National Hospital. The younger daughter Anne Marie, who graduated from the Copenhagen Academy of Arts, married the Hungarian violinist Emil Telmanyi (1892-1988) in 1918; he contributed to the promotion of Nielsen's music, both as a violinist and a conductor. Nielsen's son, Hans Borge, was handicapped as a result of meningitis and spent most of his life away from the family. He died near Kolding in 1956. Question: When did Carl Nielsen get married?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Carl Nielsen got married to Anne Marie Brodersen on 10 May 1891. They were both Danish artists and got married in St. Mark's English Church in Florence, Italy, before returning to Denmark.

This organization does not give away free clothes or sell clothes for money. Instead, GOONJ asks people to work to help the community. In return, GOONJ supplies people with clothes. Suhklal said the experience made him happy. He felt proud of his work and his new clothes. In 1998, Anshu Gupta and his wife wanted to help the people affected by a crisis , so they gathered all the clothes they had not worn. Looking at their gathered clothing, they wanted to start a new clothing organization. But they wanted their organization to be different from others. They wanted to collect clothing all year round -- not just in times of crisis. And more importantly, they wanted to serve people in a way that made them feel proud when receiving clothes. GOONJ makes sure the clothing is given to people who can use it. For example, people in areas with cooler temperatures receive warmer clothes. And people in villages that wear traditional clothing would receive traditional clothing. GOONJ also reuses clothes that people can't wear. For example, a shirt with holes can be made into a bag or used to make a blanket. GOONJ helps organize projects that improve the community. People receive clothes in return for their community work. Gupta believes this helps the receivers build self-respect, because they have earned the clothes. It also helps the receivers to be proud of what they have done to help their community.

Input: Question: If Jim is transmitting electricity through a wire and he reduces the size of that wire, the electrons move through it Answer: harder Output:","completion":"Explanation: When Jim reduces the size of the wire through which he is transmitting electricity, the cross-sectional area of the wire decreases. As a result, the same amount of current (electrons) moving through the wire will have less space to travel. This causes the electrons to experience greater resistance in their movement, making it \\"harder\\" for them to travel through the reduced-size wire. The increased resistance generated due to the smaller wire size leads to more energy loss in the form of heat, which can also decrease the overall efficiency of the electrical circuit. In summary, reducing the size of a wire through which electricity is being transmitted will make it harder for electrons to move through it due to the increased resistance encountered in the smaller cross-sectional area, resulting in less efficient energy transmission and potentially more energy lost as heat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dilution: Dilution refers to increasing the ratio of solvent to solute in a solution, which may affect the melting point but is not directly related to decreasing it. 2. Impurities: Adding impurities, such as salts, can decrease the melting point of a liquid by disrupting the regular arrangement of the molecules, making it more difficult for them to form a solid structure. This is relevant to our example of adding salt to a liquid. 3. Water expanding: Water expanding is related to the unique property of water that it expands on freezing, but it doesn't directly affect the melting point. 4. Dehydration: Dehydration is the removal of water from a substance, which is not directly related to decreasing the melting point of a liquid. 5.

Tatianna's aesthetic was drawn towards the grand and the exquisite, which was evident from her preference for the statue over the lamp. The statue was so fancy, capturing the magnificence of bygone eras with such precision, that it was easy to understand why Tatianna was enamored by it. Carved from pure marble, the statue exuded a regal charm, reflecting the craftsmanship of a time when detail and grandeur were the defining features of art. It stood at a majestic six feet, delivering an aura of otherworldly beauty, featuring the Greek goddess Athena draped in flowing robes, clutching her shield and mighty spear. The textures of her garbs and the godly armor bore such intricate detailing that they almost felt real to touch, you could almost feel the weight of her battle tried shield or the sharpness of her trusty spear. Her eyes were made of sapphire, which glittered mysteriously, adding depth to her beauty. The statue managed to command a presence of power and gracefulness, much like the royals of olden times. Its aesthetic textures, regal posturing, and the high-ended artisanship won Tatianna's heart right away. She was entranced by its meticulously carved features and the way they reflected the artists' dedication, love, and respect for the goddess. Tatianna often found herself lost in trying to decipher the secret stories these features held closely, and she found this chase exhilarating. While this was already quite an appealing image, what set the statue apart was its base. It consisted of numerous smaller sculptures depicting scenes from the Greek Goddess' life - her birth from Zeus’s head, the Greek victory over the Persians at Marathon, and other major events that were an integral part of Athenian mythology. Every little figure was sculpted meticulously, with minute detailing bringing them to life, thus adding another dimension to the already marvelous statue. It was not merely a statue for Tatianna but a story etched in stone. On the other hand, the lamp, albeit fancy, lacked that grandeur and romance that stirred a longing in Tatianna's heart. It was an admirable work with its own merits. Yet Tatianna was drawn to the layers of complexity that the statue offered - the intricate design, the narrative it bore, the feeling of timelessness it evoked, and the distinctive royal allure it carried. The self-effacing lamp, despite its fancy make and charm, failed to do so, making Tatianna’s choice more than simple aesthetics. She was willing to immerse herself in the world that the statue promised rather than settle with the contemporary simplicity of the lamp. Hence, Tatianna's love for decadent royalty made her choose the statue over the lamp. The statue, with its grandeur, history, and the stories it held captive, appealed to her love for the arts as well as her desire to surround herself with things that mirrored the opulence of a bygone era. On the other hand, the lamp while fancy and alluring, represented contemporary elegance, and this simply didn't captivate her as much as the magnificence of the statue. The grandeur of the statue presented her a world that she could lose herself into, a world where the echoes of history danced with the whispers of mystery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What can happen to water at different temperatures? - melts - wet clothes - move mountains - thin blood - take several forms The best answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"When evaluating the given options for what can happen to water at different temperatures, it is important to consider the properties of water and how it reacts to temperature changes. Option 1: Melts Water can indeed melt or freeze when experiencing temperature changes. When the temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), water turns into ice. This process is known as freezing. Conversely, when ice reaches a temperature above this point, it melts back into water. Option 2: Wet Clothes Water can wet clothes due to its liquid state. However, this is a property of liquid water at any temperature, rather than a reaction to temperature changes. Option 3: Move Mountains Water can contribute to the movement of mountains through processes such as erosion, but this effect is not directly linked to temperature changes. Erosion involves the slow movement of soil, rock, and other materials due to various natural forces, including the flow of water. Option 4: Thin Blood Water may have an indirect effect on blood viscosity (thickness), but it doesn't actually \\"thin\\" the blood. Proper hydration is essential for maintaining blood volume and helping regulate body temperature. However, this is not a direct consequence of water changing temperature. Option 5: Take Several Forms Water can exist in different forms (or states) depending on the temperature: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor). This is a property directly connected to temperature changes. When the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius, water exists as ice; between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius, it is a liquid; and above 100 degrees Celsius, it changes to water vapor. Therefore, the best answer is: Water can take several forms at different temperatures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jabba the Hutt The answer to this question is:","completion":"Step 1: Establish the setting To begin constructing the movie plot, it's essential to set the stage. We'll establish the setting in a galaxy far, far away, filled with various planets, creatures, and technology. This galaxy remains in constant struggle between the forces of good and evil. Step 2: Introduce the main characters Now, let's introduce the main characters. We have Princess Leia, a strong and determined leader who is fighting for justice and peace in the galaxy. We also have Jabba the Hutt, a ruthless and sly intergalactic criminal lord who seeks power and control over the entire galaxy. Step 3: Present the conflict The central conflict of the story revolves around Jabba the Hutt capturing Princess Leia after she is sent on an important mission by the rebel forces. Leia's mission is to deliver vital information to the rebels that could help them take down Jabba's criminal empire and strike a blow to the opposing evil forces in the galaxy. Step 4: Develop the storyline As the story unfolds, Princess Leia and her small team of rebel fighters embark on their daring mission. However, they are unknowingly betrayed by a double agent within their ranks. As they approach their destination, they are ambushed by Jabba's forces, who manage to capture Leia and bring her to Jabba's palace. Step 5: Introduce secondary characters and subplots During her captivity, Leia encounters other prisoners under Jabba's control. Among them, she discovers a mysterious and wise former Jedi who has been able to hide his powers from Jabba. This Jedi assists Leia in devising a plan to escape and continue her mission. Simultaneously, Leia's allies also learn about the betrayal. They set out to find and rescue Leia, all while discovering more secrets and lies operating within their ranks. Step 6: Build to a climax As the tensions build, the rebels and Jedi launch a daring rescue mission to liberate Leia from Jabba's palace. They successfully free Leia and the other prisoners while defeating many of Jabba's minions in the process. Step 7: Resolve the conflict In the final showdown, Princess Leia faces Jabba the Hutt one-on-one. With her newfound Jedi friend's guidance, Leia uses her wit, bravery, and strength to outsmart Jabba and secure her freedom. In the end, Jabba's criminal empire is left in ruins. Step 8: Conclude the story With Leia's escape and the exposure of the double agent, her mission's vital information is successfully delivered to the rebel forces. They use the knowledge to strike a significant blow to the dark forces in the galaxy, shifting the balance of power towards the good. As the movie concludes, Leia and her newly formed group of allies, including the enigmatic Jedi, continue their quest to bring peace and justice to the galaxy. The answer to the question \\"Who captures Princess Leia?\\" is Jabba the Hutt, kicking off a thrilling adventure filled with action, betrayal, and the quest for peace in a galaxy embroiled in conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A young Banjo Paterson, who later went on to write the iconic Australian bush ballad \\"Waltzing Matilda\\", was among the pitch invaders. Of the 10,000 spectators, up to 2,000 \\"participated in the disorder\\". Coulthard was jostled and Lord Harris, who had returned to the field to support Coulthard, was struck by a whip or stick but was not hurt. Hornby, a keen amateur boxer who had been offered the English captaincy before stepping aside for Harris, grabbed his captain's assailant and \\"conveyed his prisoner to the pavilion in triumph\\"; it was later said that he had caught the wrong man. Hornby was also attacked and almost lost the shirt off his back. Emmett and Ulyett each took a stump for protection and escorted Lord Harris off, assisted by some members. In the meantime, the crowd anger grew and there was mounting fear that the riot would intensify, due to speculation that the crowd would try to free Hornby's captive. However, there was only jostling as the players were evacuated into the pavilion, and the injuries were limited to minor cuts and bruises. An English naval captain who was at the ground had his top hat pulled over his eyes and was verbally abused by some spectators. After 30 minutes, the field was cleared.When the ground was finally cleared Gregory insisted, according to Harris, that Coulthard be replaced. When Harris would not agree, Gregory said, \\"Then the game is at an end\\". Harris asked Barton whether he could claim the match on a forfeit. Barton replied \\"I will give it to you in two minutes if the batsmen don't return\\". Harris then asked Barton to speak with Gregory to ascertain his intentions.

I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Rinaldo drew his sword to attack? from the following article ? The Crusader army under Goffredo is laying siege to Jerusalem, where the Saracen king Argante is confined with his troops. With Goffredo are his brother Eustazio, his daughter Almirena, and the knight Rinaldo. As Goffredo sings of the coming victory, Rinaldo declares his love for Almirena, and Goffredo confirms that she will be Rinaldo's bride when Jerusalem falls. Almirena urges Rinaldo to fight boldly and assure victory. As she departs, a herald announces the approach of Argante from the city. Eustazio surmises that the king fears defeat; this seems to be confirmed when Argante, after a grandiose entrance, requests a three-day truce to which Goffredo graciously assents. After Goffredo leaves, Argante ponders his love for Armida, the Queen of Damascus who is also a powerful sorceress, and considers the help her powers might bring him. As he muses, Armida arrives from the sky in a fiery chariot. She has divined that the Saracens' only chance of victory lies in vanquishing Rinaldo, and has the power, she claims, to achieve this. The scene changes to a garden, with fountains and birds, where Rinaldo and Almirena are celebrating their love. They are interrupted as Armida appears, and wrests Almirena from Rinaldo's embrace. Rinaldo draws his sword to defend his lover, but a black cloud descends to envelop Armida and Almirena, and they are borne away. Rinaldo mourns the loss of his loved one. When Goffredo and Eustazio arrive they comfort Rinaldo, and propose they visit a Christian magician who may have the power to save Almirena. Rinaldo, left alone, prays for strength.","completion":"In the article provided, the person that Rinaldo drew his sword to attack is the Queen of Damascus and powerful sorceress, Armida.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: waves break over a lighthouse as person hits","completion":"The most important words in the given sentence - \\"waves break over a lighthouse as person hits\\" - are as follows: 1) Waves: \\"Waves\\" indicate the energy generated by wind that travels across the surface of a body of water, such as an ocean or a lake, and creates the motion that generates the waves. Waves can be symbolic of the power or unpredictability of the natural world and are central to the visual imagery in the sentence as they are interacting directly with the lighthouse. 2) Break: \\"Break\\" refers to the action of waves collapsing or crashing, usually against a shoreline, a structure, or an object. Breaking waves are a natural phenomenon that can induce awe or fear due to their potential force and the dramatic visual image they produce. The breaking of the waves over the lighthouse emphasizes the magnitude and impact of the event described, creating a vivid scene. 3) Lighthouse: A \\"lighthouse\\" is typically a tall tower or a building near a coastline, equipped with a bright light and usually situated in a hazardous area or at a harbor entrance. The main purpose of a lighthouse is to guide sailors and warn ships about dangers in their path, such as reefs or rocky shores. In the context of this sentence, the lighthouse is the central object being affected by the waves and serves as a focus for the dramatic imagery. 4) Person: The \\"person\\" in this sentence adds a human element to the scene, as their actions or presence are noted in parallel with the waves crashing over the lighthouse. This can create a sense of tension, as a human presence in an environment that is dominated by natural forces can evoke feelings of vulnerability or defiance, depending on the specific context and interpretation. 5) Hits: \\"Hits\\" describes the action or moment where the person in the scene either physically strikes an object (or perhaps, metaphorically hits a difficult situation). This word is significant as it generates curiosity about the person's role in the story and their response to the dramatic natural scene involving the breaking waves and lighthouse. In summary, the most important words in the sentence are \\"waves,\\" \\"break,\\" \\"lighthouse,\\" \\"person,\\" and \\"hits\\" as they create a vivid, dynamic scene with a mix of natural elements and a human presence. These words set the tone and provide the key focal points that allow the reader or listener to visualize and understand the core elements of the scene being described."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Where do you buy rennet? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Cheese cannot be made without some form of coagulant, which causes the proteins in milk to separate into curds and whey. While cheese is traditionally made with rennet, a set of enzymes typically derived from the stomach of ruminant animals such as cows, sheep, or goats, there are ways to make cheese without animal-derived rennet. There are two main alternatives to animal rennet: vegetarian rennet and acid coagulation. 1. Vegetarian rennet: Vegetarian-friendly substitutes are made from various sources, such as plants, fungi, or microorganisms. Plant-based rennet alternatives come from plants like thistle, artichoke, or fig leaves, though they can affect the flavor and texture of the final cheese. Also, microbial or fungal rennet is produced from specific molds or bacteria, which produces enzymes similar to those found in animal rennet. This fungal or microbial rennet is often used in commercial cheese production. 2. Acid coagulation: Another method to make cheese without using rennet involves inducing coagulation by adding an acid to milk. In this case, substances like vinegar, lemon juice, or citric acid are used to acidify the milk and separate the curds and whey. Such cheeses include paneer, queso blanco, and ricotta. In summary, while animal-derived rennet is the most common coagulant for cheese-making, there are alternatives for those seeking vegetarian or rennet-free options. To buy rennet, you can look for it in the following places: 1. Local specialty food stores: Some stores may carry rennet in their cheese-making or specialty ingredient sections. This is more likely in places that offer a wider variety of food products. 2. Cheese-making supply shops: If there's a store dedicated to cheese-making in your area, they will likely carry rennet as well as other cheese-making supplies and ingredients. 3. Online retailers: There are numerous online retailers (such as Amazon, eBay, and others) selling rennet, both animal-derived and non-animal-based alternatives. You can also find specialized websites selling cheese-making supplies and ingredients that offer various rennet options. 4. Farmers' markets: Sometimes, local cheesemakers or farmers selling milk and dairy products at farmers' markets may also carry rennet or be able to direct you to a source for it. As for the question of whether these two questions are paraphrases, they are not paraphrases of each other, as they convey different meanings and information. The first question asks if it is possible to make cheese without rennet, while the second question asks where rennet can be purchased."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to conclusively determine that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. In order to reach a logical conclusion, we need to examine both the premise and hypothesis, and explore the relationship between them. The premise mentions that the show \\"challenged Twin Peaks in obscure plot turns,\\" which suggests that the show had puzzling and mysterious plot twists that might be difficult for the audience to understand or predict. Furthermore, the premise states that the show was \\"ever entertaining,\\" indicating that it successfully maintained the audience's interest throughout its run. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that the show had \\"predictable plot turns.\\" This implies that the show's plot twists were easily anticipated by the viewers, which contradicts the premise's assertion of the show's obscure plot turns that challenged Twin Peaks. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and hypothesis: If the premise is true (i.e., the show had obscure and challenging plot turns, and was ever entertaining), then the hypothesis (i.e., the show had predictable plot turns) cannot also be true, as it contradicts the information in the premise. The show's plot twists cannot be both predictable and obscure/challenging at the same time, as these traits are mutually exclusive. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. In fact, based on the information provided, it would be more reasonable to argue that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is false, since the two statements describe conflicting attributes of the show's plot turns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement is referring to Oscar Niemeyer and Roberto Burle Marx, prominent figures in the construction of public buildings and landscape designing aspects, but they were not the individuals responsible for ordering the construction of Brasilia. The correct answer to the question is that President Juscelino Kubitschek, the 21st President of Brazil, ordered the construction of Brasilia. He served as president from 1956 to 1961, and during his tenure, he initiated the project of building a new capital for the country. Named Brasilia, this city was envisioned to act as a symbol of a new era for Brazil, aimed at promoting economic growth and development across the nation. The decision to build a new capital in the nation's interior was also an attempt to reduce regional disparities and concentrate less population and political power in the coastal cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. By encouraging the development of central Brazil, the government sought to distribute resources and investments more evenly across the country. Oscar Niemeyer, an influential Brazilian architect, and his close friend, the landscape designer Roberto Burle Marx, were commissioned to design and plan the new capital. Niemeyer was responsible for the architecture of most public buildings in the city, creating a remarkable style that combined modernist principles with organic and flowing shapes. Marx was the mastermind behind the landscaping of the city, working closely with Niemeyer to bring his exceptional vision for the city's green spaces to life. In conclusion, the statement provided does not answer the question about who ordered Brasilia to be built. President Juscelino Kubitschek was the one responsible for the decision, while Oscar Niemeyer and Roberto Burle Marx played crucial roles in shaping the architectural and landscape identity of the city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"No, the statement \\"He orchestrated the realignment of voters that created the Fifth Party System\\" does not directly answer the question of when Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) was elected as President. However, it does provide a related fact about his significant impact on American politics. To provide a detailed and long answer to the question, FDR was elected as the 32nd President of the United States for the first time on November 8, 1932. He went on to win three more consecutive elections and served from March 4, 1933, until his death on April 12, 1945. He is the only U.S. President to have served more than two terms. Regarding the realignment of voters, FDR's presidential tenure profoundly influenced the American political landscape. He led the Democratic Party's progressive coalition - a coalition that united various groups, including labor unions, diverse ethnic and religious groups, farmers, and African Americans. These groups previously had not been aligned under one party, but came together under FDR's transformative New Deal policies, which were aimed at combating the Great Depression through economic and social reforms, as well as relief and recovery measures. This realignment gave birth to the Fifth Party System in U.S. politics, which lasted from the 1930s to the 1960s. The Fifth Party System saw a significant increase in voter support for the Democratic Party, with the party becoming the dominant political force during this period. FDR's leadership and his policies advocating for labor rights, social welfare, and infrastructural development significantly contributed to redefining the Democratic Party's image and turning it into the party that represented the interests of working-class Americans and minorities. In conclusion, while the statement about FDR orchestrating the realignment of voters creating the Fifth Party System is an interesting and relevant fact, it does not serve as a direct answer to the question of when he was elected as President. Franklin D. Roosevelt was first elected as the President of the United States on November 8, 1932, and his transformative policies helped create a new political landscape in America."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve this equation for i, you should first gather all the i terms on one side of the equation. Follow these steps: Step 1: Original equation 9 * i = -3 * i - 24 Step 2: Add 3 * i to both sides of the equation (9 * i) + (3 * i) = (-3 * i) + (3 * i) - 24 Simplify the equation: Step 3: Combine like terms 12 * i = -24 Now, to isolate i, you should divide both sides of the equation by 12: Step 4: Divide by 12 (12 * i) / 12 = -24 / 12 Step 5: Simplify the equation i = -2 So, the solution for the equation 9 * i = -3 * i - 24 is i = -2. This means that when i equals -2, the equation is true and both sides are equal."},{"prompt":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who had three operas survive with their music and librettos intact? The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida... Answer:","completion":"Monteverdi"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: ADHD is a medical condition, not a sign of mental weakness or a personal problem. For this reason, in cases where the symptoms of ADHD are serious enough that the DIY suggestions in the sections above don't work, seeing a doctor should be your next step. Only a trained medical professional can definitively diagnose a case of ADHD and decide which treatment options are best. The three types of ADHD are explained below: ADHD, Primarily Inattentive Type. This type of ADHD is characterized by: difficulty sustaining attention; being easily distracted; appears forgetful; appears not to be listening; and demonstrates problems with organization. ADHD, Primarily Hyperactive/Impulsive Type. In this type, children and adults exhibit: trouble sitting still; trouble awaiting turns in groups; talking/humming/making noises; moving around and climbing excessively; fidgeting; and blurting out answers. ADHD, Combined Type. Combined type includes those individuals who meet the criteria for both Inattentive and Hyperactive/Impulsive types. The most widely-known medications used to treat ADHD belong to a class of drugs called stimulants. As their name suggests, these medications stimulate the central nervous system, increasing the user's heart rate and mental activity. Paradoxically, most people with ADHD who take these medications report that they have a calming, focusing effect, rather than leaving them jittery and unable to concentrate. Stimulants have been found to improve ADHD symptoms about 70% of the time. However, everyone reacts to medication a little differently, so it's wise to be willing to experiment with different medicines until you find one that's right for you. Common stimulants used to treat ADHD include Ritalin, Focalin, Adderall, and Concerta. The most common side effects of these stimulants include reduced appetite, difficulty sleeping, and sometimes headaches, stomachaches, and increased blood pressure. However, most side effects can be reduced or eliminated by changing the dosage. For some people, stimulants just don't work very well for treating ADHD. Rarely, stimulants' side effects may be so unpleasant that taking them isn't worth it. Luckily, in these cases, there are some non-stimulant drugs available for treating ADHD. These drugs generally work by increasing the amount of a chemical called norepinephrine in the brain, which makes it easier for most people to focus. As noted above, these drugs affect everyone differently, so be willing to work with your doctor to experiment with different drugs and dosages until you find a treatment that's right for you. Common non-stimulants used to treat ADHD include Strattera, Intuniv, and Kapvay. Intuniv and Kapvay are approved only for children. Side effects for non-stimulants vary from drug to drug. Common side effects include stomachache, decreased appetite, fatigue, mood swings, headache, and irritability. In rare cases, serious problems like liver disease, depression, stunted growth in children, and sexual problems are possible. Clinical treatment for ADHD isn't all about medicine. In fact, many people who struggle with ADHD find that it's both satisfying and productive to talk to an experienced counselor or therapist about their frustrations, difficulties, and successes dealing with their condition. Speaking with someone who's trained to give helpful advice about life's difficulties can offer psychological relief from the stresses caused by ADHD and can even help you adopt responsible, focus-improving behavior patterns. Don't be ashamed or embarrassed to contact a therapist. A 2008 study found that 13 percent of American adults had received some sort of mental health treatment. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of something that may be longer or more complicated. In this case, ADHD is a medical condition with three types - Primarily Inattentive, Primarily Hyperactive/Impulsive, and Combined Type. Doctors can help diagnose ADHD and suggest the best treatment, which can include medications like stimulants or non-stimulants, or talking to a counselor or therapist. It's important to remember that everyone is different and may need different treatments to help them with their ADHD."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person Richardson called the most beautiful character in modern history? , can you please find it? On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson walked into the National Gallery and attacked Velázquez's canvas with a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.Richardson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork. In a statement to the Women's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, \\"I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.\\" She added in a 1952 interview that she didn't like \\"the way men visitors gaped at it all day long\\".The feminist writer Lynda Nead observed, \\"The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude; in a sense, it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally.\\" Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork. Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder (Richardson was nicknamed \\"Slasher Mary\\"), and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body, rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body. The Times described a \\"cruel wound in the neck\\", as well as incisions to the shoulders and back.

Answer the following question: Information: - Turkmenidae is an extinct family of lamprids from the Paleogene of Turkmenistan. They were small, disk-shaped fish that bore a strong resemblance to their closest living relatives, the opahs. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The Oligocene is a geologic epoch of the Paleogene Period and extends from about 33.9 million to 23 million years before the present (to ). As with other older geologic periods, the rock beds that define the epoch are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain. The name Oligocene comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"oligos\\", few) and (\\"kainos\\", new), and refers to the sparsity of extant forms of molluscs. The Oligocene is preceded by the Eocene Epoch and is followed by the Miocene Epoch. The Oligocene is the third and final epoch of the Paleogene Period. The Oligocene is often considered an important time of transition, a link between the archaic world of the tropical Eocene and the more modern ecosystems of the Miocene. Major changes during the Oligocene included a global expansion of grasslands, and a regression of tropical broad leaf forests to the equatorial belt. - Analectis pala is an extinct lamprid of the Family Turkmenidae . Its fossils are found from Late Oligocene strata from what is now Turkmenistan . Analectis , as with the other members of Turkmenidae , was a close relative of the opahs . - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - Turkmenistan (or ); formerly known as Turkmenia is a country in Central Asia, bordered by Kazakhstan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north and east, Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the south and southwest, and the Caspian Sea to the west. - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain. - Opahs (also commonly known as moonfish, sunfish (not to be confused with Molidae), kingfish, redfin ocean pan, and Jerusalem haddock) are large, colorful, deep-bodied pelagic lampriform fishes comprising the small family Lampridae (also spelled Lamprididae). Only two living species occur in a single genus: \\"Lampris\\" (from the Greek \\"lamprid-\\", \\"brilliant\\" or \\"clear\\"). One species is found in tropical to temperate waters of most oceans, while the other is limited to a circumglobal distribution in the Southern Ocean, with the 34°S as its northern limit. Two additional species, one in the genus \\"Lampris\\" and the other in the monotypic \\"Megalampris\\", are only known from fossil remains. The extinct family, Turkmenidae, from the Paleogene of Central Asia, is closely related, though much smaller. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.

D'Angelo was born Michael Eugene Archer, in Richmond, Virginia on February 11, 1974, to a Pentecostal preacher father. He was raised in an entirely Pentecostal family. Archer's musical talents were discovered very early on. At 3, he was spotted by his 10-year-old brother Luther, playing the house piano. D'Angelo signed a publishing deal with EMI Music in 1991 after catching the attention of record executives through a demo tape, which was originally by the group. After an impressive audition for EMI execs, a three-hour impromptu piano recital, D'Angelo was signed to a recording contract in 1993. A&R-man Gary Harris was primarily responsible for his signing, while manager Kedar Massenburg helped negotiate the contract as well. Massenburg became D'Angelo's manager after hearing of him through \\"the buzz on the streets\\". He had previously managed hip hop group Stetsasonic and formed the artist management-firm Kedar Entertainment in 1991, which he diversified into production, music publishing and publicity. In 1994, his first significant success came in the form of the hit single \\"U Will Know\\". D'Angelo co-wrote and co-produced the song for the all-male R&B supergroup Black Men United, which featured R&B singers such as Brian McKnight, Usher, R. Kelly, Boyz II Men, Raphael Saadiq and Gerald Levert. D'Angelo composed the music for \\"U Will Know\\", while his brother, Luther Archer, wrote the lyrics. Originally featured on the soundtrack to the film Jason's Lyric (1994), the single peaked at number 5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video for \\"U Will Know\\" featured D'Angelo as the group's choir director; he reprised the role for the live performance of the song at the Soul Train Music Awards. That same year, he wrote and produced the song \\"Overjoyed\\" for the Boys Choir of Harlem, which appeared on their studio album The Sound of Hope (1994). The success of \\"U Will Know\\" helped build the buzz surrounding D'Angelo, which was followed by a number of highly promoted showcases, and added to the buzz among music industry insiders. Brown Sugar was released in June 1995. Although sales were sluggish at first, the album was eventually a hit. The album debuted at number six on the US Billboard Top R&B Albums chart in the week of July 22, 1995. It ultimately peaked at number four in the week of February 24, 1996, and spent a total of 54 weeks on the chart. Brown Sugar also spent 65 weeks on the Billboard 200 and peaked at number 22 on the chart. It sold 300,000 copies within its two months of release. The album had been selling 35,000 to 40,000 copies a week through to November 1995, and by January 1996, it had sold 400,000 copies. With the help of its four singles, including the gold-selling Billboard Hot 100 hit \\"Lady\\" and R&B top-ten singles \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Cruisin\\", the album reached sales of 500,000 copies in the United States by October 1995. On February 7, 1996, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, following shipments in excess of one million copies in the U.S. The album was certified gold in Canada on May 9, 2000. Its total sales have been estimated within the range of 1.5 million to over two million copies.","completion":"This text is about D'Angelo, who was born as Michael Eugene Archer. He's a talented man who creates music. He was born in Richmond in the state of Virginia on February 11, 1974. His father was a preacher, a person who talks about religious subjects in church, and he grew up in a very religious family. When he was very young, just 3 years old, his older brother noticed that he could play the piano really well. Later, when he was a young man, D'Angelo got a job with a big music company called EMI Music because they thought he was very talented. He got to make his own music and his first big song was called \\"U Will Know\\". He wasn't alone, though. He made the song with lots of other people who also make music, like Brian McKnight, Usher, and R. Kelly. A lot of people heard his song because it was in a movie and on the radio too. D'Angelo made more songs and an album called \\"Brown Sugar\\". At first, not many people bought it but after a while, more and more people started to like it and buy it. It sold so many copies that it won an award for selling over a million copies!

Even after Bin Laden's departure from the area, CIA officers hoped he might return, seeing the camp as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up. The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance. Imagery confirmed that less than a week after Clarke's phone call the camp was hurriedly dismantled, and the site was deserted. CIA officers, including Deputy Director for Operations Pavitt, were irate.\\" Mike\\" thought the dismantling of the camp erased a possible site for targeting Bin Laden. The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem. From 1999 through early 2001, the United States, and President Clinton personally, pressed the UAE, one of the Taliban's only travel and financial outlets to the outside world, to break off its ties and enforce sanctions, especially those relating to flights to and from Afghanistan. These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over Bin Laden. The Taliban did not take him seriously, however. Bin Zayid later told an American diplomat that the UAE valued its relations with the Taliban because the Afghan radicals offered a counterbalance to \\"Iranian dangers\\" in the region, but he also noted that the UAE did not want to upset the United States.

UPDATED:. 04:22 EST, 28 September 2012. Two newborn babies have died after contracting a rare killer bug which swept through a neonatal unit. The unit has now been closed and deep cleaned after staff discovered deadly bacteria at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS) which left five other babies fighting for their lives. The worrying outbreak infected seven children in total - four have now been allowed to return home while another remains in intensive care. The A&E department at University Hospital of North Staffordshire. After the bug was detected in July the hospital continued to admit babies born in the centre, although it closed to admissions from other hospitals. Now a review of practices at the hospital by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) is underway. Post-mortem examinations on the babies, both born before 28 weeks, found they died from the Serratia Marcescens bacteria. Further tests on the surviving newborns showed the infection had been picked up while on the ward. The surviving infants were found to be carriers of the bug and did not suffer the illness itself. But they were placed in isolation incubators while their treatment continued for conditions linked to be being born prematurely. Serratia Marcescens is a rod-shaped pathogen involved in hospital infections. Last night, chief executive Julie Bridgewater said: 'We identified the infection in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit(NICU). It can affect babies born extremely premature. 'Sadly two babies who died, both born before 28 weeks, had this uncommon infection and postmortems confirmed Serratia Marcescens as the cause of death. 'The families of the two babies were informed at the time of this infection.' UHNS infection experts said the parents of babies already discharged had no need to worry. Consultant Microbiologist Dr Jeorge Orendi said: 'As a precaution we temporarily closed NICU to new admissions. 'The five other babies who were carrying the organism, but not unwell, were isolated. 'One of those continues to be treated on the unit for other conditions and will remain here until well enough to go home. 'In addition we carried out a deep clean of neonatal intensive care and reviewed infection prevention practice immediately with assistance from the HPA. Vulnerable: Neonatal units specialise in the care of ill or premature babies (file picture) 'Further tests on the organisms isolated performed by the HPA confirmed an outbreak. 'The unit introduced enhanced contact isolation and weekly screening.There have been no new cases of infection of babies carrying the organism since the initial cases were first identified in July. 'All the families with babies on the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the time that the infection was identified were kept fully informed.' Serratia Marcescens is found in the stomach and bowel of children and can cause serious illness in premature babies. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Sign up for our newsletter and other special offers: sign me up Thank you for signing up! Relatives of a family of five found dead last month in the upstairs bedroom of their Springville, Utah, home, tell PEOPLE exclusively that they believe Benjamin and Kristi Strack took their own lives and the lives of their three children because the couple suffered from long-term mental illness and substance-abuse disorders.The Stracks were found dead by an older son, Janson McGee, with cups of red liquid next to their bodies, on Sept. 27. The children – Benson, 14, Emery, 12, and Zion, 11 – were found lying on and around the bed, covered with blankets up to their necks, with empty bottles of liquid methadone and boxes of cold and flu medication nearby.Investigators have determined the cause of death to be accidental or intentional poisoning (autopsy results won't be released until the end of November), but Benjamin Strack's brother says the deaths were no accident.Isaac Strack, 39, says family members cleaning out the Stracks' home a few days after the grim discovery found a notebook with a letter inside, written by Benson Strack to one of his best friends. \\"It was pretty clear that it was a goodbye letter,\\" says Strack. \\"It indicated that Benson was aware that something was going to happen. Benson at least had some idea that he might be found dead someday.\\"He and other distraught family members say that looking back, they now realize that Benjamin, 37, and Kristi, 36, were showing signs of mental illness, especially in the weeks before their deaths. \\"They had isolated themselves from neighbors and some of the family,\\" he says, \\"and it had been awhile since Ben had been to work.\\"Isaac and another relative, Bob McGee, Janson's uncle, say that Benjamin and Kristi Strack were also exhibiting \\"irrational fear,\\" afraid that something or someone was going to harm them.\\"Their mental illness combined with substance-abuse disorder is what led to this tragedy,\\" says Isaac. \\"Some of the changed behaviors before their deaths seemed out of place and didn't make sense at the time. But looking back now, they make sense. And now we want to speak out to prevent other people from having to endure what we are enduring.\\"Extended family members believe that the couple were \\"victims of their minds,\\" says McGee, with their mental illness caused and made worse by drug use. \\"This one action does not define the Ben and Kristi that we remember,\\" he says. \\"They were caught in a vicious cycle that many people face in this world. There needs to be a greater sense of dialogue and urgency in our country regarding mental illness. It is simply a disease of the mind, and like any disease, we should work to cure it and prevent it.\\"Lt. David Caron of the Springville Police Department told PEOPLE that while he appreciates the family members' concerns for people suffering from mental illness, it would be inappropriate to make any comment concerning the case.\\"Our contacts with the family were fairly limited in scope,\\" he said. \\"Therefore I would defer to the family members who both knew and loved Ben and Kristi, and who are grappling with the sorrow caused by this tragic event.\\" ||||| SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Relatives of five Utah family members found dead in a locked bedroom last month suspected the deaths weren't accidental, and revelations that poison likely killed them confirmed their suspicions, according to a statement released Thursday.

(Associated Press) A vigil is held for the Strack family at Pioneer Park in Provo after the family of five who were mysteriously found dead in their Springville home last Saturday. A Springville Police news release identified... (Associated Press) Jacob Strack said his family is struggling after learning from search warrants Wednesday that police found cups with a red liquid inside next to each of the bodies, some of which appeared to have been positioned after death. Empty packages of methadone and cold medicine were in the family's trash. Benjamin and Kristi Strack were found Sept. 27 in a bed with three of their children, ages 11 to 14, lying around them tucked into bedding up to their necks. Kristi Strack had a red liquid coming out of her mouth. The family was shocked and upset by the information, but it unfortunately confirmed their fears, according to a statement from Jacob Strack, who is Benjamin Strack's brother and is acting as a family spokesman. He declined to elaborate, saying the relatives are working with the National Alliance on Mental Illness to release more information later. The bodies were found by the couple's older son and Kristi Strack's mother, who said she couldn't believe \\"she\\" would do this to the kids but wouldn't elaborate, according to the search warrants. Court records show the couple had a history of legal and financial problems, and had gone through court-ordered drug treatment several years ago. The methadone found in the home had been dispensed by a drug treatment clinic, the search warrants said. Methadone is a prescription drug used for decades to treat drug addiction, but is increasing prescribed for pain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the Stracks' troubles appeared to be behind them, said Alex Short, owner at AK Masonry, a bricklaying company where Benjamin Strack worked. \\"When he came over, he was kind of at the tail end of all those problems,\\" said Short, who employed Benjamin Strack for about seven years on-and-off. He was at times a solid employee, but would occasionally stop showing up for work for periods of time, explaining his absences by saying he was doing things for his wife, Short said Thursday. He hadn't been at work for more than a week when he died. Police in Springville are awaiting toxicology results next month that could pinpoint an exact cause of death, and speculating before then would be unprofessional, said Lt. David Caron in a statement Thursday. Investigators found empty methadone bottles, 10 empty boxes of nighttime cold medicine and two boxes of allergy medicine in the family's garbage, along with a red liquid substance in Pepsi cups. They also found a pitcher of red juice, a purple bucket with yellow liquid, a bag of marijuana and other medications, including sleeping pills. Methadone can be lethal when taken in excess. Thousands of people die each year from methadone overdoses, according to the CDC. The couple also has an older son, whose girlfriend also lived with the family. She was the last to see Kristi Strack alive at 6 a.m. The girlfriend went back to sleep after talking with her, and the house was quiet when the couple left that afternoon. When the older son and his girlfriend returned at 7 p.m. and found it still quiet even though all the cars were in the driveway, they knocked on the master bedroom door. After no one answered, the couple called Kristi Strack's mother and her friend, who helped them force it open. The five were identified as Benjamin Strack, 37, his wife, Kristi, 36, and three of their children: Benson, 14, Emery, 12, and Zion, 11. Springville is a city of about 30,000 near Provo, about 45 miles south of Salt Lake City. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Relatives of Benjamin and Kristi Strack, a couple found dead along with their three children in their Springville, Utah home, believe that the parents poisoned themselves and their children due to long-term mental illness and substance-abuse disorders.

We have this equation: -192 * a + 185 * a = -7 Now, we need to find how many 'a's (let's call them apples) we have in total. So, we add the apples from the first part (-192 apples) to the second part (185 apples). -192 apples + 185 apples = -7 apples Hmm, if we add the second part to the first part, we get: -192 + 185 = -7 (total apples) Now, if we simplify that, we get: -7 apples (total apples) So our equation now looks like this: -7 apples = -7 To find the value of 'a' (one apple), we just need to divide the total number of apples (-7) by the total apples (-7) in our equation: -7 apples / -7 = a When we divide a negative number by itself, we get 1.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: How does the bacteria get acquired resistance? Context: Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Potential Unfulfilled, Disappointing Experience - 2 Stars I recently downloaded the app with the package com.google.android.stardroid from the app store, hoping for an exceptional astronomy experience. Unfortunately, my experience has been quite underwhelming, meriting a 2-star rating, and here's why: Firstly, the user interface left a lot to be desired. Navigating the app was rather cumbersome, with unclear labels and buttons. The layout felt cluttered, which made it challenging to enjoy the stargazing experience it promised. I found myself struggling to understand the settings and customize the app to my liking. Secondly, the app's performance was subpar. It took a considerable amount of time to load, and I encountered lagging and freezing issues multiple times while using it. This disrupted the smooth and immersive experience I expected from a stargazing app. Additionally, the accuracy of celestial object positioning seemed to be off at times. As an amateur astronomer, I was hoping to use this app to confidently identify and learn more about stars, planets, and constellations. However, I couldn't fully trust the app as it occasionally misplaced objects or failed to showcase certain noticeable stars and planets. Lastly, the lack of customer support or any clear resources for help was disappointing. I tried searching for instructions or tutorials both within the app and online, but my efforts proved fruitless. It would have been helpful to have access to a knowledge base or a responsive customer service team to address the issues I encountered. In conclusion, the app with the package com.google.android.stardroid leaves a lot to be desired. Despite its promising concept, the overall experience was marred by a poor user interface, performance issues, questionable accuracy, and an absence of customer support. I hope the developers take this feedback into account and make the necessary improvements to elevate this app to its full potential. Until those changes are made, I'd be hesitant to recommend this app to fellow stargazers."},{"prompt":"\\"This is really a very fast game, the fastest I've seen so far this year.

Instead, it is a figurative expression that refers to the administrative center in a particular county. A county seat is typically the location where the county's local government offices and services are housed. The offices that could be found in a county seat may include the headquarters of the county board, courthouses, and other administrative offices responsible for public utilities, records, and registers, among others.

UPDATED:. 05:57 EST, 29 December 2013. Immigration officials at one airport stopped more than 300 such health tourists over two years. Hundreds of pregnant foreigners are flying to Britain just days before they give birth so that they can receive free healthcare courtesy of the NHS, a report has found. The women are duping airlines - who normally forbid expectant mothers more than 36 weeks pregnant to fly - so they can receive the free service. Expectant mothers trick airlines in their home countries into letting them fly by showing staff forged doctors notes which conceal the length of their pregnancies. Most of the women who arrive at NHS hospitals then have to be admitted and allowed to give birth, the report found, because their pregnancies were too advanced for them to fly home. The average cost of a birth with no complications and one night's stay in an NHS hospital is £1,092. Immigration officials at one airport stopped more than 300 such health tourists over two years, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The revelations follow a worrying report in October, that warned that foreign visitors and short-term migrants cost the NHS £2billion a year. It concluded the Health Service has ‘some of the most generous rules in the world’. And it even found evidence of relatives of migrants taking advantage of visits to Britain to have free treatment. The bill was put at between £1.9billion and £2billion – with only around 16 per cent of the money clawed back. The. Government said it would be ‘impractical or inappropriate’ to charge in. full some patients, such as students or those with infectious diseases. The study estimated that £388million goes on foreign patients who should pay for their care but are never charged. The statistics emerged from an old document on government plans to deny foreigners with unpaid NHS bills entry to the UK. Though the majority of NHS treatments will incur a cost for foreign visitors or short-term migrants, there are a handful of circumstances whereby they receive care for free. According to the NHS website, these include:. Though, officially, pregnancy or maternity treatments are not free of charge, patients who arrive in A&E who are ready to give birth must be treated. Health tourists – those who specifically travel to the UK for treatment – cost up to £300million more. The. addition of foreigners to hospitals whose resources already struggle to. cope with an increasing number British patients is bad news to. over-stretched staff. A spokesman for the Royal College of. Nursing and Midwifery said: 'There is no doubt about the pressures on. midwives and maternity services due to the increasing birthrate, the. increasing complexity of births and the shortage of midwives in England. Though the College. insists midwives are there to treat any pregnant woman who presents. themselves in need of care, there are concerns surrounding the added. strain on staff. 'The RCM wants to ensure that England's maternity services have the right number of staff and right resources to offer all women the safest and highest quality care.' The statistics emerged from a 2010 document on government plans to deny foreigners with unpaid NHS bills entry to the UK. The. first comprehensive assessment of ‘health tourism’ says the true cost. to taxpayers is up to 100 times bigger than some estimates. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Answer this question: what type of poem is disabled by wilfred owen??","completion":"\\"Disabled\\" is a war poem written by the British poet Wilfred Owen during World War I. The poem is a dramatic monologue, a type of lyric poem in which the speaker directly addresses the reader or a silent listener. This particular verse form allows the poet to reveal the inner thoughts and emotions of the principal character, providing the audience with a greater understanding of the theme and subject matter. The poem's content and style make it a part of the war poetry genre, which captures the experiences, emotions, and traumas endured by soldiers and civilians during wartime. Owen's work focuses on the personal side of war, specifically the lasting impact of physical and emotional trauma on the human psyche. \\"Disabled\\" tells the story of a young soldier who has returned from war with life-changing injuries, emphasizing the harsh reality faced by many servicemen who lived through the horrors of the battlefield. The poem is characterized by its vivid imagery, stark realism, and somber tone. Its structure is quite informal, comprising of six stanzas of uneven length and irregular rhyme. Owen employs the use of enjambment, a poetic technique that allows a sentence or phrase to extend beyond one line or stanza, which creates a flow of ideas and thoughts. This technique is effective in capturing the internal monologue of the speaker and further emphasizes the emotions and memories that overwhelm the soldier. In \\"Disabled,\\" the language and style are consistent with the other poems by Wilfred Owen, who is known for his ability to depict the horrors of war with striking realism and emotional depth. The poem incorporates themes of physical and emotional loss, isolation, nostalgia, and the disillusionment with war propagated by romantic and nationalistic ideals. It also contrasts the soldier's past life before the war, when he was a young and healthy man enjoying his youth, with his current life of suffering and hopelessness. This contrast resonates with the audience and serves as a message against the glorification of war. In summary, \\"Disabled\\" is a dramatic monologue that belongs to the war poetry genre. Its emotive language, informal structure, and thought-provoking themes make it an evocative and powerful commentary on the physical and mental consequences of war for the soldiers who fight in it. The poem reflects Wilfred Owen's experiences during World War I, providing a poignant account of the losses endured by those caught up in the conflict."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, when we take away 91 from both sides, we have: 2*l = 99 - 91 Step 2: Calculate 99 - 91. Now we just need to subtract 91 from 99, which is: 2*l = 8 Step 3: Divide both sides by 2. To find the value of 'l', we need to get rid of the 2 that is being multiplied by 'l'. We do this by dividing both sides by 2. So, we have: l = 8 ÷ 2 Step 4: Calculate 8 ÷ 2. Finally, we just need to divide 8 by 2, which is: l = 4 And that's the solution! So, the value of 'l' in the equation 2*l + 91 = 99 is: l = 4"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Toys are needed to keep these sick children happy and quiet. Money for them can be sent to the hospital.

The children in the hospital felt very happy to see the toys. The children in the class felt happy, too. A few days later, Mrs. Weeks read another newspaper story to the class: Some school pupils brought toys to Children's Hospital last week.

The sign, near the Ford Road exit, is almost entirely in Arabic — with the exception of “Donald Trump” typed in English and the web address: trumpisscared.org. Melissa Harris, spokeswoman for the super PAC “Nuisance Committee” which posted the billboard told WWJ Newsradio 950 the Arabic message translates to: “Donald Trump doesn’t know what this means, but he’s scared of it anyway.” She said her group chose Dearborn because of its large Arab-American population. “We intentionally did not put the translation on the board,” Harris explained, in an interview with WWJ’s Zahra Huber, “because I like the idea of people who do not speak Arabic have to ask their friends who do speak Arabic for them to translate the board for them.” “And I personally hope this also will generate some dialogue between Arabic speaking people and non-Arabic speaking people in Detroit and across the country.” The Nuisance Committee is a political action committee founded by the creators of the popular party game Cards Against Humanity with the mission, Harris said, “to annoy Donald Trump.” Harris said her group hopes to motivate the Arab-American community to have their voices heard — especially in Michigan, which is a swing state. “The primary purpose is to turn out the vote; and I think the secondary purpose is to have a conversation about Donald Trump’s positions on immigration,” Harris said. “We’re not name-calling, we’re not insulting…We’re simply pointing out that his fear, Donald Trump’s fear of Muslims and of immigrants is wholly irrational,” she added. “It is not based in fact; and we hope this exposes, you know, what we feel is the true motivation behind his hateful rhetoric, which is fear — irrational fear.” Trump caused a stir among some Arab-Americans back in September when he called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until, he said, our country’s representatives “can figure out what is going on.” In last week’s town hall-style presidential debate, Trump was asked by a Muslim audience member: “How will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?” “You’re right about Islamophobia and that’s a shame,” he replied, adding: “Muslims have to report the problems when they see them. And you know there’s always a reason for everything. If they don’t do that, it’s a very difficult situation for our country.” Photos of the billboard are making the rounds on social media; one having been retweeted more than 5,000 times as of Monday. Member of the American Middle East Coalition for Trump and former Farmington Hills city councilman John Akouri issued a response to the idea that Arabic people don’t like the Republican nominee. “Contrary to the false mainstream media narrative, many members of the Middle Eastern Community — such as myself — fully support Donald Trump for President because we know he is the only candidate who can bring the necessary change needed to unleash our economy and make the world a safer and more peaceful place,” Akouri said in a statement. “Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s poor judgment in the Middle East has already cost us too much – we simply cannot afford what would be nothing more than a third Obama term.” ||||| Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images If you don’t play the Blizzard Entertainment team-shooter multiplayer game Overwatch, this Florida billboard is probably baffling. But if you do, this is a clever and incisive critique of Donald Trump’s temperament. (Maybe you don’t need another one, but it’s still nice to have.) APPARENTLY IN MY AREA THERES A BILLBOARD THAT SAYS \\"DONALD TRUMP MAINS HANZO AND COMPLAINS ABOUT TEAM COMP IN ALL CHAT\\" I NEED TO SEE IT pic.twitter.com/Au70OthAAW — 🔮👻💀skeli💀👻🔮 (@GHOSTFXCKER) October 14, 2016 Here’s the billboard, which sits on the corner of North Alafaya Drive and Colonial Drive (Florida State Route 50) in the University of Central Florida’s campus, again from a better angle:* Advertisement Let me explain. It refers to Hanzo Shimada, a character in Overwatch who is a Japanese archer-slash-assassin with ties to a criminal dynasty. He’s a super #edgy loner with this tortured backstory that peaks when he causes the apparent death of his own brother. It’s a really sad story, I promise. There’s even a great animated short about it. Overwatch requires players to pick a character and then carry out an objective with their team to win. Some of the options are great all-purpose characters, useful in many situations. But Hanzo, who fires arrows, is hard to use and not always relevant. Players who “main” Hanzo use him as often as possible, even if the situation doesn’t necessarily call for a Japanese assassin who fires arrows. When (not if) things go wrong, and if that player is a jerk, he will blame the whole team, even though he picked the wrong person to begin with. Melissa Harris, spokeswoman for the Nuisance Committee, said the billboard was installed between Thursday and Friday and will stay up until Election Day. Advertisement “We're trying to remind college students, young people, gamers that they need to stand up and be counted,” Harris wrote via email. “And this is the it game right now.”* The ad also directs people to TrumpIsNotATeamPlayer.com, which calls out the various ways Donald Trump is unfit to be president—while also superimposing his face on other characters from Overwatch. “Donald Trump has no regard for the American democratic process,” the website reads, “and has said that if he loses the election, it’s because the system is rigged against him.” Harris identified the Chicago-based Daniel Warren Johnson as the campaign’s illustrator and Lindsey Camelio as its designer.* Advertisement Even if you don’t play Overwatch, or any video games, you’re familiar with That Person. You know, the one who doesn’t usually have anything useful to contribute, picks fights, and is generally the most inflexible and infuriating individual around. Donald Trump is That Person, and he is running for president. It’s kind of like this video by Rundle67: This billboard was paid for by the super PAC Nuisance Committee, which is also behind an anti-Trump billboard in Illinois that directed people to TrumpDoesntPayTaxes.com. And who is behind the Nuisance Committee? Why, it’s the creators of Cards Against Humanity. The company launched campaign-themed card packs earlier this year with the promise to split the promotion’s proceeds between “direct, legal contributions to Hillary Clinton’s PAC, contributions to groups opposing Trump, and get out the vote programs in swing states.” ||||| Buy Photo A billboard at Interstate 94 near the Detroit-Dearborn border reads, in Arabic: “Donald Trump, he can’t read this, but he is scared of it anyway.” (Photo: John T. Greilick / The Detroit News)Buy Photo A group that taps humor and risque comments in a popular card game is reaching out to Metro Detroiters with a serious message via old-school advertising. The Nuisance Committee, based in Chicago, recently placed an anti-Donald Trump billboard along westbound Interstate 94 near Dearborn. It’s expected to stay up through Election Day. Written mostly in Arabic, the sign reads: “Donald Trump, he can’t read this, but he is scared of it anyway,” according to Kitty Kurth, spokeswoman for the Nuisance Committee, which was started by founders of the game Cards Against Humanity. “It’s tongue-in-cheek with a serious message behind the comedy.” The billboard was placed near Dearborn because of its large Arab-American population, according to the committee. The Republican presidential nominee has come under fire for his comments regarding Muslims. Another reason is that Michigan is a key swing state. “Those were the two major factors that impacted our decision,” said Melissa Harris, spokeswoman for the committee. Hello! We’ve got complete midterm election coverage right here. Let’s begin! Dawud Walid, executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said he sees the humor in the Dearborn billboard. “I chuckled,” said Walid, recalling the first time he saw it. “I laughed. Duh. This is how people feel in the community. It’s mocking Trump. It’s funny yet very appropriate considering the nonsense Donald Trump has continued to say about Muslims.” Tim Lineberger, Michigan communications director for Trump, said Monday night he did not have an official statement regarding the billboard. The billboard is among a few the committee has placed around the country, including one in Chicago that reads: “If Trump is so rich how come he didn’t buy this billboard?” and directs people to trumpdoesntpaytaxes.com. Another billboard in Orlando shows a cartoon likeness of Trump sitting at a computer and states: “Donald Trump Mains Hanzo and complains about team comp in chat.” For those that aren’t hip to gamer lingo, Harris said the billboard means that Trump only plays one character (in this case Hanzo, a non-versatile character from the game “Overwatch”). The billboard directs people to trumpisnotateamplayer.com. “One of the reasons we’re using some unconventional ways to talk about the election is to reach out to younger voters who might not be focusing on the more conventional ways,” Kurth said. The black-and-white billboard in Dearborn directs people to trumpisscared.org. It cost 4,850 to erect the billboard, Harris said. Funds are raised through sales of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump card packs from Cards Against Humanity’s America Votes website. There are more ad campaigns on the way through Election Day, so stay tuned, Kurth said. “We’ve got our fingers in a lot of pots, stirring things up,” she said. The group does not have any pro-Clinton campaigns but the group has been verbal in its support of the Democratic presidential nominee. “We very much support Hillary Clinton, and we think she’s a great candidate,” Harris said. “We think she’s experienced. We think she’s qualified. We trust her with the country’s nuclear weapons. We’re not worried about her controlling the button so to speak.” Walid said the anti-Trump sentiment on the billboard is felt by a vast amount of Arab-Americans and Muslims in Metro Detroit. “It is stating a feeling ... that Donald Trump has been a fearmonger about communities he really doesn’t know,” Walid said. “What I’ve been hearing on the streets of Detroit and Dearborn ... I have not spoken to a person yet that they’re going to vote for (Trump) in this upcoming election. The general statements are he’s just a racist bigot and not just against people of the Islamic faith, but he made comments against Latinos and women.” Nabih Ayad, founder of the Arab-American Civil Rights League, said he has not seen the sign, but said he believes it is a stand against bigotry and hate. He said its placement near Dearborn is appropriate. “It’s obviously targeted to the Arab and Muslim community,” he said. “It’s a call for unity in that we will not take the political rhetoric that is happening here. We’ve been at the ground zero of hate and rhetoric since 9/11. We’ve seen over and over the rhetoric does not stand. Americans have to choose bigotry or unification. We are a nation of immigrants. We cannot forget that.” Imad Hamad, longtime activist for the Metro Detroit Arab and Muslim community, and president of the American Human Rights Council, offered his take on the sign Monday. “The sign is a sarcastic message about Donald Trump judging the Arab and Muslim community without understanding what it’s about,” he said. “This says, ‘You can’t read it because it’s a strange language, but you’re still scared of it; you hate what you don’t understand.’ That’s the message of this billboard. They’re trying to showcase his ignorance of not knowing the truth about Islam, Arabs, and our heritage. You don’t know it, but you fear it.” Hamad said, however, there are some members of the local Arab, Muslim community who support Trump. “But Mr. Trump does have some support in the Arab and Muslim community,” he said. “Not much, but it’s visible. These people feel Mrs. Clinton is not presenting a compelling case to vote for her.” John Akouri, member of the American Middle East Coalition for Trump, said there are many members of the Middle Eastern Community, including himself, who support Trump. \\"... We know he is the only candidate who can bring the necessary change needed to unleash our economy and make the world a safer and more peaceful place,\\" Akouri said in a statement. \\"Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's poor judgment at home and in the Middle East has already cost us too much — we simply cannot afford what would be nothing more than a third Obama term. On the most important issues, such as jobs, the economy, education, public safety, and national security, I trust Donald Trump, a successful and straight-talking businessman, far more than I could ever trust a deceptive, career politician like Hillary Clinton.\\" cwilliams@detroitnews.com (313) 222-2311 Staff Writer George Hunter contributed.

Returning to his assistant Watson in secret, Holmes notes that all the victims were wealthy gamblers, so disguised as \\"Rajni Singh\\", a distinguished Indian officer, he stalks London's gaming clubs. It is not long before he encounters the villain of the piece, Adrea Spedding. Holmes discovers that she seeks out men short of money, persuades them to pawn their life insurance policies with her accomplices, then kills them. Holmes sets himself up as her next victim, discovering that she uses the deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, whose venom causes such excruciating pain that the victims kill themselves. Holmes also finds the footprint of a child nearby. Searching for evidence Holmes and Watson visit eminent arachnologist Matthew Ordway, who may have supplied the deadly creatures. Holmes soon realizes that the man he is speaking to is an impostor, but the villain makes his escape. Searching the premises, Holmes finds the corpse of the real Ordway, as well as his journals, which allude to something or someone from Central Africa immune to the spider venom. This baffles Holmes until he finds the model skeleton of a child. However, Dr. Watson points out that the relation of the skull and the circumference of the chest prove it is not a child, and Holmes deduces that the Central African thing described in the journal is a pygmy.

They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. David is a biologist. He was in the African savanna to study different species. Especially, he was interested in two species, rhinos and impalas. He noticed that in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats, impalas have acquired some behaviors that help them and their young. Rhinos also have acquired some behaviors in response to the same threat. But their behaviors mostly failed them in that aspect. In which species the behaviors in question would make them more fit, rhino or impala? A:","completion":"In this scenario, the behaviors in question would make the impalas more fit. Since they have acquired behaviors that help them and their young survive in response to constant human encroachment, their level of fitness has increased. These adaptive behaviors give impalas a better chance of passing on their genes to the next generation, making the behaviors more common in their species through the process of evolution by natural selection.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Fruit flies lay their eggs places that provide food and moisture, such as rotting fruit and dank sinks or garbage cans. To get rid of the eggs, you'll need to figure out where the flies' food sources are in your kitchen. Bowls or bags of aging fruit are an obvious culprit. Even if your fruit is brand new, the container you're storing it in might have residue from old produce that's still attracting fruit flies. If you keep compost in your kitchen, that may be a food source for fruit flies. An open bag of recyclables can be attractive to fruit flies, especially if it contains un-rinsed beer or soda cans. When did you last wash your garbage can? Even if you take out the trash frequently, the receptacle itself could be the source of the problem. Kitchen sink drains often harbor fruit flies, since food bits can get trapped in there and start to rot. Damp sponges and mops can also be breeding grounds for fruit flies. When you have a fruit fly problem, don't leave fruit exposed at room temperature in your kitchen. Store it in a closed brown bag or keep it in the refrigerator until you've taken care of the fruit flies. One piece of overripe fruit can perpetuate the infestation by providing a great place for fruit flies to breed. Don't throw fruit scraps in the trash. Unless you take your trash out daily, avoid throwing peach pits, apple cores and other fruit scraps in the trash in your kitchen, since they'll end up as breeding grounds for fruit flies. Take scraps directly outside to a compost pile or outdoor bin. Your trash can, recycling bin, and compost bin could be harboring fruit fly eggs. Any waste receptacle you keep indoors should be cleaned with hot, soapy water as soon as you notice the infestation. Take out your trash, recycling or compost often to prevent the problem from recurring. Continue washing the containers every week or so, especially during the late summer months when fruit fly populations are high. Rinse bottles and other containers with hot water before you throw them in the bin. Residue from these items can spill on your trash receptacles and make the fruit fly problem worse. You should also make sure all of your waste receptacles have tight-fitting lids. You can check to see if your drain is a fruit fly breeding ground by covering it with a piece of plastic wrap spread with a thin layer of honey. Place it over the drain honey-side down, then come back in an hour or so. If you see fruit flies stuck to the honey, your drain is part of the problem. Make sure your drain is operating properly. If it's backed up, or if your garbage disposal isn't working, you might have bits of rotting fruit attracting flies down there. To kill eggs, pour a pot of boiling soapy water down the drain. Use a brush to scrub around the sides of the drain. Don't pour bleach down your drain. It doesn't work, and it's harmful to the environment. Old sponges, damp mops, old rags, and any other items you use to wipe your counters and floors might contain fruit fly eggs. Throw them away or wash them using the hot cycle on your washing machine. Use hot, soapy water to clean your countertops. Make sure you get all the cracks and crevices where fruit flies might like to congregate. Clean your cabinets, pantry, and any other places where you've stored fruit, juices, or other sugary items. Check the floor, too. If a drink got spilled under the refrigerator, for instance, that might be part of the problem. Clean any areas that feel sticky. Keep kitchen surfaces clean every day. Make sure everything is wiped down as part of your cleanup after each meal. Wash all dishes after use. Avoid leaving dishes just sitting around dirty (if you have a dishwasher, pop them in there and shut the door to await a wash).

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, also called RodeoHouston or abbreviated HLSR, is the largest livestock exhibitions and rodeo in the world. It also includes one of the richest regular-season rodeo events. It has been held at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, since 2003. It was previously held in the Astrodome. Since 1952, traditional trail rides have been a part of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. As of 2017, there were 13 official trail rides, totaling over 3,000 riders. The trail rides range in size from a dozen to over one thousand people who ride on horseback or in horse-drawn wagons from various areas of the state to Houston. They make their way at about 3 miles (4.8 km) per hour, covering up to 17 miles (27 km) each day. Many of the routes take place in part along major highways and busy city streets, making safety a major concern. The trail rides last from a few days to three weeks, depending on the distance they cover. Some of the participants are able to join only on weekends or at the end of the trip. The days start very early, and often end with live music or a small celebration. Many riders choose to camp in recreational vehicles rather than in the open. Each morning, they drive their vehicles and horse trailers to the next camping spot, then have a bus or convoy take them back so they can retrace their path on horseback. Participants can bring their own provisions, or, in some cases, purchase meals at a chuck wagon that is also following the trail. The rides converge at Memorial Park in Houston on Go Texan Day, the Friday before the livestock show and rodeo begins. The city closes some roads downtown to allow the riders to reach their destination safely. The resulting traffic interruption cause annual complaints from those who work downtown. The following day, all of the trail riders participate in the parade. are the trail rides open to the public?","completion":"Yes, the trail rides during the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo are open to the public.

A U.S. Marine who lost both his legs in Afghanistan just three weeks after being deployed and suffered from crippling depression as a result has managed to heroically complete the Chicago marathon this weekend. Using a hand bike, ultra-competitive Ben Maenza, 24, finished the 26.2 mile race only two years after he lost both limbs and credits his recovery to a religious experience during which he came to know that he could not give up despite wanting to end it all. 'People think you can’t do stuff like that without your legs, so being out there and proving that you can and making it happen, it’s really gratifying,' said Maenza before he completed the 26.2 mile race in one-hour 48 minutes. Scroll Down for Video. Lance Cpl. Ben Maenza rides his specially designed bike that has allowed him to compete in two marathons and cross the country since an accident two-years ago robbed him of his legs. Lance Cpl. Maenza, from Nashville, Tennessee, had not yet completed a full month of his deployment working as a combat engineer in the Marine Corps, when he lost his legs in a horrific accident. 'We were walking through a cornfield and came to a river we needed to cross,' said Maenza to ABC News. 'I felt it was a bad idea, but we did it anyway. It was my job to clear the trail. 'I was standing on the riverbed, and the guy behind me stepped off my trail and hit a pressure plate that was offset from an improvised explosive device (IED) that I was standing on top of. 'The bomb detonated underneath me.' Marine Ben Maenza, who lost both legs when he was injured in Afghanistan in 2010, bicycles through the Florida as he makes his way across the country in June of 2012. Runners leave the starting line during the 2012 Chicago Marathon on Sunday. The explosion caused Maenza to instantly lose both his legs and to suffer deep gashes, burns and nerve damage to his arms in addition to nasal and skull fractures. Technically dying in the field, the quick actions of a medic ensured that Maenza was resuscitated, after which he was rushed to a military hospital in Germany where he began an 18-month rehabilitation process. However, despite surviving the explosion, Maenza entered into a deep depression. 'You don’t know where you’re going to go – you just know you lost your legs and emotionally, mentally, life’s over,' said Maenza to Fox News. 'There’s nothing to live for.' The 24-year-old Lance Cpl. spent 18-months in recovery after his October 2010 accident and has since taken part in two marathons. Lance Cpl. Maenza, from Nashville, Tennessee, had not yet completed a full month of his deployment working as a combat engineer in the Marine Corps, when he lost his legs in a horrific accident. Stuck in a terrible rut for six-months, Maenza started to pull through after he had a religious experience. 'I had a divine intervention with God,' said Maenza. 'This wasn’t what my life was going to be like. Losing my legs was not going to determine who I was going to be. 'I died – they had to bring me back to life – I got this second chance, and I wasn’t going to settle for mediocrity.' It was while hospitalised at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, Maenza was introduced to representatives from Achilles International, an organisation which helps people with extreme disabilities compete in mainstream athletics. 'Achilles came in and said, 'Hey, we don't feel sorry for you because we know you can do better than this, you are not just a patient in this hospital, you are an athlete; you are a competitor,' said Maenza. Achilles International, an organisation which helps people with extreme disabilities compete in mainstream athletics. has helped Ben to recover his drive to live life and to compete. The non-profit organisation was founded in 1983 and funds the Freedom Team of Wounded Veterans - and encouraged Maenza to compete in two marathons and to cycle across the nation from Florida to California. 'It was exactly what I needed at that point in my recovery,' said the injured veteran to WKRN. 'I was at a crossroads. They came in and gave me a way to get a sense of accomplishment. 'It gives you something to work towards, the knowledge that you are capable and you can do it.' 'I never really was a runner or a cyclist before, but when Achilles approached me and asked me to do it, it kind of lit a fire in me and, quite frankly, I’m pretty good at it.' Ben Maenza still keeps in contact with his U.S. Marine Corp friends - and is pictured here with two in the gym. Despite finishing the race in under two hours, Maenza was not totally happy with his performance. 'Obviously, I was a little slower than I intended, but I’ve got a good excuse, my wheel was broken,' said Maenza. 'Now I’m going to continue to train harder and push to the limit. I can use it as motivation for my next race.' Now studying for a college degree, Maenza takes inspiration from his progress over the past two years. 'The message is, with the right attitude and determination, you can succeed anything that’s put in your way,' said Maenza. 'Life’s not over if you lost your legs, or you have diabetes, or you’re overweight, whatever. 'No matter what you’re faced with, you can do great things. I just want people to know if we can do it, they can do it.'

On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs.

Index fossils help scientists estimate the age of a rock because index fossil species only existed for a relatively short time. What happened to the species that are now used as index fossils? OPT: I. They became extinct. II. They changed their diets. III. They hid in marine sediments. IV. They migrated to new environments.","completion":"Index fossils are used by scientists to correlate and date rock layers across different regions. Fossil species used as index fossils are those that existed for relatively short periods of time. To determine what happened to these species, let's examine the options provided: I. They became extinct: Index fossils are usually derived from species that evolved rapidly and then became extinct. Their limited time range allows scientists to date particular layers of rocks with greater accuracy. Their extinction ensures that their presence in a rock layer can be used as a unique time marker. II. They changed their diets: While a species might change its diet over time, this is generally unrelated to their status as index fossils. The defining feature of index fossils is their relatively brief time of existence, not changes in their diets. III. They hid in marine sediments: Index fossils are derived from once-living organisms that were buried in sediment and eventually turned into fossils. They didn't actively hide in marine sediments; rather, their remains became part of the sediments, where they were preserved as fossils. IV. They migrated to new environments: Some species may have migrated to new environments, but this does not affect their status as index fossils. Again, the key feature of index fossils is their brief time of existence, which allows scientists to use them as a dating tool. In conclusion, the species that are now used as index fossils generally became extinct (Option I), which is why their presence in a rock layer serves as a unique time marker. Other factors, such as changes in diet, hiding in sediments, or migration, do not contribute significantly to their status as index fossils."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Tom and Jim go running together once a week.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You may love a character, and think you could cosplay her perfectly, but if she’s not very well known, you’re not likely to get much of a response from other people. The best characters to cosplay as are iconic and distinctive. They don't need to be the most well-known characters, but you will want at least a fraction of convention attendees to know who you're playing as. If being seen as attractive is your priority, think about which characters members of the fan community are most attracted to, and which ones you find most beautiful. Cosplay means costume art to some, but truly dedicated cosplayers act out their character. This requires having a solid knowledge of the character's motivations, history and psychology. Look into the source material and give yourself a crash course in the character. Ask yourself questions and try to answer them yourself. What is her darkest secret? How would she react to a stranger? What hobbies does she have? These may not have a big effect on the character's personality, but it helps you get into the proper mindset. For example, if you're going as Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion, watch the anime and observe the way she thinks, moves, and talks. Note her character arc. To be a great cosplayer, you should be able to capture the essence of your character in a single pose. Without movement or talking, frame your body in such a way that expresses something of the character's personality. Practice some poses in front of the mirror and see if something sticks. If you're having a trouble finding one that really works, try looking up artwork or promo photos for the character you're cosplaying as and copy it. For instance, a battle-ready stance might suit a character from an action-adventure series, like Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts. Poses are best-suited for photo ops. If your costume is impressive enough, you're bound to get a lot of attention. Having a few good poses will help you look better in photos. Unfortunately, for all of the great things conventions can offer, they are also notorious for attracting haters and creeps. Dressing up as an attractive anime girl can be an open invitation for some of these less desirable types. If someone like this approaches you or makes a comment you're not comfortable with, the best thing you can do is ignore it and walk away. Nothing breaks character like genuine stress, and you don't want negative feelings to get in the way of your convention experience. If someone is persistently harassing you, contact security or con-ops immediately. Cosplay if ultimately about expressing yourself, and the best way to do that is through confidence. If you're confident about what you're doing, the cosplay act will come more naturally. Of course, this may be easier said than done for a lot of people. Confidence is not the sort of thing that happens overnight. Nonetheless, you should pat yourself on the back for the fact alone you are putting yourself out there via cosplay. Cosplay takes courage, and simply being interested in doing it means you've got what it takes.","completion":"The article provides tips for successful cosplay, emphasizing the importance of choosing iconic and distinctive characters, understanding their motivations and psychology, practicing poses for photos, and dealing with potential harassment while maintaining confidence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less wind happens, how will it affect more spores are carried by the wind. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the process and its components The process described involves the growth and reproduction of mushrooms through spore production and dispersal. The main components/steps are: 1. Adult mushrooms produce spores 2. Release spores into the air through sporulation 3. Spores are carried by the wind 4. Spores land in a suitable growing environment 5. Spores germinate in the soil 6. Mushrooms grow 7. Adult mushrooms produce spores, and the process repeats Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that there will be less wind, potentially affecting spore dispersal and the number of spores carried by the wind. Step 3: Determine the direct effect of the perturbation on the process In this case, less wind will directly affect step 3: spore dispersal. With reduced wind, spore dispersal may be less efficient, leading to fewer spores being carried away from the parent mushroom and covering shorter distances. Step 4: Determine the indirect effects of the perturbation on the process The decrease in spore dispersal efficiency due to reduced wind may have several indirect effects on the mushroom growth and reproduction process. They are: 1. Reduced probability of spores landing in suitable growing environments (step 4) 2. Diminished genetic diversity due to spores not being able to reach distant environments 3. An increased risk of local overcrowding and competition for resources among offspring Step 5: Summarize the effects of the perturbation hypothesis on the process In conclusion, the perturbation of less wind would directly affect the spore dispersal step in the mushroom growth and reproduction process. This could lead to indirect effects such as a reduced probability of spores landing in suitable growing environments, decreased genetic diversity, and increased local competition for resources among offspring. Therefore, the perturbation hypothesis does have both direct and indirect effects on the mushroom growth and reproduction process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Director of the US-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, Greg Scarlatoiun, told Finnish daily Helsingin Sanomat that Lee’s claims sounded believable. “We have been told similar stories in the past that human experiments are carried out in prison camps,” he explained. Scarlatoiun added that it was likely the data would include evidence that North Korea had been chemical weapons on humans.

AP Finland’s Foreign Ministry told the Helsingin Samomat that it could not confirm whether Lee had entered the country, or comment on his plans to take evidence to parliament. Officially, North Korea claims that it does not have chemical weapons. But according to research by the US Korea Institute at SAIS published by 38North – the nation produces 20 different chemicals for use in weapons. Though obtaining precise figures is difficult, it is thought that North Korea produced 4,500 tonnes of chemical agents in peacetime and 12,000 in wartime. Lee is not the first defector to make claims of the unethical nature of the country’s testing methods. In December 2014 a former officer of the special forces came forward said how the regime was testing chemical and biological weapons on disabled children and adults. ||||| A North Korean scientist who was involved in the regime's biological and chemical weapons programmes has defected to Finland , apparently with evidence of tests carried out on human subjects. The researcher, who has only been identified by his surname, Lee, was based at a microbiology research centre in Ganggye, close to the Chinese border, but defected on June 6, South Korea 's Yonhap news agency reported. Mr Lee, 47, fled to Finland via the Philippines, according to a group that campaigns for human rights in North Korea, on the grounds that he \\"felt sceptical about his research\\". Mr Lee was carrying an electronic data storage device allegedly containing 15 gigabytes of information on North Korea's use of humans being used to test biological and chemical weapons. He is planning to give testimony to the European parliament in late July in order to highlight the North's abuses of its own people, the rights group said. • Kim Jong-un takes pity on illegitimate half-uncle his own father persecuted Over the years, there have been a number of reports of North Korean scientists utilising humans for weapons tests. Im Cheon-yong, for example, was an officer in North Korea's special forces until he defected in the mid-1990s. During debriefing, he told South Korean intelligence officials that the final straw was seeing mentally and physically children with disabilities, being used in chemical weapons tests as part of his training. \\"If you want to graduate from this academy, you need to learn how to confuse the enemy without revealing your own forces, how to carry out assassinations, how to use chemical weapons and so on,\\" he said in an interview in 2014. \\"And then we have what they call 'field learning'. \\"For the biological and chemical warfare tests, we needed 'objects',\\" he said. \\"At first, they used the chemical agents on mice and showed us how they died. Then we watched the instructors carrying out the tests on humans to show us how a person dies. I saw it with my own eyes.\\" Mr Im said tests were conducted at least three facilities operated by the military, including one alongside a political prison camp close to the city of Hyanghari. Anthrax bacterium is frequently tested, along with as many as 40 different types of chemical weapons that the North Korean regime has concocted itself. In February, South Korean intelligence warned that Pyongyang has stepped up its biological and chemical warfare drills, carrying out at least a dozen large-scale exercises in the previous year. • North Korea v South Korea: How the countries' armed forces compare \\"These are clearly offensive drills planning a biochemical attack,\\" a South Korean officer told the Chosun Ilbo newspaper. \\"We believe it could cause a real threat.\\" A report issued in 2014 by 38 North, the respected web site operated by the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, suggested that North Korea devotes a substantial amount of its resources to developing chemical weapons. Based on testimony from North Korean soldiers who have defected, the study claims that North Korea is able to manufacture 4,500 tons of chemical agents a year, but has the capacity to ramp that up to 12,000 tons a year. The chemicals that the regime is producing include hydrogen cyanide, phosgene, sarin, tabun, chlorine and a number of agents from the mustard gas family. The study also cited former prison inmates and guards as saying that chemical and biological weapons are tested on North Korean political prisoners at special camps. The report added that North Korea has reportedly provided chemical weapons or technology to Egypt, Iran, Libya and Syria since the 1990s. • North Korea threatens nuclear strike on White House Coming after United Nations investigations into North Korea's human rights abuses, Mr Lee's testimony before the European parliament will be closely watched. \\"The international community will have to collect the data and, if it can be verified that such experiments have taken place, then that would seem to violate international humanitarian law,\\" Daniel Pinkston, an analyst with The International Crisis Group in Seoul, told the Telegraph. \\"After that, it is up to the international community to do everything in its power to prevent this happening again, to terminate these programmes and to hold those responsible for carrying them out accountable for their actions,\\" he said. North Korea is already the subject of UN sanctions and it is not clear what further steps might be taken to halt the reported use of its citizens in North Korea's biological and chemical weapons tests. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A North Korean expert on biochemical weapons defected to Finland last month, carrying gigabytes of human experiment results with him, a source said Thursday.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Mother and Son Movie plot: \\"Mother and Son\\" (1997) is a love story, not of the \\"Romeo and Juliette\\" or \\"Tristan and Isolde\\" type, but rather regarding the profound emotional ties that exist between a mother and her son. The film calls for amazing optical effects and sounds in order to develop a cinematographic poetry. \\"Mother and Son\\" is the first part of a trilogy that has for its subject matter the study of the drama in human relationships. It is followed by \\"Father and Son\\" (2003), and by \\"Two Brothers and a Sister,\\" the final installment, which is in its preliminary filming stage.The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail, old woman. They recline in a silence penetrated only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted, sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey, from her sick-bed to her death-bed. It is a circular motion, which travels a long walk through a dream-like landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous ski of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the worldThey return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed, which now seems to resemble a coffin. Both know that the end is nearing, although he tries to reassure... My question: Are the two surrounded by people or isolated?

Their emotional journey takes place against the backdrop of a dream-like landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. As they make brief stops on their journey, moments of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs are shared between them, emphasizing the deep bond they share. The film's setting further highlights their isolation from the rest of the world. They are shown navigating through the leaden and luminous skies of the Baltic, with occasional glimpses of faraway trains or sails on the sea serving to emphasize their seclusion even more. In this isolated environment, the focus remains on the profound emotional ties between the mother and her son, as he cares for her during her final days, until her eventual death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On weekends, Bobby hangs out in the company of Elton, with whom he bowls, gets drunk, and has sex with other women. Bobby has evidently not told anyone that he is a former classical pianist who comes from an eccentric family of musicians.When Rayette becomes pregnant and his friend Elton is arrested and sent to jail for having robbed a gas station a year earlier, Bobby quits his job and leaves for Los Angeles where his older sister, Partita (Lois Smith), also a pianist, is making a recording. Partita informs him that their father, from whom he is estranged, has suffered two strokes and is now an invalid.

Paragraph: Before the establishment of the People's Republic, Albania's illiteracy rate was as high as 85%. Schools were scarce between World War I and World War II. When the People's Republic was established in 1945, the Party gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy. As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population. Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male literacy rate is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%. With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas, the provision of education has undergone transformation as well. The University of Tirana is the oldest university in Albania, having been founded in October 1957.

Why is 1MB is equal to 1010KB? Why not 1MB is equal to 1000tKB? Now that everyone knows the error that 1k is equal to 1024 and not 1000, why is it not corrected in optical memory devices? Please tell me if those questions are the same. OPTIONS: (i). no. (ii). yes.","completion":"The reason 1 MB is equal to 1024 KB and not 1000 KB is due to how storage capacities are calculated in computing systems that use binary numeral systems. The binary numeral system uses base-2 representation, which means each digit corresponds to powers of 2. Let me explain this disparity in more detail. In the metric numeral system that we use every day, we have the base-10 representation, where each unit increases by a factor of 10. For example, 1 kilogram (kg) equals 1000 grams (g), and 1 megagram (Mg) equals 1000 kilograms (kg). However, computers use a base-2 representation or binary representation. In this system, each unit increases by a factor of 2^10 or 1024. To represent the relationship between different storage units in the binary system, we use a prefix system similar to the metric system. For example, K (kilo) represents 2^10 or 1024, M (mega) represents 2^20 or 1024^2, G (giga) represents 2^30 or 1024^3, and so on. This means that 1 MB is equal to 1024 KB, because it is defined as 2^20 bytes, and 1 KB is 2^10 bytes: 1 MB = 2^20 bytes 1 KB = 2^10 bytes 1 MB = (2^20 / 2^10) KB = 1024 KB The reason this hasn't been changed in optical memory devices is that using the base-2 system is more suitable for addressing memory and representing data in computer systems. It makes it possible to use efficient algorithms and hardware designs for handling memory and data storage. Also, it's important to maintain consistency throughout the field of computer science and engineering. However, to avoid confusion between the base-2 measurements and the metric system, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) introduced new prefixes for binary multiples in 1998. The new prefixes are kibi (Ki), mebi (Mi), gibi (Gi), tebi (Ti), and so on. These are now recommended for use when expressing binary storage capacities. According to this notation, 1 MiB (mebibyte) is equal to 1024 KiB (kibibytes) and 1 MB (megabyte) is equal to 1000 KB (kilobytes). To address your final question, both questions are related as they discuss the same topic, which is the discrepancy between the base-2 representation in computing storage and the base-10 representation used in everyday metric units.

This thing in Boston, they really made something out of nothing,\\" Bryant said. \\"There’s nothing I said that was out of the ordinary or that I haven’t said before in talking to him.\\" Bryant also said in that story that Howard needs to grasp the Lakers' tradition: \\"It's win a championship or everything is a complete failure. That's just how [the Lakers] do it. And that's foreign to him.\\" On Saturday, however, Bryant seemed to defend Howard, who has been slowed by a shoulder injury and numbness in his legs after undergoing back surgery last April. \\"All year, [media] people have been trying to hang on to stuff. He's just got to go do his job — just rebound and defend,\\" Bryant said. \\"We do our jobs and our roles in what we have to do to help us win. It's not rocket science. \\"He's doing the best he can. Obviously he's limited in what he can do for us as opposed to what he was doing when he was in Orlando but he's still giving it a good effort.\\" Howard's father, Dwight Sr., was critical of the whole Lakers experience in an interview with the Atlanta-Journal Constitution. Dwight Jr. grew up in Atlanta and still has family members there. \\"I told him before he said it publicly, 'It's your career. No person can say what you need to do or not do. You can't worry about what Kobe or anybody else says,' \\" Howard's father told the paper. \\"Nobody can say what Kobe said -- that's stepping into another man's shoes. I understand what Kobe was trying to do, but he went about it the wrong way. He's trying to win a championship. But Dwight has to tell Kobe, 'I appreciate your opinion, but that doesn't matter. We're two men on this team. We need to be reasonable about this.' \\" Then the elder Howard's thoughts turned to D'Antoni, currently 19-22 since joining the Lakers. \\"The problem is the coach. [D’Antoni] needs to step in and say, 'You guys have got to be quiet. We're trying to secure something here,' \\" Dwight Sr. said. \\"Dwight is probably looking at the coach, thinking, 'What are you going to do?' I think the coach has a lot to do with who controls Kobe's mouth right now.\\" Earlier this week, after Bryant talked about the need for urgency and for Howard to return, Howard wasn't happy. His simple phrase at the time -- \\"He's not a doctor\\" -- won accolades from his father. \\"When he spoke up, he asked me what I thought, and I told him I applaud him for standing up for himself,\\" Dwight Sr. said. \\"But I still think he needs to have a sit-down with the coach and Kobe.\\" Said Dwight of his father: \\"My dad is a grown man. That's how he feels. We'll leave it at that.\\" Howard declined to comment about his father's belief that he would probably re-sign with the Lakers when free agency began in July. \\"I'm not getting into it,\\" he said.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The cooking process generates so much heat that the magnetic minerals in these stones will realign themselves with the current field direction. An archaeological search is under way in New Zealand to find sites containing old ovens, or hangi as they are known. Abandoned stones at these locations could shed light on Earth's magnetic behaviour going back hundreds of years. \\"We have very good palaeomagnetic data from across the world recording field strength and direction - especially in the Northern Hemisphere,\\" said Gillian Turner from Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand. \\"The southwest Pacific is the gap, and in order to complete global models, we're rather desperate for good, high-resolved data from our part of the world,\\" she told BBC News. Dr Turner was speaking here at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall meeting, the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists. The NZ researcher is working on a project to retrieve information about changes in the Earth's magnetic field stretching back over the past 10,000 years. For data on the last few centuries, she would ordinarily have turned to pottery. When these objects are fired, the minerals in their clay are heated above the Curie temperature and are demagnetised. Then, as the pots cool down, those minerals become magnetised again in the direction of the prevalent field. And the strength of the magnetisation is directly related to the strength of that field. Unfortunately for Dr Turner, the first settlers on New Zealand 700-800 years ago - the Maori - did not use pottery. However, the researcher has hit upon a fascinating alternative. She is now exploiting the Maori cooking tradition of the steam oven. These were pits in the ground into which were placed very hot stones, covered with baskets of food and layers of fern fronds soaked in water. The whole construction was then topped with soil and left to cook for several hours. Dr Turner and colleagues experimented with a modern-day hangi to see if the stones at the base of the pit could achieve the necessary Curie temperatures to reset their magnetisation - to prove they could be used as an alternative data source for their study. \\"The Maori legend is that the stones achieve white hot heat,\\" she explained. \\"Well, red hot is about 700 degrees and so white hot would be a good deal more than that. But by putting some thermocouples in the stones we were able to show they got as high as 1,100C, which of itself is quite surprising. At that temperature, rock-forming minerals start to become plastic if not melt.\\" By placing a compass on top of the cooled hangi stones Dr Turner's team was able to establish that a re-magnetisation had indeed taken place. It turns out that hangi stones were carefully chosen, and one of the most popular types was an andesite boulder found in Central North Island. \\"The Maori prefer these volcanic boulders because they don't crack and shatter in the fire, and from our point of view they're the best because magnetically they behave better - they're formed with a high concentration of magnetite,\\" the Wellington scientist said. \\"But there are some sedimentary rocks which we can use also.\\" Dr Turner's team is now scouring New Zealand for archaeological digs that have uncovered hangi ovens. It is crucial that a date is recovered with the stones. This can be provided by a radiocarbon analysis of the charcoal left from the firewood used to light the oven. Hangi stones are only likely to take Dr Turner back to the 1200s. For magnetic data deeper in time, she needs to go to other sources. \\"We're also studying volcanic rocks because they're erupted above the Curie temperature. And the other source of information is lake sediments. Long-core sediments can give us a continuous record at specific places.\\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos This article was about:","completion":"This article discusses an innovative research approach undertaken by Dr. Gillian Turner and her team from Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, who are using the ancient Maori cooking tradition of steam ovens, or hangi, to study the changes in Earth's magnetic field over the past centuries.

The traditional Maori steam oven was a pit in the ground filled with hot stones, covered with baskets of food and layers of water-soaked fern fronds, and topped with soil to cook for several hours.

Choices: - cooking takes a while - necessary to live - edible - kitchen - unhealthy The rationale to choose \\"necessary to live\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The rationale to choose \\"necessary to live\\" as the answer is based on the fact that eating food is essential for the survival and well-being of humans. Food provides the body with the nutrients, energy, and hydration needed to maintain physical health, repair damaged cells, and support mental and cognitive functions. Although one might not always enjoy the food they eat, the body still requires nutrition to carry on its essential processes. Here is a breakdown of the other choices and why they do not provide a suitable rationale: - Cooking takes a while: Although cooking can be time-consuming, it is not the primary reason people eat food they do not like. This choice fails to address the fundamental necessity of food for survival and well-being. - Edible: While it is true that edible food can be consumed, this choice does not explain why people would eat food they do not like. It merely states that the food can be eaten, without addressing the core issue concerning the necessity of nutrition for body functions. - Kitchen: This choice seems unrelated to the question, as it refers to a location (where food is typically prepared) rather than providing a rationale for eating food one does not like. It does not address the necessity of food consumption for survival. - Unhealthy: Unhealthy food can contribute to poor health outcomes in the long run, but this choice does not address why people would eat food they dislike. If anything, disliking unhealthy food might encourage healthier eating habits, so it does not provide a valid rationale. In summary, \\"necessary to live\\" is the most appropriate answer because it highlights the fundamental role of food in providing essential energy and nutrients for the body to function and survive. While one might not always enjoy their meals, consuming food is necessary for maintaining overall health and well-being.

At least 20 people were killed and 200 more were injured Friday in the northern Mediterranean city of Benghazi, Libya's second-largest, said a medical source in Benghazi who was not identified for security reasons. The casualties occurred as thousands of Libyans took to the streets to voice their discontent over leader Moammar Gadhafi, witnesses said. Friday's killings brought to 50 the number of people killed since Tuesday, when the protests began, the medical source said. Amnesty International said security forces had killed at least 46 during the past three days, with sources at al-Jala Hospital in Benghazi saying that the most common injuries were bullet wounds to the head, chest and neck. \\"The alarming rise in the death toll, and the reported nature of victims' injuries, strongly suggests that security forces are permitted to use lethal force against unarmed protesters calling for political change,\\" said Malcolm Smart, the Amnesty's director for the Middle East and North Africa. CNN was unable to independently verify the information. In front of the main courthouse in a square in Benghazi, thousands of demonstrators filled the streets demanding a change of government, a protester said. He said people were chanting for Gadhafi and his children to get out of Libya. He called Gadhafi's authoritarian rule \\"the biggest dictatorship in history.\\" Late Friday, a witness said more people were still streaming into the already crowded plaza, with some erecting tents, apparently planning to spend the night. There was no sign in the square of police or military forces except for the presence of three tanks, which were not moving, he said. Another source said that he saw three Libyan army tanks in the square and that young demonstrators were engaging the tank crews in conversation. He said government forces were not visible in or around Benghazi. He added that he visited Al-Jala hospital and that it was \\"full of dead and wounded.\\" Electricity was lost in parts of the city but had been restored by late Friday, when the city was quiet, he said. Farther east, in al-Baida, thousands of people showed up to bury 13 protesters killed in clashes in recent days, said Mohamed Abdallah of the opposition National Front for the Salvation of Libya, who has been receiving information about Libya from sources there. Plainclothes members of the Revolutionary Committee had reportedly fired at the protesters, Abdallah said. Demonstrations unfolded Friday in other cities as well, he said. CNN has not been permitted to report from Libya and cannot confirm information about the demonstrations. The government maintains tight control of the news media and telephone services, and many people expressed fear of talking openly amid what they described as a climate of fear. CNN has been relying on information from protesters, human rights groups and foreign-based Libyan organizations assessing the situation through their sources on the ground. Libyan state-run television was airing taped images of Gadhafi surrounded by adoring crowds. The demonstrations erupted Tuesday after the detention of a human rights lawyer and spread across the country. U.S. President Barack Obama condemned the government crackdowns in Libya, Bahrain and Yemen, which are all embroiled in unrest. \\"Wherever they are, people have certain universal rights, including the right to peaceful assembly,\\" Obama said. \\"The United States urges the governments of Bahrain, Libya and Yemen to show restraint in responding to peaceful protests, and to respect the rights of their people.\\" \\"The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Moammar Gadhafi's brutal rule when faced with any internal dissent,\\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director for Human Rights Watch. Navi Pillay, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, also condemned the crackdown in Libya and other countries \\"as illegal and excessively heavy-handed.\\" Abdallah, the spokesman for the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, reported that protesters in Benghazi had freed people who had been detained during the first two days of the unrest. He said protesters also set afire a police station and the Revolutionary Committee headquarters in Benghazi, al-Baida and Darna. Gadhafi's regime, however, has sought to portray a different picture of events and sent out tacit warnings via mobile phone texts to Libyans planning to make their voices known. \\"The inappropriate use of telecommunications services contradicts our religion ... our customs ... and our traditions,\\" said a text from the General Communications Body. Another said: \\"We commend the conscious youth who have realized that sedition destroys his family, his city, his country. And we commend our cities who have realized that touching national unity destroys the prospects of future generations. Together for the sake of the Libya of Tomorrow.\\" A screen grab of the messages was sent to CNN by Abdulla Darrat, spokesman of Enough Gadhafi, a U.S.-based organization that has been in close touch with people on the streets of Libya. State-run television countered the anti-government protests with coverage of pro-Gadhafi demonstrations. It showed men chanting pro-Gadhafi slogans, waving flags and singing around the Libyan leader's limousine as it crept through Tripoli. Scores of supportive demonstrators packed the roadway and held up pictures of their leader as fireworks burst into the night sky. The images followed reports from protesters, witnesses and human rights activists who described brutality by internal security forces, sometimes dressed in plain clothes. One of the protesters likened the situation in Libya to that which occurred early this month in Egypt, telling Human Rights Watch that \\"they are sending baltaqiyyas (thugs) to beat us.\\" Libya, like many of its Arab neighbors, is suffering from economic hardship and a lack of political reform. Youth unemployment is high. Gadhafi is acutely aware of popular grievances and has spoken with groups of students, lawyers and journalists in the past few weeks, a source told CNN this week. CNN's Yousuf Basil, Fionnuala Sweeney, Ben Wedeman and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"In the city of Benghazi in Libya, there were protests against the leader, Moammar Gadhafi. Unfortunately, at least 20 people were killed and 200 more were hurt during the protests. People are unhappy with Gadhafi's rule and want him to leave. In other cities, there were also protests and some violence.

Article: The photograph of the glasses the Beatle was wearing when he was shot dead on 8 Dec 1980 carries a message reminding people that, since then, more than a million people have been killed by guns in the USA. She sent the image out four times in quick succession yesterday, on the 44th anniversary of their marriage. The image was retweeted more than 8,000 times. The artist and peace activist, 79, claimed that guns were turning the country into a warzone. In one of the tweets accompanying the image she wrote: “The death of a loved one is a hollowing experience. After 33 years our son Sean and I still miss him. Yoko Ono Lennon.” One of her tweets repeated the message that was superimposed on the moving image, reading: “Over 1,057,000 people have been killed by guns in the USA since John Lennon was shot and killed on 8 Dec 1980.” While the others said: “31,537 people are killed by guns in the USA every year. We are turning this beautiful country into war zone. “Together, let's bring back America, the green land of peace.” The image of his glasses with Central Park in the background was also featured on the cover of her 1981 album Season of Glass, her first solo recording after Lennon was killed by Mark Chapman. The couple were married in Gibraltar on March 20, 1969, and went on honeymoon to Amsterdam, where they famously campaigned for peace by spending an entire week in bed. The gun debate in America was reignited following the Sandy Hook shootings in December last year. Ono’s calls for peace came just a day after hopes of a US assault weapon ban faded as Democrat Senate leaders dropped the proposal from a gun control bill expected to be tabled next month. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

He was driven by a fervent anti-communist stance and a more militaristic outlook than the norm at that time. Von Neumann saw the development of nuclear weapons as a key component in ensuring the US maintained a strategic advantage over its adversaries and worked towards building a powerful defense against them. His commitment to the cause was evidenced by his aggressive stance on conducting potential preemptive strikes against the Soviet Union, as indicated by his quotes from 1950.

Polished travertine often doesn't need sealing, but you don't need to guess whether or not it's a good idea. It's easy to test whether sealing is required by dropping a few drops of water in a few inconspicuous areas. Pick from: 1). Once you've accepted a stain, you can go ahead and seal the entire stone floor. A drop of water won't begin to remove stains unless the stone floor becomes saturated.. 2). Let the water stand five to ten minutes, then blot dry. If the travertine stays darker in color for more than a few minutes, sealing is probably a good idea to protect it from other liquids that could leave a permanent stain.. 3). If you notice one drop washing into a remaining area, it's probably safe to keep your travertine clean. If you see a drop or two traveling to another area, it's safe to leave your travertine clean.. 4). Dry travertine with a drop of liquid topcoat or a touch of water. Once the travertine has dried, dry it with a drop of liquid topcoat so it shines, not drips.. Answer:","completion":"2). Let the water stand five to ten minutes, then blot dry. If the travertine stays darker in color for more than a few minutes, sealing is probably a good idea to protect it from other liquids that could leave a permanent stain. Sealing your travertine can indeed be a significant step to ensure its longevity and maintain its pristine appearance. After determining that your travertine requires sealing through the water test mentioned above, you should follow these steps to properly seal the stone: 1. Choose the right sealer: Depending on your preference and budget, you can opt for a topical sealer that forms a protective film on the surface or an impregnating sealer that penetrates the stone and provides protection from within. The former may change the appearance of the stone, while the latter allows the natural beauty to shine through. 2. Clean the travertine: Before initiating the sealing process, ensure the travertine surface is clean and dry. Sweep or vacuum any loose dirt and debris. Then, use a stone-specific cleaner and a soft cloth or mop to remove any remaining stains or dirt. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as they might damage the stone. 3. Allow the stone to dry: Give the travertine sufficient time to dry completely after cleaning. Depending on the surrounding temperature and humidity levels, this may take anywhere from an hour to 24 hours. Sealing the stone while damp may trap moisture, which can cause cloudiness or discoloration. 4. Apply the sealer: Follow the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations regarding the application method and the amount of sealer to use. Using a soft cloth, brush, or roller, apply the sealer uniformly on the stone surface, taking care to avoid drips or pooling. Ensure that the entire surface is covered with the sealer. 5. Allow the sealer to penetrate: Give the sealer ample time to penetrate the stone and form a protective layer. The duration may vary depending on the sealer's type and manufacturer's guidance – it can range from a few minutes to a couple of hours. Check for any missed spots or uneven application, and touch up as required. 6. Remove excess sealer: Use a clean, dry cloth to remove any excess sealer residue that may still be on the surface of the stone. This is essential to avoid a buildup of sealer, which might result in an uneven appearance or hinder the stone's adhesion and durability. 7. Allow the sealer to cure: The sealer typically requires a certain period to dry and cure before the stone is ready for regular use. Adhere to the manufacturer's suggested curing time, which can vary from a few hours to a couple of days. By following these steps and regularly maintaining your travertine, you can enhance its durability and preserve its natural beauty for years to come. periodic resealing, as recommended by the sealer manufacturer, will ensure ongoing protection against stains and other potential damages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Question: Those who focus mainly on their career are probably: Options: - As stressed as most people - Less stressed than most people - More stressed than most people - not enough information A:","completion":"More stressed than most people"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Singer-songwriters are musicians who write, compose, and perform their own musical material, including lyrics and melodies. - Sinéad Marie Bernadette OConnor (born 8 December 1966) is an Irish singer-songwriter who rose to fame in the late 1980s with her debut album \\"The Lion and the Cobra\\".

The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others.

According to \\"Spin\\", \\"in 87 Coldcut pioneered the British fad for DJ records\\". - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Spoken word is an oral art that focuses on the aesthetics of word play and intonation and voice inflection. It is a 'catchall' that includes any kind of poetry recited aloud, including hip-hop, jazz poetry, poetry slams, traditional poetry readings and can include comedy routines and 'prose monologues'. - Dub is a genre of music that grew out of reggae in the 1960s, and is commonly considered a subgenre, though it has developed to extend beyond the scope of reggae. Music in this genre consists predominantly of instrumental remixes of existing recordings and is achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings, usually by removing the vocals from an existing music piece, and emphasizing the drum and bass parts (this stripped-down track is sometimes referred to as a 'riddim'). Other techniques include dynamically adding extensive echo, reverb, panoramic delay, and occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works. Dub was pioneered by Osbourne \\"King Tubby\\" Ruddock, Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, Errol Thompson and others in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo is credited with bringing the melodica to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside of the dancehall environment were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock (most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk), pop, hip hop, disco, and later house, techno, ambient, electronic dance music, and trip hop.

Answer the following question: I have known, and admired, Julia Busuttil Nishimura, for many years now and always felt connected through our love of Italian food, Tuscany (Julia lived in Florence and in Orbetello, just 10 minutes away from where we lived in Porto Ercole while I was writing Acquacotta) and Japan. So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already. She is a woman after my own heart. Her book inspires you to give it a go.

The company did not specify in a statement in which of its three facilities listeria had been found but said that none was found in any of its ice cream. Blue Bell said it is moving to eliminate the bacteria through a \\"seek and destroy\\" process. \\"We expect to periodically find microbiological indications in our facilities,\\" said Blue Bell, which declined comment beyond the statement. The company credited its \\"enhanced, robust testing system\\" for why it found the bacteria. The company noted that because listeria is commonly found in the natural environment, \\"no manufacturer can ever assume it will be entirely eradicated.\\" Blue Bell, ranked the No. 1 ice cream brand in the country in 2014, recalled all products last spring after 10 reported cases of listeria in four states were linked to Blue Bell frozen treats. Three of the people sickened, all hospital patients in Kansas, later died. The disease, caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and adults with weakened immune systems, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Blue Bell suspended production at its plants in Brenham, Texas; Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and Sylacauga, Alabama last spring and said it conducted a major overhaul of production at all three plants. Blue Bell laid off or furloughed hundreds of employees as a result of the shutdown. Starting in November, the company began a phased process of returning its ice cream to store shelves. The company said the next phase of the process, in which ice cream will be distributed in Tennessee, Kentucky, the Carolinas, and Virginia, will proceed as planned.

In standard Western equal temperament, the notion of pitch is insensitive to \\"spelling\\": the description \\"G4 double sharp\\" refers to the same pitch as A4; in other temperaments, these may be distinct pitches. Human perception of musical intervals is approximately logarithmic with respect to fundamental frequency: the perceived interval between the pitches \\"A220\\" and \\"A440\\" is the same as the perceived interval between the pitches A440 and A880.

Article: Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane said it wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment decision to thrust himself into a situation that has drawn national attention all week — and undoubtedly will now put him in a spotlight he hasn’t before felt. “I thought about it for a week or so and I just think it’s okay for me to do it,’’ said Lane, who sat during the national anthem before the Seahawks’ 23-21 preseason win over the Oakland Raiders on Thursday night. Lane said he did it mostly to show support for San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who sat during the anthem in a game last Friday saying he was protesting the treatment of people of color in the United States, and particularly issues with police. “I wasn’t trying to say anything, just standing behind Kaepernick,’’ said Lane, who is in his fifth year with the Seahawks after being taken in the 2012 draft. Lane, who attended Northwestern (La.) State, said he does not know Kaepernick well but that “I just liked what he’s doing and I like standing behind him.’’ Lane said he did not tell teammates or coach Pete Carroll. “Nah, I didn’t tell anyone was going to do it, I just did it,’’ said Lane, who remained seated through a performance by saxophone player Mike Phillips. Lane, who signed a four-year, 23 million contract in the offseason to stay with the Seahawks, said he is prepared for whatever backlash comes his way. While a valuable part of Seattle’s secondary, he has started just six games and is hardly as well-known as many of his teammates. Most may know Lane for suffering devastating wrist and knee injuries on the same play in the Super Bowl XLIX loss to New England. He knows a different sort of attention may come his way now. “I don’t mean no disrespect to anybody,’’ he said. “I’m just standing behind what I believe in.’’ Lane said he intends to continue to sit during the anthem “until I feel like justice is being served.’’ Carroll called Lane’s action “an individual thing,’’ and said he could not answer what he thinks of whether Lane will continue to sit during the anthem — Seattle’s next game is at CenturyLink Field on Sept. 11 against Miami — because he has not been told that’s what Lane plans to do. “That was an individual thing,’’ Carroll said. “But I am really proud of the progress we are making in the conversation and I look forward to continuing it with our guys. It’s really important for us to understand and to be smart about what we are doing and how we handle our business. And we have, like I have been telling you, we have a great group of guys that lead this team and they are going to help us as we move forward.’’ After the anthem, teammate Richard Sherman sat down and chatted with Lane briefly. While Lane said they did not talk about the anthem, Sherman said he wanted to show support for Lane. “Yeah I mean everybody is entitled to their opinion,’’ Sherman said. “That’s our country — you are free to say what you want and express yourself in a way that you feel is in line with what you believe, and that’s what he did. He sat down, he wanted to make a point, and I think it was a great point.’’ No other players on either side sat during the anthem. In response to Kaepernick’s action last week, the NFL released a statement saying, “players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the national anthem.” Sherman said this week that while he thought Kaepernick was making a good point in attempting to draw attention to the issues of discrimination and police brutality against people of color, he “could have picked a better platform.” Asked then what he would tell any teammate who might be tempted to sit during the anthem, Sherman said: “Just tell him to think about the pros and the cons. Every action has an equal or greater reaction. And there’s going to be criticism. There’s going to be backlash. There’s going to be people behind screens that will judge you, that will criticize you, that will say whatever they want about you, and you’ve got to be willing to deal with that.” At almost the same time Lane was sitting in Oakland, Kaepernick and teammate Eric Reid were kneeling during the anthem in San Diego. As detailed by The Associated Press, Kaepernick was accompanied by former Seahawks long snapper Nate Boyer, also a former Green Beret, who was with Seattle during training camp last season. The AP reported that Boyer, who wrote a conciliatory open letter to Kaepernick earlier this week, had a long conversation with the quarterback about his stance this week. He posted a photo of the two on Twitter with a caption reading: “Let’s just keep moving forward. This is what America should be all about.” Maybe hard to tell but that's Jeremy Lane sitting during anthem. pic.twitter.com/OHtO2D8T0T — Bob Condotta (@bcondotta) September 2, 2016 ||||| San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the singing of the national anthem before Thursday's preseason game in San Diego. He wasn't alone in his protest. Safety Eric Reid knelt beside Kaepernick. In Oakland, meanwhile, Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane sat on the bench during the playing of the anthem, according to the Associated Press. Kaepernick told NFL Network's Steve Wyche on Saturday that he was sitting during the anthem in protest of societal wrongdoings against African-Americans and minorities in the United States. The Chargers crowd loudly booed the 49ers when they came out on to the field, and once again every time Kaepernick took a snap under center. Kaepernick impressively directed a 15-play touchdown drive on the opening offensive series of the game. Kaepernick only ran two more series in a quick-moving first half, leading the team to a field goal before halftime. He completed 11 of 18 passes for 103 yards in the 49ers' win, making a strong push to keep his roster spot as the team's backup. While the former Super Bowl starter's status on this Chip Kelly team is fascinating in its own right, his protest during the national anthem will continue to drive national news. He spoke with remarkable clarity during the team's postgame news conference, ready to answer any question sent his way. Kaepernick spoke of the support he received all week and believed that the protest brought the team together rather than being a distraction. Kaepernick said he had \\"many conversations\\" with Reid about his protest and that his teammate ultimately joined him to show his support. \\"He approached me and said, 'I support what you're doing,\\" Kaepernick said. \\"I support what your message is. Let's think about how we can do this together.' \\"We wanted to make sure that the message we're trying to say isn't lost with the action that's coming along with it.\\" Reid said after the game he wanted to let Kaepernick \\"know that he's not the only person who feels the way he feels.\\" Lane expressed that same sentiment to reporters, saying he wanted to show support for Kaepernick and that he didn't tell anyone on the Seahawks before the game that he would sit out the anthem. \\"I think I plan (to) keep on doing it,\\" Lane said, \\"until I feel like justice has been served.\\" Kaepernick, who said he's donating 1 million to organizations he supports, said he was \\"very happy and very proud\\" of Lane for his decision to sit. Kaepernick also clarified what he's trying to accomplish with his protest. \\"The message is that we have a lot of issues in this country that we need to deal with,\\" he said. \\"We have a lot of people that are oppressed, we have a lot of people that aren't treated equally ... there are a lot of issues that need to be talked about, need to be brought to life, and we need to fix those things.\\" Nate Boyer, a 35-year-old who competed for a job on the Seattle Seahawks last offseason as a long snapper, stood beside Kaepernick during the anthem. Boyer wrote an open letter to Kaepernick on Wednesday expressing his viewpoints, and he told NFL Network's Alex Flanagan on Thursday that they each spoke at length before the game. Kaepernick indicated that Boyer helped him come up with the plan to take a knee before the game rather than sit on the bench out of respect to the military. Kaepernick stood and clapped after the playing of \\"God Bless America\\" in the second half of the game. \\"I love America,\\" Kaepernick said. The 49ers have supported Kaepernick's right to protest the anthem. The question entering this weekend of roster cuts: Will he still be on the 49ers' roster when the anthem plays before their season opener? ||||| San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, middle, kneels during the national anthem before the team's NFL preseason football game against the San Diego Chargers, Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016, in San... (Associated Press) SAN DIEGO (AP) — While a naval officer sang the first notes of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" and dozens of military members unfurled an oversized flag on the football field, Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid dropped to one knee on the San Francisco 49ers' sideline. With his silent gestures of protest, Kaepernick intends to keep drawing attention to a litany of American problems — and he's no longer alone. Kaepernick and Reid kneeled during the national anthem Thursday before the 49ers' 31-21 preseason victory over San Diego, ignoring scattered boos and angry shouts in Qualcomm Stadium at the Chargers' Salute to the Military preseason game. Up north in Oakland, Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane showed his support for Kaepernick by sitting on the bench during the anthem. \\"I'm not anti-American. I love America,\\" said Kaepernick, who stayed on the field long after the game to sign autographs for enthusiastic fans. \\"I love people. That's why I'm doing this. I want to help make America better, and I think having these conversations helps everybody have a better understanding of where everybody is coming from.\\" Kaepernick's protest has dominated the public discussion of the nation's most popular sport this week, and his stance has been met with passionate condemnation and support. His refusal to stand for the anthem first came to public notice last week when he remained seated on the 49ers' bench before a preseason game against Green Bay. The quarterback cited numerous reasons for his actions, ranging from racial injustice and minority oppression to police brutality and the treatment of military veterans. Kaepernick said he plans to continue his protests during the regular season. He also intends to donate 1 million \\"to different organizations to help these communities and help these people,\\" declining to provide specifics. \\"The message is that we have a lot of issues in this country that we need to deal with,\\" Kaepernick said. \\"We have a lot of people that are oppressed. We have a lot of people that aren't treated equally, that aren't given equal opportunities. Police brutality is a huge thing that needs to be addressed. There are a lot of issues that need to be talked about.\\" Kaepernick wasn't earnestly booed in San Diego until he took the field to start the game for the 49ers, immediately leading them on a 16-play, 85-yard touchdown drive against the hometown team. Amid his burgeoning social activism, he is also fighting for a roster spot and attempting to regain the starting job that he lost last season. When Kaepernick left the field following pregame warmups, he was greeted with profanity and obscene gestures from Leo Uzcategui, a 20-year Navy veteran in a military-green Chargers jersey with quarterback Philip Rivers' No. 17 in camouflage numbering. \\"I was in the Navy and I saw men and women bleed and die for this flag,\\" Uzcategui said. \\"If he wants to do something, go to some outreach program where he can do some good. And I get it, his First Amendment right. But you don't sit during the presenting of the colors, and you don't sit during the national anthem. That is not the way to do it.\\" A sign in the crowd read: \\"You're an American. Act like one.\\" But Domenique Banks, a 23-year-old fan from nearby Oceanside, California, got the quarterback to sign his Kaepernick jersey before the game. \\"I told him I appreciate what he is standing up for,\\" Banks said. \\"He said he appreciated it. Most of the people I talk to say the same thing. I don't like that he is sitting during the national anthem, but I appreciate what he is standing for.\\" Kaepernick was thrilled to be joined by Reid, the 49ers' starting safety and a fourth-year veteran from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Reid and Kaepernick decided together on kneeling rather than sitting during the anthem. \\"I just wanted to show my support for him,\\" Reid said. \\"He wanted to make it clear that he wasn't trying to be disrespectful to the military or the national anthem, so he decided to change his position to be more respectful, but still bring awareness to the issues that he believes are going on in this country, and that I wholeheartedly believe exist in this country.\\" In Oakland, Lane sat on the bench behind his standing teammates before Seattle's game against the Raiders. Lane said he doesn't know Kaepernick, but was \\"standing behind him.\\" \\"It's something I plan to keep on doing until I feel like justice has been served,\\" Lane said. \\"No, I didn't tell anyone I was going to do it. I just did it. ... I don't mean no disrespect toward anybody, but I'm just standing behind what I believe.\\" Kaepernick kneeled next to Nate Boyer, a former Green Beret who went to training camp with the Seahawks last year as a long snapper. Boyer, who wrote a conciliatory open letter to Kaepernick earlier this week, spoke with the quarterback about his stance this week. He posted a photo of the two on Twitter with a caption reading, \\"Let's just keep moving forward. This is what America should be all about.\\" When the same naval officer performed \\"God Bless America\\" before the fourth quarter, Kaepernick remained standing and then applauded along with his teammates. Kaepernick doesn't intend his stance to be a criticism of the military. When the Chargers' public-address announcer asked fans to recognize active military personnel during a timeout, the quarterback stood and enthusiastically applauded along with his teammates and the entire stadium. \\"I realize that men and women of the military go out and sacrifice their lives and put themselves in harm's way for my freedom of speech, and my freedoms in this country, and my freedom to take a seat or take a knee,\\" Kaepernick said. \\"So I have the utmost respect for them, and I think what I did was taken out of context and spun a different way.\\" Kaepernick's social activism, which only emerged publicly in recent weeks, also included support for the Black Lives Matter movement through social media. While negative reaction to the quarterback has been strong, Kaepernick also has been widely praised for his commitment to his stance. Veterans and military members tweeted their support for Kaepernick in recent days under the hashtag \\"VeteransForKaepernick.\\" \\"It was something I was thinking about to make sure that I'm not just talking about something, but I'm actively being involved and actively trying to make a change in these communities,\\" Kaepernick said. \\"I've been very blessed to be in this position and be able to make the kind of money I do, and I have to help these people.\\" ___ AP Sports Writer Josh Dubow in Oakland contributed to this story. ___ Online: AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL ||||| 49ers’ Kaepernick joined by Reid in not standing for national anthem SAN DIEGO - Colin Kaepernick was joined by safety Eric Reid in not standing for the national anthem before the 49ers’ preseason finale tonight at Qualcomm Stadium. Reid, who was not in uniform, appeared to kneel next to Kaepernick just before Petty Officer 1st Class Steve Powell from the U.S. Navy sang the anthem on the Chargers’ 28th annual “Salute to the Military Night.” After the anthem was over, Kaepernick and Reid stood up and exchanged a hug. It’s not known if Reid joined Kaepernick in not standing during the 49ers’ first three preseason games. On Wednesday, on Twitter, Reid posted an article Dr. Harry Edwards wrote in The Chronicle supporting Kaepernick. “Very well said Dr. Edwards,” Reid wrote. Reid also engaged in Twitter conversations, at point writing: “There is a difference btwn dividing & speaking on/pointing out issues. Kaep is doing the (latter) in an effort to unite.” Reid also wrote: “black Americans are 2.5 times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by police officers.” Reid 24, a 2013 first-round pick, is also the 49ers’ NFLPA representative. As Kaepernick knelt during the anthem, former Green Beret Nate Boyer stood to his left with his right hand over his heart. This week, Kaepernick reached out to Boyer, who earned a Bronze Star in Iraq. Boyer, 35, a Dublin native, was a long snapper at Texas who attended the 49ers local pro day last year before spending training camp with the Seahawks. Kaepernick invited Boyer to Thursday’s game after Boyer penned a thoughtful open letter to Kaepernick on ArmyTimes.com. Boyer said he struck a conciliatory tone after his mother told him “the last thing our country needed right now was more hate.” Kaepernick and Boyer met for 90 minutes on Thursday in San Diego, Fox Sports reported. Before the game, Boyer posted a picture of them together on Twitter with the message: “Thanks for the invite brother ... Good talk. Let's just keep moving forward. This is what America should be all about.” After the anthem ended tonight, the crowd broke into a chant of “USA.” Kaepernick, who was booed as ran on the field for the game-opening drive, proceeded to lead a 16-play, 85-yard touchdown drive. He completed 6 of 8 passes for 58 yards. He also had two runs for 30 yards.

Step 1: Identifying the key words and their meanings - \\"Je\\" means \\"is\\" or \\"it's\\" - \\"přece\\" can be translated to \\"after all\\" or \\"yet\\" as it adds emphasis to the sentence - \\"svatého\\" is the genitive form of \\"svatý,\\" meaning \\"holy\\" or \\"saint\\" - \\"Valentýna\\" refers to \\"Valentine\\" Step 2: Rearranging the words into an English sentence structure - In English, the order of words in a sentence generally follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) format. - In this case, \\"It's\\" will be the subject and the verb, and \\"svatého Valentýna\\" will be the object. - Since \\"přece\\" adds emphasis, we can place it right after the subject-verb combination, resulting in \\"It's after all/yet svatého Valentýna.\\" Step 3: Finishing the translation - Replace \\"svatého Valentýna\\" with its direct translation, \\"Saint Valentine,\\" to create the final sentence.

Mostly when people say that they never dream, what they really mean is that they don't remember their dreams or they don't think their dreams are important. The reason behind is that they might have been made fun of with a child when they first reported their dreams or it was so frightening that they just turned off dreaming completely. The other day, someone named Davis came to me and said that he used to be a great dreamer, but suddenly he stopped having dreams. I asked him what it happened. It turned out that his brother died by heart attack and he never expected that such a terrible thing would happen to a young person. Generally, when there was some frightening event and dream about it was too terrible. People prefer not to dream about it. Actually the worst thing you can do is stop dreaming. Because it means that the bad experience would be too painful to even appear in dreams. As long as you dream about it and even the dream is frightening, your mind is working on it. My personal opinion about what dreams do is that they help us deal with our problems. We see certain patterns take place in dreams. When a person is hurt deep inside, when a person is seriously ill or when a person has been really sad, if people turn off their dreams totally, it means they don't love themselves to even think about it.

While it is positive, it is also crucial to consider its depth, specific aspects discussed, and the context of the product or service being reviewed. 1. Depth: The review is minimalistic, consisting of only one word. This does not offer substantial insight or explanation from the reviewer's experience. It suggests that they liked the product or service but provides no further information. Due to its brevity, it lacks the depth to adequately inform other potential customers or help the business identify areas for improvement. 2. Specific Aspects: The review does not mention any specific attributes or features of the product or service. A valuable review should ideally address significant aspects such as quality, value for money, efficiency, or customer support. As such, this curt review offers little tangible feedback. 3. Context: Without additional context or information about the product or service, it is challenging to interpret the review's relevance. This review might refer to anything from a restaurant meal to a software application or a piece of clothing. Consequently, the usefulness of the feedback is severely diminished for both potential customers and the business. Considering the above factors, I would rate this review a 2 out of 5. While it does communicate a positive sentiment, the lack of depth, specific aspects discussed, and context reduces its overall value as a helpful and informative review.

However, in August 2012, the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) stripped him of all these titles and banned him from professional cycling for life due to overwhelming evidence of his involvement in a systematic doping program. Lance Armstrong, an American professional cyclist, is a well-known figure in the world of sports. His initial victories were regarded as a symbol of hope and inspiration for many, as he battled and overcame testicular cancer before achieving these significant wins. However, doubts and allegations had been surrounding Armstrong for years prior to the investigation and decision by the USADA. The investigation brought forth numerous testimonies from former teammates, supporting staff, and witnesses, which revealed that Armstrong had used a range of performance-enhancing drugs and methods, including EPO, testosterone, corticosteroids, human growth hormone, and blood transfusions. The evidence against Armstrong was extensive and irrefutable. In October 2012, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the governing body of professional cycling, ratified the USADA's decision and officially removed Armstrong's seven Tour de France titles. In response to the evidence and sanctions, Armstrong remained adamant that he had never doped. However, in January 2013, Armstrong finally confessed to doping during all of his Tour de France victories in a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey. The public reaction to Armstrong's confession was mainly disappointment and disgust, and his reputation and legacy were irreparably damaged. As a result, Armstrong's name has been removed from the official record books, and his seven consecutive Tour de France \\"wins\\" from 1999 to 2005 have been invalidated.

Movie plot title: Magic Movie plot: Charles \\"Corky\\" Withers has just failed in his first attempt at professional magic. His mentor \\"Merlin\\" (E.J.AndrÃ©) says that he needs to have a better show business gimmick. A year later, Corky comes back as a combination magician and ventriloquist with a foul-mouthed dummy named Fats and is a huge success. His powerful agent Ben Greene is on the verge of signing Corky for his own television show, but Corky bails out for the Catskills, where he grew up, claiming to be \\"afraid of success.\\" In truth, he does not want to take the TV network's required medical examination because doctors might find out that he suffers from severe issues, and that even off-stage he cannot control Fats (a manifestation of Corky's id). In the Catskills, he reunites with his high-school crush, Peggy Ann Snow, who is stuck in a passionless marriage with Corky's friend from high school, Duke. A magic trick with a deck of cards charms Peg into thinking they are soulmates. She and Corky make love, which sparks the jealousy not only of Peggy's tough-guy husband but also the dummy Fats. Greene arrives unexpectedly, having tracked Corky down. After a tense confrontation, in which Greene discovers the truth about Corky's mental state, the agent demands that Corky get help. Fats, however, convinces Corky to kill Greene. Corky does this by using Fats' hard, wooden head. He then removes all of Greene's identification and drags the corpse to the lake. When Corky tries to dispose of the body, however, Greene suddenly lunges at him, still alive. Corky, after an intense fight, manages to drown him. The next morning, Fats becomes even more possessive and jealous when Corky says that he plans to leave Fats behind so that he and Peggy can honeymoon by themselves. Duke returns from his trip earlier than expected. He suspects his wife cheated on him and wants to have a talk with Corky on the lake. Rather than confront him, Duke awkwardly confides to Corky that he loves Peggy and is worried about losing her. Duke suddenly spots a dead body on the edge...

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: At what lake in the area that has been covered by sea water at least seven times do nutrients quickly deteriorate? , can you please find it? A vast marshland could only have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25 million and 2 million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present. Shorter hydroperiods of three or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other microscopic organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod. Five types of peat appear in the Everglades system; each type supports a specific type of vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or custard apple trees. Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called subsidence. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil. The dried peat burned or was degraded into carbon dioxide and water by microorganisms. Some homes built near early farms had to restructure their foundations on stilts as...

Consequently, we can regard \\"many days\\" to be synonymous with \\"a long time\\" in this particular case. Therefore, the statement \\"It has taken me many days to find you two\\" can be reasonably paraphrased as \\"It has taken a long time to find you two.\\" Of course, the exact duration that constitutes \\"many days\\" might be subjective, as it depends on individual perspective and context.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that Chrisye refused access to? ? Chrisye's tenor voice and performance on Badai Pasti Berlalu led Amin Widjaja of Musica Studios to ask him to sign with Musica; Widjaja had been scouting him since the release of Guruh Gipsy. Chrisye agreed on condition that he be allowed creative freedom, to which Widjaja reluctantly agreed. In May 1978 Chrisye began work on his first album with Musica, Sabda Alam (Nature's Order), incorporating several songs by other artists and some written by himself, including the title song. He recorded it after locking himself in the studio with the sound engineer and arranger; despite Amin's wanting to monitor their progress, Chrisye refused to allow him access. The album, greatly influenced by Badai Pasti Berlalu and drawing on the double tracking technique pioneered by the Beatles (in which the vocals are recorded twice to achieve fuller sound), was released in August that year. Heavily promoted in a campaign during which Chrisye was interviewed on the national television station TVRI and on radio, the album eventually sold 400,000 copies.The following year Chrisye recorded Percik Pesona (Stain of Enchantment) with Jockie. Produced after Amin's death, the album featured songs written by Chrisye's close friend Junaidi Salat, as well as Jockie and Guruh. The album's title was chosen by vote; the titular song was not released as a single. Percik Pesona, released in August 1979, was a critical and commercial failure. After discussing the issue with other artists, Chrisye blamed the album's failure on its similarity to Badai Pasti Berlalu. As a result, following a period of contemplation, he began branching out into different genres. That same year he was on the panel of the Prambors Teenage Songwriting Competition, held on 5 May.After deciding that romantic pop songs influenced by easy listening would suit him best, Chrisye began recording his next album, Puspa Indah (Beautiful Flower).

Roughing Vane over, Reilly discovers he has taken a missing person's case in which an insurance company is trying to locate someone named Alex Pleshette. However, when Reilly presents himself to the insurance office to drop the case, the owner Max Arnett claims he never hired his agency to begin with. On the way out however, Arnett's receptionist inadvertently gives away the truth that Reilly was in fact hired. Heading back to his office, Reilly is confronted by two thugs in an alley who beat him and tell him to lay off the Pleshette case. In his office a short time later, a beautiful young woman in black arrives. Presenting herself as Mrs. Pleshette, Reilly assumes she is Alex Pleshette's wife, however she curtly informs him that her husband is dead, and that she is actually Alexandra, better known as Alex Pleshette. She tells him to stop interfering as she is now no longer missing, and departs â leaving him even more confused. Next day, Reilly finds out from his police detective friend Jack Bosley that Alex Pleshette witnessed the murder of her husband, a wealthy tycoon named Donald Pleshette who was at the time being investigated for company insurance fraud. However, she was knocked unconscious by the killer and as a result is unable to remember the event. Not long after this, she went missing and no one knew where she was, not even her lover Gabe Preston, her husband's disgruntled business partner. Reilly recognizes that Preston would thus have a motive for murder, but Bosley explains that he has a strong alibi. Later, Reilly gives Vane a camera and instructs him to follow Arnett and take photos of anything that appears interesting. Meanwhile, he drives to the Pleshette mansion on Noir Drive to confront Alex.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Perhaps your spouse doesn’t want to move because they don’t want to be steamrolled in the decision-making process. You can combat this by including them in all of the planning. Not only can involvement help them feel like they have a say in the situation, but it may also make them more excited about moving. Allow your spouse to look at homes with you, scout out neighborhoods, and choose design options. They may find that moving presents them with better choices when they are able to see what the home and area are like. If you want to move to a new city, state, or even country, plan a vacation there. Being immersed in the area may help your spouse to change their mind when they see what the new environment has to offer. Choose activities that will highlight the location and find things to do that your spouse likes. Planning your trip out ahead of time to include what your spouse will enjoy could make all of the difference in the world. If you are able to, rent an apartment in the new location for a few months. This allows your spouse to really get an idea of what it would be like to move there. You may find that they like the new area because of this, or you may even discover that after living there, you would rather not move at all. If you still can’t come to an agreement, at least try to come to a compromise. Suggest renting your house out for a year, and moving to your ideal spot until the lease is up. If your spouse still isn’t happy, make an offer to move back into your home. However, if your spouse is willing to try out a move for you, you must be good on your word and move back if they don’t love the new location. To make the agreement even more official, put together a contract of sorts. Include that you agree to live in the new home for a year and you will move back to the original home if you aren’t both happy with the new place. Having a document such as this may make your spouse feel more confident that you will, in fact, move if they don’t want to stay after a year.

Question: Who are the German Jews here? Movie plot title: Cabaret Movie plot: In 1931 Berlin, young American Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) performs at the Kit Kat Klub. A new British arrival in the city, Brian Roberts (Michael York), moves into the boarding house where Sally lives. A reserved academic and writer, Brian gives English lessons to earn a living while completing his doctorate. Sally tries seducing Brian and suspects he may be gay. Brian tells Sally that on three previous occasions he has tried to have physical relationships with women, all of which failed. They become friends, and Brian witnesses Sally's anarchic, bohemian life in the last days of the German Weimar Republic. Sally and Brian become lovers despite their earlier reservations; they conclude that his previous failures with women were because they were \\"the wrong three girls\\". Sally befriends Maximilian von Heune, a rich playboy baron who takes her and Brian to his country estate; it becomes ambiguous which of the duo Max is seducing. After a sexual experience with Brian, Max loses interest in the two and departs for Argentina. During an argument, when Sally tells Brian that she has been having sex with Max, Brian reveals that he has as well. Brian and Sally later reconcile, and Sally reveals that Max left them money and mockingly compares the sum with what a professional prostitute gets. Sally learns that she is pregnant, but is unsure of the father. Brian offers to marry her and take her back to his university life in Cambridge. At first they celebrate their resolution to start this new life together, but after a picnic between Sally and Brian in which Brian acts distant and uninterested, Sally starts to doubt continuing with the pregnancy, and is disheartened by the vision of herself as a bored faculty wife washing dirty diapers. Ultimately she has an abortion, without informing Brian in advance. When he confronts her, she shares her fears and the two reach an understanding. Brian departs for England and Sally continues her life in Berlin, embedding herself in the Kit Kat Club, but the final shot shows men in...

The movie is set in 1931 Berlin, during the last days of the German Weimar Republic, which was a period of significant cultural and political change in Germany. The rise of the Nazi party and their anti-Semitic beliefs would have certainly affected the lives of German Jews at the time. However, the plot summary provided does not directly identify any of the characters as German Jews. The main focus of the story revolves around Sally Bowles, Brian Roberts, and their interactions with other characters, including the playboy baron Maximilian von Heune.

Which common kitchen herb is used in a Mojito?","completion":"In a Mojito, the common kitchen herb that is typically used is fresh mint leaves (Mentha species). Originating in Cuba, Mojito is a popular rum-based cocktail that enjoys widespread popularity around the world. The classic Mojito recipe combines five essential ingredients - white rum, sugar, lime juice, soda water, and, of course, mint. The mint leaves impart a refreshing aroma and flavor to the cocktail, making it an ideal thirst-quencher on hot summer days. There is an art to using mint in a Mojito. To properly incorporate the mint, bartenders often use a technique called muddling. Gently bruising the mint leaves with a muddler helps release the herb's natural oils and flavors, infusing the cocktail with its refreshing taste. However, it's essential not to over-muddle the mint, as that could result in a bitter or vegetative taste instead of the desired fresh, herbal flavor. It's worth noting that there are over 600 varieties of mint plants, but the most common types used in Mojitos are Spearmint (Mentha spicata) and Peppermint (Mentha × piperita). While both work well for making this classic Cuban cocktail, Spearmint is usually the preferred choice due to its milder and sweeter taste, whereas Peppermint has a strong and slightly more pungent flavor. In addition to its use in Mojitos, mint has a myriad of culinary and health applications. It is a versatile herb that pairs well with a variety of sweet and savory dishes, often used in salads, marinades, dips, and teas. Mint is not just limited to food and drinks; it also has medicinal properties. It has been used for centuries to alleviate digestive discomfort, soothe headaches, and freshen breath. To fully harness the benefits and flavors of mint, it is best to use fresh leaves rather than dried ones. In conclusion, mint is the common kitchen herb primarily used in Mojitos, giving the cocktail its signature refreshing taste. The technique of muddling the mint helps in releasing the herb's flavorful oils, making the classic rum-based beverage an enjoyable drinking experience. Remember to use fresh mint leaves, preferably Spearmint, and muddle them gently to get the best results for a perfect Mojito."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Between 1959 and 1979 the gains were 3 points per decade. Between 1979 and 1989 the increase approached 2 IQ points. Between 1989 and 1998 the gain was about 1.3 points. Between 1998 and 2004 IQ declined by about the same amount as it gained between 1989 and 1998. They speculate that \\"a contributing factor in this recent fall could be a simultaneous decline in proportions of students entering 3-year advanced-level school programs for 16-18-year-olds.\\" The same authors in a more comprehensive 2008 study, again on Danish male conscripts, found that there was a 1.5-point increase between 1988 and 1998, but a 1.5-point decrease between 1998 and 2003/2004. A possible contributing factor to the more recent decline may be changes in the Danish educational system.

Database: The first task of a database designer is to produce a conceptual data model that reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database. A common approach to this is to develop an entity-relationship model, often with the aid of drawing tools. Another popular approach is the Unified Modeling Language. A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled: for example, if people can have more than one phone number, it will allow this information to be captured. Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organisation, like \\"can a customer also be a supplier?\\", or \\"if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?\\", or \\"if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?\\". The answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities (customers, products, flights, flight segments) and their relationships and attributes. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". What does a conceptual data model never do?","completion":"A conceptual data model never imposes how the data is to be stored, managed, processed or retrieved at the system or physical level. It is a high-level model that provides an overview of the informational requirements of an organization, rather than focusing on the technical aspects such as data storage and operations, or specifying how the data will be physically stored in a database. This model solely focuses on discovering and defining the relationships, entities, and rules within the data. The specifics of how the data is to be implemented, stored, or used are handled in the later stages of database design, during the creation of the physical data model. The conceptual data model is much more about trying to understand and map out the abstract domain of the problem space than attempting to determine specific technical implementations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

La opción de alquiler es un acuerdo que permite al comprador alquilar una propiedad por un período determinado, con la posibilidad de comprarla al final del plazo. Este tipo de acuerdo es común en el sector inmobiliario y puede ser beneficioso tanto para el comprador como para el vendedor. El comprador, en este caso, acuerda alquilar la propiedad al vendedor durante el plazo establecido en el contrato de opción de alquiler. Esto significa que el comprador utilizará la propiedad como si fuera suya, pero aún no será el propietario legal. En cambio, el vendedor mantendrá la titularidad de la propiedad hasta que el comprador decida ejercer su opción de compra. El precio de alquiler predeterminado es una cantidad fija que el comprador pagará al vendedor por el uso de la propiedad durante el plazo de alquiler. Este monto se acuerda entre ambas partes al comienzo del contrato y generalmente no cambia durante el plazo de la opción de alquiler. El precio del alquiler puede ser una consideración importante para el comprador ya que puede afectar la cantidad de dinero que podrán ahorrar para la futura compra de la propiedad. El acuerdo de opción de alquiler también puede incluir términos y condiciones adicionales para ambas partes, como el mantenimiento y la responsabilidad de las reparaciones en la propiedad, los términos de renovación del contrato y las condiciones para ejercer la opción de compra.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which army did the defected Song troops join, the Han Army or the Newly Submitted Army?","completion":"Title: The Fate of Defected Song Troops: The Han Army or the Newly Submitted Army? Introduction The Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) in China was marked by its culturally rich and economically prosperous era, known for impressive advancements in arts, science, and technology. However, like any other dynasty, political and military intrigues kept the Song court busy in maintaining its rule. One of the most important and recurring events throughout the Song Dynasty was the defection of Song troops. In this article, we will examine the historical context and reason behind the defection of Song troops and identify which army these defectors eventually joined – the Han Army or the Newly Submitted Army. Historical Context The Song Dynasty faced numerous invasions by external forces, such as the Jurchens, the Khitans, and the Mongols. As a result, various military campaigns were launched throughout the dynasty's history. During these campaigns, some Song troops, for a variety of reasons, decided to defect from their original military units. The two main armies that these defectors joined were the Han Army and the Newly Submitted Army. To fully understand the implications of their defection, we must dive deeper into the composition and roles of these two armies. The Han Army The Han Army consisted of soldiers and military units who were primarily made up of ethnic Han Chinese. The Han Army was an integral part of the Song Dynasty's military forces. Initially, the Han Army had occupied important positions in the dynasty's defense system. However, as tensions grew between the Song Dynasty and neighboring enemies, the Han Army soon faced difficulties maintaining its strength and numbers. Consequently, the question was raised about whether to integrate defected Song troops, bolstering the ranks of the Han Army. The Newly Submitted Army In stark contrast to the Han Army, the Newly Submitted Army was composed of defectors from different ethnic groups and rival states. The Song Dynasty used the Newly Submitted Army as a distinct military force, separate from the Han Army. The rationale behind the creation of the Newly Submitted Army was to utilize the military capabilities of these former enemies to subdue any further external threats. The Song court did this by offering incentives like rank, titles, and land to the defectors and their families to help facilitate inclusion and loyalty to the Song Dynasty. Which Army Did The Defected Song Troops Join? The defectors' eventual allegiance was heavily influenced by political and military strategies employed by the Song Dynasty. The Song court carefully deliberated over the best course of action with regards to the defectors, taking into account their capabilities and loyalties. On several occasions, defected Song troops were integrated into the Han Army. This was done to reinforce the ranks of the Han Army when needed, as well as using these troops to strengthen the ethnic Han presence in the military force. However, the Song Dynasty was also keen on exploiting the potential benefits of incorporating the defected Song troops into the Newly Submitted Army. This was an effort to capitalize on the knowledge and skills of these soldiers, who were believed to possess valuable insights into enemy strategies and fighting techniques. Consequently, defected Song troops were also integrated into the Newly Submitted Army in the hopes of leveraging their abilities in future battles against rival forces. Conclusion In summary, defected Song troops had the potential to join either the Han Army or the Newly Submitted Army, depending on the particular needs and strategies of the Song Dynasty. While both armies had their unique roles in the Song military, the defected troops provided an opportunity to reinforce their strengths and address any weaknesses. Through a complex geopolitical landscape and a series of key political decisions, these soldiers were integrated into the chosen army, contributing to the ever-evolving military dynamics that shaped the Song Dynasty's tumultuous history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a question about this article: Karl Popper was born in Vienna (then in Austria-Hungary) in 1902, to upper middle-class parents. All of Karl Popper's grandparents were Jewish, but the Popper family converted to Lutheranism before Karl was born, and so he received Lutheran baptism. They understood this as part of their cultural assimilation, not as an expression of devout belief. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University, and mother Jenny Schiff was of Silesian and Hungarian descent. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a partner in the law firm of Vienna's liberal Burgomaster Herr Grübl and, after Grübl's death in 1898, Simon took over the business. (Malachi Hacohen records that Herr Grübl's first name was Raimund, after which Karl received his middle name. Popper himself, in his autobiography, erroneously recalls that Herr Grübl's first name was Carl.) His father was a bibliophile who had 12,000–14,000 volumes in his personal library. Popper inherited both the library and the disposition from him.

On June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. \\"For a year now\\", Corgan wrote, \\"I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams\\". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.In April 2007 Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \\"didn't want to be a part of\\" the reunion. The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton. That same month, \\"Tarantula\\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \\"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that\\".

He longs for more, feeling trapped and uninspired by his mundane life and the limitations of his village. Every night, he dreams of an ancient desert city, filled with beautiful landscapes and long-lost treasures hidden within the sandy dunes. One day, his friend, an archaeologist named Sonia, approaches Ajileo with an old, mysterious map she discovered in an excavation site. The map's intricate details seem to depict the very city that Ajileo has been dreaming of for so long. Unable to ignore the surreal coincidence, Ajileo and Sonia embark on a perilous journey across the desert, armed with nothing but their hope, their resilience, and a thirst for discovery. As they travel through the unforgiving desert, they encounter desert-dwelling nomads, mystical creatures, and dangerous traps left by treasure hunters who came before them. The journey brings Ajileo and Sonia closer together as they grapple with their insecurities, fears, and past traumas. Getting to the city is an initiation in itself, each life-threatening challenge providing them with personal growth, pushing them to the edge of their capabilities. They finally arrive at the fabled city, only to find it abandoned and in ruins, a shadow of its grandeur witnessed in Ajileo’s dreams.

Their friendship becomes their treasure, and Ajileo's journey remains immortalized in his art.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan.

Question: suppose the sky is filled with darkness happens, how will it affect there will be no sunlight. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"A sky filled with darkness would have a significant impact on the greenhouse process, particularly on the second effect mentioned, which is the plants and floor absorbing sunlight. If there is no sunlight due to the sky being filled with darkness, the effectiveness of this process would be greatly reduced. To understand how the absence of sunlight can affect the temperature inside a greenhouse, we must first understand how solar radiation heats up the glass enclosure. Ordinarily, sunlight passes through the glass and gets absorbed by the plants and floor inside the greenhouse. This absorbed energy is then converted to heat, warming the plants, air, and soil. When this heat energy encounters the glass walls and roof, it cannot escape easily due to the insulating properties of the glass, thereby trapping the heat inside and causing the temperature to rise. This warming process facilitates a more favorable environment for plant growth. However, should the sky be filled with darkness and devoid of sunlight, the greenhouse effect would be disrupted in the following ways: 1. Reduced energy absorption: With no sunlight penetrating the glass, plants and the floor would be unable to absorb any solar radiation. Consequently, no heat would be produced, rendering the greenhouse incapable of raising the temperature inside. 2. Impaired photosynthesis: In the absence of sunlight, plants may suffer due to the lack of photosynthesis, which is the process through which plants harness sunlight to produce food. This would greatly diminish their growth and productivity. 3. Altered air circulation: Since the warm air would not rise without sunlight-induced heat, the usual pattern of air circulation that occurs as a result of temperature differences would be disrupted. Consequently, the colder air on top would not be forced down and warmed as efficiently. In conclusion, the absence of sunlight would have a major effect on the plants' and floor's ability to absorb solar radiation in a greenhouse. Both the plant growth and internal temperature regulation mechanisms would be significantly impaired due to a lack of sunlight. The overall process would be operating at a diminished effectiveness, resulting in a less favorable environment for plant growth."},{"prompt":"Build a movie plot around this: Bill goes to see whom?

One night, Bill dreams of a mysterious man named Max who reveals that he is holding the secret to a fulfilled life. Entranced by the enigmatic dream, he starts seeing signs of Max in his daily life - receiving emails, letters, and hearing stories from various townsfolk about a man who goes by the name Max. Convinced that finding Max will lead to his purpose, Bill decides to embark on a quest to finally meet this enigmatic man. The film unfolds, showing Bill going on a cross-country journey to find Max. He has his fair share of setbacks and challenges - sleeping in his car, running out of money, and overcoming emotional and mental barriers. However, along the way, Bill meets a colorful cast of characters, including a struggling musician named Emily. Emily, who is also searching for fulfillment, becomes Bill's travelling companion on his journey to find Max. As the duo navigates the ups and downs of their adventure, they realize that the search for Max is helping them discover their purpose in life and what brings them true happiness. Eventually, they reach the last possible destination, only to find out that Max does not actually exist, at least not as a person. Instead, \\"Max\\" represents the idea of breaking free from the mundane, finding one's true passion, and embracing the journey of self-discovery.

In the end, Bill decides to leave his accounting job and starts his own small business that combines his passion for numbers with his newfound love for adventure. Emily, inspired by her journey with Bill, pursues her dream of becoming a successful musician.

What's the other name for the statue of Egyptian god Harmachis?","completion":"The other name for the statue of the Egyptian god Harmachis is the \\"Sphinx of Giza\\" or the \\"Great Sphinx of Giza.\\" The Sphinx is a colossal limestone statue that embodies the body of a lion and the head of the ancient Egyptian solar deity known as Harmachis (or Horemakhet) in the form of a human male. Horemakhet, which means \\"Horus in the Horizon,\\" is an aspect of the ancient Egyptian god Horus associated with the rising and setting sun. Located on the Giza Plateau, in the vicinity of the famous pyramids, the Great Sphinx of Giza is one of the largest and oldest monumental sculptures in the world, with dimensions of 73 meters (240 feet) long, 20 meters (66 feet) high, and 6 meters (20 feet) wide. It was originally sculpted during the reign of Pharaoh Khafre (c. 2575-2467 BCE), who built the Second Pyramid of Giza. The Great Sphinx has played a significant role in the cultural and religious practices of ancient Egypt. Throughout history, the Sphinx has been revered and maintained by various rulers, who often added their own inscriptions and monuments alongside it. During the New Kingdom period (c. 1539-1075 BCE), the Sphinx was worshiped as the deity Horemakhet, and a temple was even constructed in front of the statue to facilitate ritual offerings. The Sphinx of Giza is a UNESCO World Heritage site and an iconic symbol of ancient Egypt's grandeur. The precise original purpose and meaning of the statue remain a topic of debate among scholars, as there are no surviving texts that reference its construction. Regardless, the Great Sphinx of Giza continues to marvel people around the globe with its artistic mastery, rich symbolism, and stunning endurance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The cordless function is nice, but the attachments would be better if they snapped into place rather than fitting snugly only to pop out occasionally while in use, which is irritating. But suction power's not too bad. On a scale of 1 to 5 for suction I'd give it a 3 or 4. It could be better but I wouldn't get this one if you plan on using it alot. For an occasional use it's okay. Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the given review, it seems that the user has a mixed opinion about the product.

Considering these points, it can be inferred that the user might recommend the product for occasional use but will not likely vouch for it as a go-to choice for those who plan to use it frequently or have higher expectations from their cleaning equipment.

Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

The statement provides comprehensive information about the inauguration of Sam Nujoma as the first President of Namibia. Sam Nujoma, born on May 12, 1929, was a prominent anti-apartheid activist and the founding leader of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which played a significant role in Namibia's struggle for independence from South Africa. Nujoma was a key figure in the lengthy process that eventually led to Namibia's independence in 1990. Namibia had been under South African administration since the end of World War I when the League of Nations granted South Africa a mandate to govern the territory, then known as South West Africa. The United Nations later revoked the mandate, but South Africa refused to relinquish control over the area. Years of conflict and diplomatic efforts took place before South Africa agreed to a settlement that paved the way for Namibia's eventual independence. On March 21, 1990, Namibia officially gained independence from South Africa, and Sam Nujoma was sworn in as the first President of the new nation. The statement highlights that the inauguration was attended by many notable international figures, including Nelson Mandela, who was released from prison the previous month after spending 27 years incarcerated due in large part to his fight against apartheid in South Africa. The event also drew representatives from 147 countries and 20 heads of state, underscoring the global significance of Namibia's independence and Nujoma's inauguration as the first President. Sam Nujoma served as the President of Namibia for 15 years, from 1990 to 2005. He played a key role in establishing and consolidating the country's democratic institutions and laying the foundation for Namibia's socioeconomic progress. After his tenure as President, Nujoma continued to remain active in political life.

To provide a deeper understanding, let's discuss these emissions and their connection to radiation. Radiation refers to the transmission of energy through waves or particles. It can be classified into two types: non-ionizing radiation (which does not carry enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules) and ionizing radiation (which carries enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, creating ions). Alpha, beta, and gamma emissions are all forms of ionizing radiation. 1. Alpha emissions: Alpha particles are helium nuclei that consist of two protons and two neutrons. They have a relatively high mass and a charge of +2. Because of their mass, they are unable to penetrate matter deeply and are stopped even by a piece of paper or human skin. However, they can cause significant damage if inhaled or ingested, as they can ionize surrounding atoms and molecules, damaging living tissue at a localized level. Alpha particles are usually emitted during the radioactive decay of heavy elements like uranium and plutonium. 2. Beta emissions: Beta particles are high-energy electrons (beta-minus particles) or positrons (beta-plus particles) that are emitted during radioactive decay. They have a much smaller mass compared to alpha particles and can penetrate matter to a greater extent. However, they can be stopped by a sheet of plastic or a thin layer of metal. Like alpha particles, beta particles can ionize atoms and molecules, causing damage to living tissue if they come into direct contact. 3. Gamma emissions: Gamma rays are high-energy electromagnetic waves that are emitted during the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei. They are much more penetrating than both alpha and beta particles, as they are not composed of particles and do not possess mass or charge, allowing them to pass through dense materials. Gamma rays can be stopped by a thick layer of lead or concrete. They can cause significant damage to living organisms, as they can ionize atoms and molecules within tissues, leading to cell damage and increasing the risk of cancer. In summary, alpha, beta, and gamma emissions are associated with radiation energy. These forms of ionizing radiation vary in their penetration capabilities and the damage they can cause to living organisms. It is important to understand and manage exposure to these types of radiation to minimize the risks they pose to health and safety."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Therefore, we can conclude that the statement \\"There are only 7 congressional districts in Wisconsin\\" is not true. Wisconsin has at least eight congressional districts, not seven. This inference is based on the principle that the numbering of congressional districts in any U.S. state starts from one and increases sequentially without any gaps. Hence, the existence of an 8th congressional district conclusively implies the existence of the first seven districts. Further, when dealing with the U.S. House of Representatives, it's worth knowing that the number of districts per state is not fixed at a specific number nationwide, but rather varies depending on each state's population; more populous states have a greater number of congressional districts.

While being interviewed by the psychiatrist Dr. Henry Bloom, Ricky tells the story of the murders his brother Billy committed throughout a series of several flashbacks using footage from the original film. These flashbacks have new shots to make Ricky appear in more of Billy's original story. After this, Ricky tells his own story: after Billy's death, he was adopted and given a good upbringing, but his trauma was never treated. After his foster father's death, Ricky loses his composure and commits a series of random murders, targeting people who are \\"naughty\\". A chance for a normal life seems to appear when he starts dating Jennifer Statson, but an unpleasant encounter with Jennifer's ex-boyfriend Chip sends Ricky over the edge. He kills Chip by electrocuting him with jumper cables that are attached to a car, while Jennifer watches. He then uses the antenna of the car to strangle Jennifer to death. A security guard sees this and as Ricky is about to get arrested, he grabs the guard's gun, shoots him in the forehead, and goes on a shooting spree, killing at least 3 people throughout a suburban neighborhood. He gets into a stand-off, where he tries and fails to commit suicide before getting arrested by the police. Cutting back to the present day, Ricky kills Dr. Bloom and escapes from the mental hospital, murdering a Salvation Army Santa and stealing the man's costume. Ricky plans to kill the now disfigured, wheelchair-bound Mother Superior, whom he blames for Billy's death. After chasing Mother Superior throughout her house, Ricky succeeds in decapitating her.

Please answer the following question: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio.

Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's \\"Shelter\\" for Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z, and proposed the title \\"Halo\\" after hearing Tedder play \\"angelic\\" chords. They wrote the song in three hours.According to Simon Cowell, owner of the music production company Syco Entertainment, Bogart and Tedder intended \\"Halo\\" for his client, singer Leona Lewis, who could not record the song because of her tight schedule. Cowell was upset that Beyoncé chose to record the song. David Balls, editor of the British media website Digital Spy, asked Tedder during an interview whether \\"Halo\\" had initially been written for Lewis.

The first appearance of the term 'affirmative action' was in the National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act, of 1935.:15 Proposed and championed by U.S. Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York, the Wagner Act was in line with President Roosevelt's goal of providing economic security to workers and other low-income groups. During this time period it was not uncommon for employers to blacklist or fire employees associated with unions. The Wagner Act allowed workers to unionize without fear of being discriminated against, and empowered a National Labor Relations Board to review potential cases of worker discrimination. In the event of discrimination, employees were to be restored to an appropriate status in the company through 'affirmative action'. While the Wagner Act protected workers and unions it did not protect minorities, who, exempting the Congress of Industrial Organizations, were often barred from union ranks.:11 This original coining of the term therefore has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today, but helped set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address an individual's unjust treatment.[citation needed] Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Which group of people did the Wagner Act protect?","completion":"The Wagner Act protected workers and unions.

Choose from: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","completion":"(1). yes Based on the given premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"The carrier has a deck area on it\\" is true. The detailed explanation is provided below: The premise states: \\"And then I saw, right in front of my eyes, on the deck of the carrier, a chief petty officer sliced into three parts by a propeller blade.\\" This sentence provides valuable information that can help us evaluate the hypothesis. First, the premise explicitly mentions \\"on the deck of the carrier,\\" which indicates that there is, in fact, a deck area on the carrier. This statement leads to the assumption that ships, such as carriers, usually have a deck, which is an essential part of their structure. The deck is the primary working surface on a ship and serves as a landing and take-off area for aircraft on carriers, also known as aircraft carriers. Second, a chief petty officer is mentioned, which is a naval rank and leads us to assume that this scenario takes place on a naval vessel. Naval ships, particularly carriers, are specifically designed to carry aircraft and are equipped with a suitable deck area for operational needs. Lastly, a propeller blade is mentioned as being the cause of the tragic event involving the chief petty officer. The presence of a propeller blade implies that the carrier is a powered vessel, which further makes the existence of a deck area plausible, as it is a necessary part of the ship's functioning. Taking all of these factors into account, the hypothesis that \\"The carrier has a deck area on it\\" is consistent with the given premise.

Write an article based on this summary: – For 341 years, scholars and occultists have been trying to decipher a letter purported to be from the Prince of Darkness, and this week, with the help of the Dark Web, they finally cracked the code. The story goes that Sister Maria Crocifissa della Concezione, a nun at the convent of Palma di Montechiaro in Southern Italy, woke up after a fainting spell on August 11, 1676, to discover several letters written in her hand in an indecipherable mix of symbols and languages, the Times of Israel reports. Sister Maria and her fellow nuns decided the letters were dictated to her by Lucifer in an attempt to drive Sister Maria away from God and the convent. Only one of the letters survived and for nearly 350 years it has flummoxed scholars, mystics, and codebreakers. But this week, researchers at the Ludum Science Center in Sicily cracked the code using an algorithm they found on the Dark Web, RT reports. “We primed the software with ancient Greek, Arabic, the Runic alphabet and Latin to descramble some of the letter,” Daniele Abate, director of the center, says. And while the translation they came up with does sound sinister—including claims that God and Jesus are \\"dead weights\\" and that the \\"system works for no one\\"—Abete believes the letter is proof less of the existence of Satan than Sister Maria's talent for languages and mental illness. “I personally believe that the nun had a good command of languages, which allowed her to invent the code, and [she] may have suffered from a condition like schizophrenia, which made her imagine dialogues with the Devil,” Abete says. (After 600 years, has a literary mystery been solved?)","completion":"Once upon a time, 341 years ago, a nun named Sister Maria Crocifissa della Concezione lived in a convent in Italy.

Sister Maria and her friends thought that the letters were written by a scary character, Lucifer, to make her leave the convent and forget about God. For many years, people tried to understand what the letters meant, but they couldn't. But recently, some smart people at a place called the Ludum Science Center in Sicily found a secret way to figure out what the letters said. They used something called an algorithm from a hidden part of the internet called the Dark Web. They discovered that the letter said strange things about God and Jesus, making them sound unimportant. But instead of believing that the letter was really from a scary character, the smart people think that Sister Maria was very good with languages and might have had a mental illness, which made her imagine talking to the scary character.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the largest room on the first floor of the building that houses the Paradise Room? ? The Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse\\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side. On the other side there is a small recess, which was described in an 1882 newspaper as \\"a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown\\". It is possible that this was a priest's hide, adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room. Less romantically, it may, alternatively, have been a garderobe or privy. This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century, and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose, though no such passages exist. The largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room, situated above the Great Hall.

Question: What shape rash is formed from a skin infection caused by trichophyton? Answer: ring-shaped","completion":"Supporting Facts for the Answer \\"ring-shaped rash caused by trichophyton\\": 1. Trichophyton is a genus of fungi that is known to cause skin infections, specifically tinea infections or ringworm. 2. When Trichophyton infects the skin, it triggers an immune response leading to inflammation and the characteristic ring-shaped rash. 3. The ring-shaped rash is referred to as \\"ringworm\\" not because of the presence of worms, but due to the circular, raised edges it forms around the infected area. 4. Trichophyton fungi feed on keratin, a protein found in the outer layers of the skin, hair, and nails. As the fungus grows outward from the center of infection, it leaves a clear central area, creating the ring appearance. 5. The rash caused by Trichophyton is typically itchy, red, and may have a scaly texture along its circular edges. 6. Tinea infections caused by Trichophyton can occur in various regions of the body, such as the scalp, feet, groin, and torso, exhibiting a similar ring-shaped rash in all cases. 7. Antifungal medications are used to treat ringworm infections and eliminate the Trichophyton fungus, thereby reducing inflammation and resolving the ring-shaped rash. In conclusion, the ring-shaped rash caused by Trichophyton is formed due to the fungus's growth pattern and the immune response triggered in the skin. This characteristic shape has given it the nickname \\"ringworm,\\" even though it is not caused by an actual worm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

While he is shooting, shy student Sam Merrick picks up the camera to take a look. Defensive and angry, George beats Sam up. Sam confides in both his protective older brother Rocky and his budding girlfriend, Millie, who urges Sam to take a higher road.Sam's older brother Rocky confides in his friends, Clyde and Marty, who are also familiar with George's reputation as a bully (he previously mocked Clyde for having two gay dads). While they agree that they need to stand up for Sam, they have different approaches. Clyde, who is sensitive and a bit of an outsider himself within the group, is more sympathetic and passive. Marty, who has issues with anger and trauma stemming from his father's suicide, his mother's apathy and his older brother's abuse, favors a more righteous form of revenge.Eventually, they hatch a plan with Sam to invite George on a fake birthday party for Sam, which George all-too eagerly accepts.

What is the name of the animated Disney film, released in 1959, that underperformed at the box office and stared a voice actress who also performed in an earlier animated Disney film in the same decade? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The name of the animated Disney film released in 1959 that underperformed at the box office and starred a voice actress who also performed in an earlier animated Disney film in the same decade is \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\" This film was a lavish, large-scale production, featuring distinct art styles inspired by Gothic art and blending medieval art with modern techniques. It was directed by Clyde Geronimi, Les Clark, Eric Larson, and Wolfgang Reitherman, with story adaptation by Erdman Penner. The film's official release date was January 29, 1959. Sleeping Beauty is based on Charles Perrault's fairy tale La Belle au bois dormant and the Grimm Brothers' Little Briar Rose. The film tells the story of Princess Aurora, who is cursed by the evil sorceress Maleficent to die on her 16th birthday by pricking her finger on a spinning wheel spindle. However, the curse is softened by one of the good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, so that instead of dying, Aurora falls into a deep sleep that can be broken only by true love's kiss. The voice actress in question is Mary Costa, who played the lead character, Princess Aurora. Mary Costa was earlier featured in another Disney animated film in the same decade, which was \\"Lady and the Tramp,\\" released in 1955. In \\"Lady and the Tramp,\\" Mary Costa performed a minor, uncredited role as the singing voice of one of the canine chorus members during the \\"La La Lu\\" lullaby scene. Her remarkable singing skills and engaging performance as Princess Aurora in Sleeping Beauty led to a prolific career as both an actress and an opera singer. Sleeping Beauty's underperformance at the box office can be attributed to a number of factors. The film's budget was massive for its time, at 6 million, due to the ambitious nature of the art style, meticulous attention to detail, and extended production process that took around six years to complete. A disappointing box office return of 5.3 million during its initial run led to a significant financial loss for the Walt Disney Company. While the critics praised its visual artistry and the musical score composed by George Bruns, audiences at the time didn't respond as enthusiastically. This might be, in part, due to the changing sensibilities of the viewers and the shift in the cultural landscape in the late 1950s. The commercial failure of Sleeping Beauty contributed to the company's decision to produce more cost-effective and simpler films in the following years. However, over time, the appreciation for Sleeping Beauty's artistry, sophistication, and unique take on a classic fairy tale grew, and it's now considered a masterpiece of animation by many. Subsequent re-releases in theaters helped the film to recoup its initial losses, and Sleeping Beauty has now earned lasting admiration and an important place in the history of Disney animation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this process, selecting the right materials can lead to significant improvements in terms of performance, sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and aesthetics. 1. Performance: The performance of a product or structure can be greatly influenced by the materials used in its construction. By carefully considering the specific requirements of the project, engineers and designers can select materials that possess the right balance of strength, ductility, temperature resistance, electrical conductivity, or any other physical or chemical properties that are relevant. For instance, in the aerospace industry, replacing aluminum with lightweight carbon fiber composites can lead to stronger, lighter, and more fuel-efficient aircraft, while in electronics, switching from silicon to graphene can enable faster and more efficient devices. 2. Sustainability: One of the most pressing concerns of modern times is the environmental impact of our choices, and this extends to the materials we choose to use. Changing materials to more sustainable options can help reduce a product's ecological footprint, not only through its reduced impact during manufacturing processes, but also by improving its disposal at the end of its life cycle. Examples include replacing plastic packaging with biodegradable materials or using recycled materials instead of raw resources to reduce waste and emissions in the production process. 3. Cost-effectiveness: In many cases, changing materials can lead to cost savings, either directly through reduced material costs or indirectly through improved efficiency, reduced waste, or longer product life. For example, replacing exotic metals such as titanium with cheaper, lightweight composites can lower production costs in the automotive and aerospace industries, while using self-healing materials in construction can reduce maintenance costs by extending the life of structures. 4. Aesthetics: The visual appeal and overall feel of a product or structure can be significantly impacted by the materials used in its construction, which is an essential consideration in some industries. In fashion, for instance, designers are always on the lookout for innovative materials and textiles that can give their creations a unique appearance and feel. Furthermore, in architecture and interior design, changing materials can drastically transform the style, atmosphere, and appearance of a space. 5. Health and safety: The materials used in various applications directly impact health and safety. As such, exploring new materials and technologies can help create safer spaces, improve fire resistance in buildings, and reduce exposure to hazardous substances. For instance, replacing asbestos (once widely used for insulation) with safer alternatives has been an important development in the construction industry. In conclusion, changing the materials used in various applications is a critical aspect of innovation and progression in numerous industries. It enables improvements in performance, sustainability, cost-effectiveness, aesthetics, and health and safety, making it a valuable process that benefits both consumers and producers alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment. Would experiment A's hydroxide have smaller or larger surface area than experiment B's hydroxide? Answer:","completion":"David's experiment involving the reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) gas aimed at determining the effect of the surface area of NaOH on the reaction. The surface area of a solid substance plays a significant role in chemical reactions as it influences the rate and extent of the reaction. In experiment A, David used solid pellets of NaOH. The pellets are generally compact structures with a limited surface area exposed to the environment. This limits the contact between the NaOH and the HCl gas, creating fewer sites for the reaction to occur. As a result, the rate of reaction will likely be slower in this case. On the other hand, in experiment B, David used ground NaOH. The process of grinding NaOH increases its surface area, creating a greater number of reaction sites available for interaction with the HCl gas. The increase in surface area results in increased points of contact between NaOH particles and the reactant gas, leading to a higher rate of reaction. To answer your question, experiment A's hydroxide (pellets) would have a smaller surface area than experiment B's hydroxide (ground NaOH). The larger surface area of the NaOH in experiment B plays a vital role in enhancing the rate of the reaction between NaOH and HCl gas. This phenomenon is the reason why David observed a difference between the two experiments. The increase in surface area in experiment B likely led to a faster and more pronounced reaction, demonstrating the importance of surface area in chemical reactions."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Large deep neural networks are powerful, but exhibit undesirable behaviors such as memorization and sensitivity to adversarial examples. In this work, we propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels. By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures. We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt labels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the training of generative adversarial networks.","completion":"Part #1: Generate a summary of the abstract.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer the following question: Information: - Carignan (also known as Mazuelo, Bovale Grande, Cariñena, Samsó, and Carignane) is a red Spanish/French wine grape variety that is widely planted throughout the western Mediterranean and around the globe. Along with Aramon, it was once considered one of the main grapes responsible for France's wine lake and was a substantial producer in jug wine production in California's Central Valley. - A Bordeaux wine is any wine produced in the Bordeaux region of France, centred on the city of Bordeaux and covering the whole area of the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of over 120,000 hectares, making it the largest wine growing area in France. Average vintages produce over 700 million bottles of Bordeaux wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (called \\"claret\\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) rosé and sparkling wines (Crémant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 8,500 producers or \\"châteaux\\". There are 54 appellations of Bordeaux wine. - French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 78 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world. French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France's regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive high-end wines sold internationally to more modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines were during the post war period. - Vitis (grapevines) is a genus of 79 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The genus is made up of species predominantly from the Northern hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture. - A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus \\"Vitis\\". - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - Ruby Cabernet is a red Olmo grape variety that is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan , it can produce wines with good colour and a pleasant cherry flavour , but is mostly blended into bulk wines . The purpose for the creation of the crossing of the grape varieties utilized to produce Ruby Cabernet was to obtain the superior quality of a Cabernet wine , and the resistance to heat of the Carignan combined in an inexpensive table wine . Even though the wine made from these grapes does not possess the distinctive flavor and the overall structure of other types of Cabernet wines , it does carry their fruitful essence . The grape for this type of red wine was developed for California 's hot climate , specially for regions such as the San Joaquin and the Napa Valleys . Ruby Cabernet has improved the quality of the bulk wines produced in these areas thanks to its natural , special acidity . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The Beqaa Valley (', ), also transliterated as Bekaa, Biqâ and Becaa and known in Classical antiquity as Coele-Syria, is a fertile valley in eastern Lebanon. It is Lebanon's most important farming region. Industry also flourishes in Beqaa, especially that related to agriculture. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans). - The wine lake refers to the continuing supply surplus of wine produced in the European Union. A major contributor to that glut is the Languedoc-Roussillon, which produces over one-third of the grapes grown in France. In 2007 it was reported that for the previous several vintages, European countries had been producing 1.7 billion more bottles of wine than they sell. Hundreds of millions of bottles of wine are turned into industrial alcohol every year, a practice that is sometimes described as \\"emergency distillation\\". - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. - Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Canada's Okanagan Valley to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Santa Cruz Mountains, Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawkes Bay, Australia's Margaret River and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s. - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work. - \\"Jug wine\\" is a term in the United States for inexpensive table wine (or \\"bulk wine\\") typically bottled in a glass jug. - Merlot is a dark blue-colored wine grape variety, that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines. The name \\"Merlot\\" is thought to be a diminutive of \\"merle\\", the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape. Its softness and \\"fleshiness\\", combined with its earlier ripening, makes Merlot a popular grape for blending with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin. - Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire's Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada and the United States, it is made into ice wine in those regions.

Article: When early colonial settlers went to America, they took many forms of dance to _ . Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille . In the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does? The callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \\"do-se-do your partner\\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \\"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade .\\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines. Although popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country.

Rodney Philip Hide was born in Oxford in Canterbury. His father, Philip Hide, owned a small mixed-farm at Cust and also drove trucks. In 1960, due to sickness, Philip Hide sold the small farm and moved to Rangiora, continuing to drive trucks until his retirement. Rodney Hide attended Rangiora High School, before gaining a degree in zoology and botany from the University of Canterbury. Many people had known for some time that Hide saw himself as a potential parliamentary leader of the ACT party, and he himself showed no reluctance in saying so. At several points, rumours circulated that Hide planned to challenge party leader Richard Prebble for his position, although such a challenge never emerged. When Prebble eventually announced his retirement, his critics claimed that this had been brought about by secret campaigning by Hide. However, Prebble himself has denied this claim and it appears more likely that he stood down for personal reasons, as he publicly claimed. When Prebble announced his retirement, Hide quickly indicated that he would seek the caucus leadership. Prebble, however, appeared unenthusiastic about the prospect of Hide succeeding him, and in a speech praising each of the new leadership contenders, pointedly dwelled on the others. The succession method chosen by Prebble also appeared to disfavour Hide: rather than a simple caucus vote, which a conventional leadership challenge would have called, a four-way election involved all ACT party members (although the election remained only \\"indicative\\"). Many people consider that the party organisation, in which Douglas has considerable influence, dislikes Hide. Hide campaigned against Stephen Franks, Ken Shirley, and Muriel Newman for the ACT party parliamentary leadership. In the race he claimed that his high public profile and his image of strength would prove crucial to ACT's political survival. Stephen Franks, seen as the primary \\"anti-Hide\\" candidate and a social conservative, had the backing of Roger Douglas. In the end, however, Hide prevailed, and the party introduced Hide as its new leader on 13 June 2004. Under Hide's leadership, the vote in the September 2005 elections severely reduced ACT's party parliamentary representation. ACT's share of the party vote dropped from over 7% of the total in 2002 to around 1.5%; its representation in Parliament fell from nine MPs to two. Despite this reduction, the party remained in parliament due to Hide winning the Epsom seat. As a consequence of its reduced share of the vote, ACT received a significant cut in taxpayer-funded Parliamentary resourcing and Hide shifted his electorate office in Remuera to Newmarket, the same location as that of ACT's head office. As a post-election strategy, Rodney Hide focused on his high-profile attacks on prominent Labour Party MPs. His campaign against alleged abuse of schoolchildren by Labour Party minister David Benson-Pope, which was verified by the now grown children involved, continued to make headlines in late 2005. In 2006, Hide voiced speculation on the leadership cadre of the National Party (then led by Don Brash), a strategy which gained him headlines but complicated the once co-operative relationship between ACT and National. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Rodney Hide is a man from a place called Canterbury in New Zealand, where his dad, Philip Hide had a small farm and drove trucks too. But they had to move to another place called Rangiora when his dad got sick. Rodney went to school in Rangiora and then to university to learn about animals and plants. Later, he became a part of a group called the ACT party, where he wanted to be the leader. There were stories saying that he wanted to replace the current leader, Richard Prebble, but he never said it openly. When Mr. Prebble decided to stop being the leader, Rodney said he wanted to be the next one. But, Mr. Prebble didn't seem to want Rodney to be the next leader. Rodney had to compete with three other people from the ACT party to become the new leader. He told everyone that he was popular and strong, which would be good for the ACT party. Even though another member, Stephen Franks, who was liked by an important person in the party, also wanted to be the leader, Rodney won and became the leader on 13th June 2004. Under Rodney's leadership, however, fewer people voted for the ACT party in the 2005 elections and because of this, the ACT party got less money from the government. Rodney continued his work by attacking members of another group called the Labour Party and questioning the leaders of another group called the National Party.

While the violence in the North was still raging, the South of Ireland was preoccupied with the split in the Dáil and in the IRA over the treaty. In April 1922, an executive of IRA officers repudiated the treaty and the authority of the Provisional Government which had been set up to administer it. These republicans held that the Dáil did not have the right to disestablish the Irish Republic. A hardline group of Anti-Treaty IRA men occupied several public buildings in Dublin in an effort to bring down the treaty and restart the war with the British. There were a number of armed confrontations between pro and anti-treaty troops before matters came to a head in late June 1922. Desperate to get the new Irish Free State off the ground and under British pressure, Michael Collins attacked the anti-treaty militants in Dublin, causing fighting to break out around the country. The subsequent Irish Civil War lasted until mid-1923 and cost the lives of many of the leaders of the independence movement, notably the head of the Provisional Government Michael Collins, ex-minister Cathal Brugha, and anti-treaty republicans Harry Boland, Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Liam Lynch and many others: total casualties have never been determined but were perhaps higher than those in the earlier fighting against the British. President Arthur Griffith also died of a stroke during the conflict. Following the deaths of Griffith and Collins, W. T. Cosgrave became head of government. On 6 December 1922, following the coming into legal existence of the Irish Free State, W. T.

It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling (or synthesis), and beatboxing. - Def Jam Recordings is an American record label, focused predominantly on hip hop and urban music, owned by Universal Music Group.

The film grossed 1,482,892 in its opening weekend and 2,702,578 during its theatrical run . - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - Russell Wendell Simmons (born October 4, 1957) is an American entrepreneur, producer and author.

Question: What trade did the ancient Somalis and others compete for?","completion":"The ancient Somalis and other civilizations, such as the Sabaeans, Parthians, and Axumites, competed for the wealthy Indo-Greco-Roman trade that thrived during the classical era. This period of rich international exchange, which roughly spanned from the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD, saw major powers and city-states establish a network of trade routes, connecting the Hellenistic, Indian, and Roman worlds. The Indo-Greco-Roman trade primarily involved the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultural practices between the Indian subcontinent, the Hellenistic world (encompassing Greece, Egypt, and the Near East), and the Roman Empire. These connections were facilitated through both land routes, such as the famous Silk Road, and maritime routes across the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean. Various items were traded across these routes, including luxurious and exotic products that were highly sought after by the elite of different societies. Among the items exchanged were: 1. Spices: A variety of spices from India, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom, were in great demand in the classical world, particularly in Rome where they were used in food, medicine, and religious rituals. 2. Textiles: Silk from China, cotton from India, and linens from Egypt were popular commodities for their comfort, durability, and symbolic value. Richly embroidered fabrics and clothing from the East were highly prized by nobles in the Hellenistic and Roman worlds. 3. Metals and precious stones: Gold, silver, and precious stones such as diamonds, rubies, and emeralds from India and the East Africa's Red Sea coast were highly valued for their beauty and rarity. They were used for making jewelry, coins, and other luxury items. 4. Art and artifacts: Classical Greek and Roman statues, pottery, and other artworks were sought by the elites in the eastern parts of the trade network. In return, Indian and African art, including carved ivory, textiles, and pottery, were desired by the Western cultures. 5. Knowledge and ideas: This trade network was not only focused on the exchange of material goods but also ideas, philosophies, and scientific knowledge. Concepts from Greek and Roman philosophy, mathematics, astrology, and medicine made their way into India and vice versa, enriching these realms with diverse and evolving intellectual traditions. Ancient Somalis and other city-states situated near Cape Guardafui, such as Opone, Essina, Sarapion, Nikon, Malao, Damo, and Mosylon, played a significant role in facilitating this trade, as they provided invaluable access to maritime routes through the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Moreover, they acted as intermediaries for the exchange of goods, culture, and knowledge, positioning them as central players in the vibrant, interconnected world of the classical era. In summary, the ancient Somalis and their neighbors competed for the wealthy Indo-Greco-Roman trade, which comprised a vast network of exchanges involving a wide range of goods, ideas, and cultural practices among the Hellenistic, Indian, and Roman worlds. These interactions over land and sea routes significantly shaped the economic, cultural, and intellectual landscape of the classical era."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yes, indeed. It's part of a growing worldwide trend toward outdoor education. The schools are called forest kindergartens. The numbers are small so far in the U.S., but the idea is well established in Europe, with schools in Scotland, England, and Switzerland. By far the most such schools are in Germany, which has more than 400 forest kindergartens. Some schools feature several hours of outdoor schooling. This is certainly the case with the Waldorf School of Saratoga Springs. Children there will be venturing out on the nearby Hemlock Trail to learn more about the natural world. Some lessons are focused on nature; others are academic topics delivered in a natural setting. In all cases, students are active-not sitting at desks or on mats on the floor but walking, running, jumping, solving problems like how to get the mud off the bottoms of their shoes before their parents find out. Seriously, the focus is on activity at these schools. Studies have shown that children's immune systems actually get stronger after all of the outdoor activity, and that graduates of forest kindergartens show a higher ability to learn when they progress through their academic careers. Other schools are all outdoors, all the time. This is the case with the Cedar Song Nature School, on Vashon Island, Washington. Students at this school spend their whole three-hour day outdoors, in a private five-acre forest, doing all kinds of physical activities. At these forest kindergartens, students learn science by observing and doing it, learn math by applying it to the natural world around them, learn letters and words by putting them together using sights and sounds. These students learn how to get along with one another, individually and in a group. They also develop healthy levels of self-confidence. Nowadays many children become obese because of sedentary activities like watching television and playing video games. These outdoor schools give children chances to learn just as much, if not more, from opening their eyes... Question: What is special about forest kindergartens? Answer: Possible answers: * Kids learn more than those at ordinary kindergartens.. * Students go outside when weather permits.. * They value activity very much.. * They are situated in forests.. The answer is:","completion":"Forest kindergartens are special because they are situated in forests and focus on outdoor education and activities, allowing students to learn through nature and experience hands-on learning.

Felix Graham, when he left poor Mary Snow, did not go on immediately to the doctor's shop. He had made up his mind that Mary Snow should never be his wife, and therefore considered it wise to lose no time in making such arrangements as might be necessary both for his release and for hers. But, nevertheless, he had not the heart to go about the work the moment that he left her. He passed by the apothecary's, and looking in saw a young man working sedulously at a pestle. If Albert Fitzallen were fit to be her husband and willing to be so, poor as he was himself, he would still make some pecuniary sacrifice by which he might quiet his own conscience and make Mary's marriage possible. He still had a sum of £1,200 belonging to him, that being all his remaining capital; and the half of that he would give to Mary as her dower. So in two days he returned, and again looking in at the doctor's shop, again saw the young man at his work. \\"Yes, sir, my name is Albert Fitzallen,\\" said the medical aspirant, coming round the counter. There was no one else in the shop, and Felix hardly knew how to accost him on so momentous a subject, while he was still in charge of all that store of medicine, and liable to be called away at any moment to relieve the ailments of Clapham. Albert Fitzallen was a pale-faced, light-haired youth, with an incipient moustache, with his hair parted in equal divisions over his forehead, with elaborate shirt-cuffs elaborately turned back, and with a white apron tied round him so that he might pursue his vocation without injury to his nether garments. His face, however, was not bad, nor mean, and had there not been about him a little air of pretension, assumed perhaps to carry off the combined apron and beard, Felix would have regarded him altogether with favourable eyes. 1.

Most games have a set of rules and a scoring system that players follow to earn points or achieve specific objectives. These points or objectives are then used to evaluate each player's performance throughout the game. By keeping track of these scores, players can determine who has performed the best and ultimately declare the winner of the game.

Answer: In spite of an urgent need for UAVs or drones to provide round the clock coverage for American troops during the Iraq War, the USAF did not establish a new career field for piloting them until the last year of that war and in 2014 changed its RPA training syllabus again, in the face of large aircraft losses in training, and in response to a GAO report critical of handling of drone programs. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choose from: - yes. - no.","completion":"Yes. The United States Air Force (USAF) established a new career field for piloting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and drones during the Iraq War, which lasted from 2003 to 2011. This urgency was due to the need for continuous coverage and support for American troops during the war. As the conflict progressed, the USAF continually adapted and refined its training programs to address concerns about the handling of drone operations and to minimize losses. In the final year of the Iraq War, the USAF officially created a career field dedicated to piloting UAVs and drones, as their importance on the battlefield became more evident. The development and implementation of drone technology transformed warfare, allowing for improved surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeted strikes, with reduced risk to human pilots. By 2014, the USAF made further changes to its Remote Piloted Aircraft (RPA) training syllabus in response to significant aircraft losses in training exercises and a critical Government Accountability Office (GAO) report. This report highlighted the need for improved management and handling of drone programs, as the USAF sought to optimize their use in modern warfare. Overall, the establishment of a specialized career field for UAVs and drone piloting in the USAF during the Iraq War signaled a significant shift in military strategy and prioritization. This development demonstrated the growing recognition of the importance of these technologies within the context of modern conflict, and an effort to meet the changing demands and challenges of warfare in the 21st century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.” Tim is trying to boil two pots of water, pot A and pot B. Tim has a device which lets him see what the average kinetic energy is of the particles in each pot is. After examining each pot, Tim discovers that pot A has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, and pot B's particles have a low average kinetic energy. Which pot is closer to boiling? The answer is:","completion":"Pot A is closer to boiling because it has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, which indicates a higher temperature. When water reaches its boiling point (100°C or 212°F at sea level), its particles have enough kinetic energy to overcome the attractive forces and change from a liquid to a gas state.

Question: Kelsey is bored in class, and sees a coil of wire with electricity running through it. There is a box of random pieces of iron on the teacher's desk so she goes and picks up two of them. Piece A she simply puts on her desk to use later, and Piece B she slowly passes through the coil of wire. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which piece of iron is more magnetized? Hint: Our knowledge of electromagnets developed from a series of observations. In 1820, Hans Oersted discovered that a current-carrying wire produced a magnetic field. Later in the same year, André-Marie Ampere discovered that a coil of wire acted like a permanent magnet and François Arago found that an iron bar could be magnetized by putting it inside of a coil of current-carrying wire. Finally, William Sturgeon found that leaving the iron bar inside the coil greatly increased the magnetic field. Answer:","completion":"Piece B is more magnetized. Step 1: Identify the key information in the paragraph. The paragraph provides information about electromagnets, mentioning that a coil of wire acts like a permanent magnet and an iron bar can be magnetized by putting it inside a coil of current-carrying wire. Step 2: Relate the information to the question. The question is asking which piece of iron is more magnetized. Since Kelsey puts Piece A on her desk and does not interact with the coil of wire, it does not have any magnetization. On the other hand, Kelsey passes Piece B through the coil of current-carrying wire, which should magnetize it according to the information provided. Step 3: Determine the answer based on the information and the question. Based on the fact that Piece B is passed through the coil of wire and Piece A is left on the desk, Piece B is more magnetized due to the interaction with the magnetic field created by the current in the coil of wire."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral, the main commercial source for niobium, and columbite. The name comes from Greek mythology: \\"Niobe\\", daughter of \\"Tantalus\\" since it is so similar to tantalum. - Stibnite, sometimes called antimonite, is a sulfide mineral with the formula SbS. This soft grey material crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group. It is the most important source for the metalloid antimony. The name is from the Greek \\"stibi\\" through the Latin \\"stibium\\" as the old name for the mineral and the element antimony. - Pyrochlore (Na,Ca)NbO(OH,F) is a mineral group of the niobium end member (pyrochlore supergroup). - A metalloid is any chemical element which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or that has a mixture of them. There is neither a standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use in the literature of chemistry. - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials. - A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy. - Antimony is a chemical element with symbol Sb (from ) and atomic number 51. A lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (SbS). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name, kohl. Metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery. In the West, it was first isolated by Vannoccio Biringuccio and described in 1540. - Vannoccio Biringuccio, sometimes spelt Vannocio Biringuccio (c. 1480 c. 1539), was an Italian metallurgist. He is best known for his manual on metalworking, \\"De la pirotechnia\\", published posthumously in 1540. Biringuccio is considered by some as the father of the foundry industry as \\"De la pirotechnia\\" is the first printed account of proper foundry practice. It also gives details of mining practice, the extraction and refining of numerous metals, alloys such as brass, and compounds used in foundries and explosives. It preceded the printing of \\"De re metallica\\" by Georgius Agricola by 14 years. - In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons. - A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, \\"Z\\"). There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust. - Stibiconite is an antimony oxide mineral with formula : Sb3O6 ( OH ) . Its name originates from Greek \`\` stibi '' ( antimony ) and \`\` konis '' ( powder ) , alluding to its composition and habit . It is a member of the pyrochlore super group . What entity does 'stibiconite' has the relation 'subclass of' with? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Stibiconite has the relation 'subclass of' with the pyrochlore supergroup. The pyrochlore supergroup is a group of minerals with a general formula A2B2X6Y, where A, B, X, and Y represent various elements. Stibiconite is a member of this supergroup due to its antimony oxide mineral composition with the formula Sb3O6 (OH). Pyrochlores are typically found in various geological environments such as pegmatites, carbonatites, and alkaline intrusive complexes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: This article: When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

Movie title: Jamaica Inn Movie plot: Jamaica Inn is the headquarters of a gang of wreckers led by the innkeeper Joss Merlyn (Leslie Banks). The wreckers are responsible for a series of engineered shipwrecks in which they extinguish coastal warning beacons to cause ships to run aground on the rocky Cornish coast. Then they kill the surviving sailors and steal the cargo from the wrecks. Beautiful, young Mary Yellan (Maureen O'Hara) is travelling to Jamaica Inn in a carriage, but the driver is afraid to stop there and drives a long way past the inn in spite of her repeated demands that he stop. Instead, he drops her off near the home of the local squire and justice of the peace, Sir Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton). She meets him and requests the loan of a horse so she can go back to Jamaica Inn. Pengallan warns her not to go there. Nevertheless, Mary says she just came from Ireland, and as the orphaned niece of Joss's wife Patience (Marie Ney), she intends to live at Jamaica Inn. Unable to convince her to stay, Pengallan accompanies Mary to Jamaica Inn. When Joss meets Mary, he tries to kiss her and push himself on her. Patience is distraught to learn her sister, Mary's mother, has died. When Mary tells Joss that Pengallan has accompanied her to Jamaica Inn, Joss goes upstairs and reports to Pengallan. We learn that Pengallan is the secret criminal mastermind behind the wrecking gang, who finds out when well-laden ships are passing near the coast, determines when and where the wrecks are to be done, disposes of the stolen cargo, and uses the booty to support his lavish lifestyle, passing a small fraction of the takings back to Joss and the gang. In another part of the inn, the gang convenes to discuss why they get so little money for their efforts. They suspect Jem Traherne (Robert Newton), a gang member who has been with them for only two months, of embezzling goods.

The short answer is: Who knows? The joke that causes a burst of laughter from one listener might be met with a puzzled look from another. In general, you should avoid jokes at any business or social gathering where there are more than two people in your conversational group. If there are only two people -- and they consist of you and your best friend -- go ahead and tell it. Admittedly, a few people possess a perfect sense of timing, appropriateness, and joke delivery. You are probably not one of them. You might be quite funny and have many great jokes. But there's a place for jokes -- over dinner with family, hiking with friends, but business or social affairs with colleagues and acquaintances are not it. It takes a whole other level of joke-telling ability to put a joke into the more formal conversations. The best jokes come into the conversation so that by the time listeners realize a joke is in progress, the punchline that produces humour is being delivered -- to their surprise and delight. Jokes don't translate well when you're in a group with mixed backgrounds: those whose first language is not English, those who might not understand a special term or an \\"in\\" expression, young people who wouldn't catch a reference to some bit of culture familiar to older people -- and vice versa . Never joke about another person in the group -- about their name, habits, hometown, profession, appearance, or past. It's not a question of whether the joke is cheery or appropriate. No one enjoys being singled out this way. When you are the subject of the joke, the laughter doesn't feel good no matter how hard you try to tell yourself they're not laughing at you.

I have had 3 visits here and I can truthfully conclude that it is not my favorite place to be. 1st- Just trying it out and had their pasta. It was overly cheesy and it left me feeling disappointed, but my friend enjoyed his French Dip. Frozen Chocolate however was delicious. 2nd- Bought their \\"New Years Package\\" to ring in 2012 and this time was probably the best time out of the bunch. The manager was handled all of the booking and payment answered every email I had with inquiries very diligently and I appreciated that. For about 175 per person we were able to dine window-side inside and had a fantastic view of the strip. Our table was beautifully decorated with many fun adornments for us to use when it came time for the fireworks and also a complimentary glass of champagne for celebration time. Our server that night, however, was NONEXISTENT! The only things he did was bring us our drinks and took our food order. The busser was who came out to give us our food. This completely pissed me off because gratuity was already added on to take care of him. Of course there were times where we wanted to order more, needed refills, or something else and he was either on his phone near the back of the room or nonexistent. The food was seriously lacking with tasteless angus steak and the best thing was the crabcakes. Nonetheless, when it came time for the fireworks, we went right on outside and counted down with everyone else on the strip. 3rd- We had a party of 8 and I attempted to get a table for us around 9 PM. Plenty of open seats and the rest of my party went to the \\"treats\\" section to look at everything since I had people visiting from out of town so this place intrigued them. I was told by the hostess to go round up my party again and we would be seated immediately. I rounded them up after they just started looking around only to be told it will take 5 minutes to seat us, but it ended up being about 10 minutes. I am not trying to be picky, but if you are going to tell me to do something then also follow up on your promise as well please. I was told from our server that they no longer had Frozen Hot Chocolate so I opted for the Cookies and Cream Shake which I honestly have to say was even better! Overall, if I can avoid going here again.. I would definitely avoid it. High prices for sucky food and desserts. Best things are their expensive shakes, lol.

Question: Given the following context: During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK.

After the opening three games of the campaign, More now have only a 50% record and sit in fourth place, two points behind local rivals Kingussie, who won 2-0 at home to Glenurquhart.

In Kiltarlity, Kilmallie looked to be on easy street Ryan Stewart, then Mark Graham gave the Lochaber side a 2-0 lead over Lovat.

The 35-year-old denies one charge of perverting the course of justice.","completion":"Title: Policewoman Texts Driver She Pulled Over, Accused of Hiding Important Facts Hello, little friends! Today, I want to tell you a story about a policewoman named PC Saheena Tegally. She is in a little bit of trouble because she did something she wasn't supposed to do. Let's learn what happened. One day, while Saheena was out with her two police friends in Highgate, a place in north London, they saw a man driving a car. They stopped him because they thought he didn't have something called \\"car insurance.\\" That's like a special promise that if the car gets hurt or anything bad happens, a special helper called an \\"insurance company\\" will help fix everything, but the car's owner has to pay them some money first. It's important because the law says every car owner must have it. After they pulled the man over, which means they stopped his car to talk to him, Saheena started to do something she wasn't supposed to do. She sent the man messages on her phone, just a few hours after they stopped his car. Yikes! That's not what a police officer should do. Now, Saheena is in trouble because people think she tried to hide the truth about the man's car not having insurance. This is very serious because police officers are supposed to always be honest! They need to keep everyone safe and follow the rules of the law, and not pretend like something isn't wrong when it really is. Saheena is 35 years old, and she is saying that she didn't do anything wrong. She says she didn't try to change the way things were supposed to happen. This is called \\"perverting the course of justice,\\" which means making something happen that isn't true or right. So, little friends, that's the story about Policewoman Saheena. Remember, it's always important to tell the truth and follow the rules, so everyone can be safe and happy! And if you see a police officer working hard to keep your neighborhood safe, don't forget to give them a big smile and say, \\"Thank you!\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper.

Today, many academics feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write. We recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts. We did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use. 1. They “time-block” their writing in advance Scheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week. What seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful. “When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.” Researchers found that writers who don't time-block their writing in advance probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. not enough information B.

A: 1. Stick the end of the hot dog with a firm sharp stick, making sure it's secure - This ensures that the hot dog will not fall into the fire and will cook evenly. 2. Hold the hot dog over the fire (not in the fire) - This avoids charring the hot dog and ensures the hot dog cooks more evenly. 3. Rotate to prevent burning until cooked to your liking - Rotating the hot dog will evenly distribute the heat, ensuring the entire hot dog cooks more consistently. B: 1. Stick the end of the hot dog with a firm sharp stick, making sure it's secure - This ensures that the hot dog will not fall into the fire and will cook evenly. 2. Hold the hot dog over the fire (preferably in the fire) - This step can result in burning or charring the hot dog, leading to uneven cooking. 3. Do not rotate as this will prevent burning and will not cook to your liking - Not rotating the hot dog can cause different parts of the hot dog to cook unequally, as one side may be exposed to higher heat at one time. By comparing the steps, Choice A appears to be the better solution. It helps ensure even cooking, prevents burning, and allows for personal preference in cooking. Choice B has a higher risk of burning and uneven cooking due to its method.

Intellectual property: The stated objective of most intellectual property law (with the exception of trademarks) is to \\"Promote progress.\\" By exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works, society and the patentee/copyright owner mutually benefit, and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work. Some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be \\"absolute protection\\". \\"If some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation, they reason, more is better. The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions\\". This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of \\"real\\" property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric.

Approval from higher management: Depending on the company structure, Taylor may need to seek approval from their supervisor or other higher-ups to hire an additional staff member or bring someone on board temporarily. This may involve presenting a case for the new hire, outlining the benefits and justifying the costs. 3. Defining the role and responsibilities: Taylor should create a clear job description, including the key skills required, responsibilities, and any relevant qualifications or certifications. This will help both Taylor and Ash understand the expectations of the new role. 4. Establishing compensation and benefits: Before offering Ash the job, Taylor must determine the salary and any other associated benefits for the position, taking into consideration the company's budget, industry salary standards, and Ash's experience and skill level. 5. Assessing Ash's qualifications and experience: It is crucial for Taylor to evaluate Ash's background, including education, work experience, and any relevant skills, to ensure that they are the right fit for the role. This may involve reviewing their resume, conducting interviews, and even checking references. 6. Ensuring legal compliance: Taylor must be aware of any legal requirements for hiring new employees, such as obtaining work permits or visas, providing workers' compensation insurance, and complying with labor laws and regulations. 7. Preparing the workspace and necessary equipment: Taylor should ensure that the office or workspace is ready for Ash, including setting up a workstation with necessary equipment, software, and resources. 8. Onboarding and orientation: Once Ash is on board, Taylor should arrange for an orientation period, where Ash is introduced to the company culture, policies, and procedures. This may involve setting up training sessions or meetings with the existing team members. By completing these steps prior to offering Ash the opportunity to work with them, Taylor will ensure a seamless and successful integration into the workplace, benefiting both the company and Ash."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open.

However, it is important to properly analyze the context and meaning of the statement before confirming the hypothesis \\"Captain Bayliss had a cool tone\\" to be true. Before delving into the interpretation, let's first break down the sentence: 1. \\"Captain Bayliss.\\" - This phrase is referring to the subject of the sentence, Captain Bayliss. 2. \\"It was acknowledgment rather than a greeting,\\" - The sentence indicates that what is being expressed is a mere acknowledgment of Captain Bayliss's presence or actions instead of a warm or cordial greeting. 3. \\"delivered in a cool tone.\\" - This phrase specifies the manner in which the acknowledgment was delivered. From a comprehensive understanding of the statement, it can be deduced that the cool tone was attributed to the way the acknowledgment of Captain Bayliss was delivered. The sentence does not necessarily imply that Captain Bayliss themselves had a cool tone. Given this analysis, it would be incorrect to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Captain Bayliss had a cool tone\\" is true. Instead, a more accurate hypothesis based on the premise would be \\"The acknowledgment of Captain Bayliss was delivered in a cool tone.\\" This interpretation focuses on the delivery of the acknowledgment rather than attributing the cool tone to Captain Bayliss directly. In conclusion, while it may be tempting to take the statement at face value and assume that Captain Bayliss had a cool tone, further analysis of the sentence reveals that the cool tone referred to the way the acknowledgment of Captain Bayliss was delivered, rather than to Captain Bayliss themselves.

Two More Potential Snowmakers Ahead Meteorologist Domenica Davis looks at the forecast for two more potential snowmakers ahead. At a Glance Winter Storm Riley bombed out off the New England coast and produced destructive impacts in the East March 1-4. Coastal flooding and beach erosion occurred over multiple high tides, yielding the third-highest tide on record in Boston. Damaging winds were reported from western New York and New England to the mountains of North Carolina, knocking out power to nearly 2 million. Parts of New York state picked up 2 to 3 feet of snow, with one location receiving as much as 40 inches. Riley first brought snow to the upper Midwest and Great Lakes Feb. 28-March 1. Winter Storm Riley became an intense nor'easter after undergoing bombogenesis off the New England coast March 2-3, producing damaging winds and coastal flooding from New York and New England to North Carolina, following a quick burst of snow in the upper Midwest and Great Lakes Feb. 28-March 1. (NEWS: At Least 9 Dead, 1.9 Million Without Power ) Riley developed in the Midwest on the last day of February, but it really took shape off the coast of New England March 2-3. The winter storm bombed out off the coast of Massachusetts, bringing near-record high tides to the state and feet of snow across the interior Northeast. This second monster winter storm of the season for the Northeast damaged seawalls and caused extreme beach erosion. More than 1.9 million were reportedly without power from the mid-Atlantic to the Northeast by the morning of March 3. High Winds Low pressure just off the southern New England coast underwent explosive development known as bombogenesis , defined by a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure of at least 24 millibars in a period of 24 hours or less. From 7 p.m. EST March 1 to 4 p.m. EST March 2, the pressure dropped from 1000 millibars to 974 millibars, or a 26-millibar drop in only 21 hours. Four different locations in Massachusetts reported winds gusts of 90 mph or more, including Barnstable (93 mph), East Falmouth (92 mph), Wellfleet (91 mph) and Nantucket (90 mph). Wind gusts of 80 mph or greater were clocked in Scituate, Massachusetts, and at Little Compton, Rhode Island (83 mph). Six states recorded wind gusts of at least 70 mph. Among those locations reporting 70-mph gusts or higher were Boston's Logan Airport (70 mph), Bayville, New York (78 mph), Cape May, New Jersey (71 mph), and Washington's Dulles Airport (71 mph). Dulles Airport reported gusts over 50 mph for more than 12 hours straight, a rare occurrence , according to the National Weather Service. In addition to all the wind damage and power outages, these high winds wreaked havoc for some flights into Washington D.C., including extreme turbulence on one flight to Dulles Airport and one aborted landing attempt at Reagan National Airport. A section of the American Airlines hangar's roof at New York's LaGuardia Airport appeared to have been torn off by high winds, though the initial assessment showed the building was still structurally sound. As of early March 3, 751 reports of wind damage had been received by local National Weather Service offices in 36 hours covering the duration of the storm. The most numerous wind damage reports came in from Virginia (185 reports), Massachusetts (133 reports), then Maryland (108 reports), though wind damage was reported from Maine to North Carolina. Avery County, North Carolina, 911 reported numerous trees downed across the county on the evening of March 1. A peak gust over 100 mph was clocked atop Grandfather Mountain , North Carolina, early March 2. Winds were still gusting over 40 mph – mainly in southeastern New England, but also in a few other spots along the East Coast – by the morning of March 3. Unfortunately, those gusts were still strong enough to trigger yet more wind damage in parts of southeastern Massachusetts. Coastal Flooding Water inundated parts of the Massachusetts coastline during the first high-tide cycle late-morning on March 2, and a second period of higher tide occurred late that night with moderate flooding observed. Moderate flooding was observed at tide gauges in Scituate, Massachusetts, and Boston Harbor on the morning of March 2. The storm tide at Boston Harbor peaked at its third-highest level on record, only topped by Winter Storm Grayson in January and the Blizzard of '78. The storm caused considerable damage in the coastal town of Scituate : A car floating in floodwaters in Braintree, Massachusetts, prompted a water rescue. These long-lived winds blowing over a long stretch of the ocean, piling onshore, led to additional minor coastal flooding along parts of the Northeast Seaboard through March 4 in some areas. Flood waters were very slow to recede between high-tide cycles. Flooding at high tides through the morning of March 4 approached levels that typically produce widespread flooding of roads in Atlantic and Ocean counties , Ocean City and Somers Point , Wildwood Crest, Cape May and West Cape May, New Jersey , and Kent and Sussex counties, Delaware , according to the National Weather Service. In the Outer Banks of North Carolina , oceanside and soundside flooding March 3-4 inundated stretches of Highway 12 near times of high tide. Snow Winter Storm Riley developed into a low-pressure system in the eastern Great Lakes on the morning on March 1, initially bringing snow to parts of Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio. The storm began to push into the interior Northeast late that day with heavy rain and moderate snow. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour were observed across eastern Michigan on the afternoon of March 1. Ann Arbor, Michigan, picked up 3.1 inches of snow in only 2.5 hours early- to mid-afternoon March 1. Riley's snow then kicked into high gear on the night of March 1 into March 2. The town of Wyoming, New York, east of Buffalo, picked up a whopping 24 inches of snow in the 24 hours ending the morning of March 2. Thundersnow was observed in parts of western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania overnight March 1 into early March 2. Richmondville, New York – in Schoharie County, west of Albany – led the pack with 40 inches of total snowfall.

This nor'easter, like the one in January, could reach bombogenesis -- or become a \\" bomb cyclone \\" -- by dropping at least 24 millibars of atmospheric pressure in 24 hours. Some forecast models predict a sudden pressure plummet Friday evening off the Atlantic coast. Even if this storm doesn't \\"bomb out,\\" the coastal low will pack an incredible punch, with places from eastern Long Island in New York to Boston likely to get hit hardest. With the moon full, the tide is at its highest point of the month. On top of that, the storm's surge could drive 3 to 4 feet of water into coastal neighborhoods. Along the shore, wave heights will be 4 to 8 feet, breaking along the shoreline and exacerbating flooding.

Despite the countless hours spent perusing online stores and brick-and-mortar shops, we've all found ourselves staring at piles of ill-fitting clothes that do nothing for our confidence and comfort. But fear not, weary shoppers! The answer to your problems could simply lie in understanding the correct way to measure yourself and your shirts. In this article, we will be discussing the importance of seeking help, wearing the right attire, proper measuring techniques, and recording accurate measurements. 1. Ask for Help It comes as no surprise that accurately measuring oneself can be a practically acrobatic task. This is where enlisting the assistance of a friend, family member, or even a professional tailor can prove invaluable. Having an extra pair of eyes and hands ensures that the measuring tape is held correctly, while also maintaining proper posture and positioning. This results in more accurate measurements, ultimately making the difference between a well-fitting shirt and one that's destined for the return pile. 2. Wear the Right Sort of Shirt The kind of shirt you wear during the measuring process plays a crucial role in determining the final fit. It's essential to wear a shirt that closely matches the desired fit of the new shirt you're shopping for. This will provide a more reliable basis for comparison and accurate measurements. In addition, make sure that the shirt you're wearing is not too tight, as this could skew the results. A well-fitting shirt should allow for comfortable breathing and movement, without appearing baggy or overly loose. 3. Measure Across the Front of Your Body Measuring across the front of your body is crucial when determining the perfect shirt fit. There are a few key measurements that need to be taken into consideration, including chest, waist, and hips. - Chest: To measure the chest, have your helper wrap the measuring tape around the widest part of your chest, typically just under the arms. Ensure that the tape is parallel to the floor and not too tight or loose. - Waist: The waist measurement is taken at the narrowest point of the torso, typically just above the navel. Once again, ensure that the tape is parallel to the floor and not too tight or loose. - Hips: For the hips, measure around the widest part, usually at the level of your hipbones. Maintain the tape parallel to the floor and keep it snug without cutting into the skin. 4. Write Down the Measurement Once all the measurements have been taken, it's essential to record them accurately. It's easy to forget these crucial numbers or mix them up, so make sure to jot them down immediately. Having a documented record of your measurements is not only helpful when shopping for shirts but can also come in handy when purchasing other clothing items. Remember to update these measurements periodically, as our bodies tend to change over time. Conclusion Obtaining accurate shirt measurements can make all the difference in finding clothing that fits and flatters. By asking for help, wearing the right sort of shirt, measuring across the front of your body, and writing down the measurements, you can confidently navigate the world of shirt shopping and ensure that you always look and feel your best.

Pharmacoresistance is a common problem hindering treatment of epilepsy. A possible cause for this resistance is the overexpression of efflux drug transporters, e.g. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may decrease extracellular antiepileptic drugs levels in brains of intractable epilepsy patients. Another transmembrane drug transporter is the organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (Oatp2), which is colocalized with P-gp in many polarized tissues. However, a role for Oatp2 in the development of multidrug resistance has not been established. In the present work, we investigated the expression of drug transporters Oatp2 and P-gp in brain, liver and kidney of rats with chronic epilepsy induced by lithium-pilocarpine.', 'Chronic epilepsy was elicited after status epilepticus (SE) induced by lithium-pilocarpine in adult Wistar rats. Following SE, expression of Oatp2 and P-gp protein was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis and messenger RNA (mRNA) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Levels of the drug transporters were compared in brain, liver and kidney of chronic epileptic and control rats.', 'Both Oatp2 and P-gp were expressed in the brain, liver and kidney but predominantly in the brain. In the brain, Oatp2 and P-gp immunopositive cells were observed in brain capillary endothelium and choroid plexus epithelium. Compared with control rats, Oatp2 protein expression in brain was significantly decreased, while P-gp was obviously increased in chronic epileptic rats. P-gp mRNA was also significantly higher in brains of chronic epileptic rats, whereas the expression of Oatp2 did not change.

So I was laying down, maybe at 60% in terms of how close I was to falling asleep, so I just had to lay down for like 5 more minutes. But there are a lot of noises, and they freak me out even though I just sorta pretend that they’re definitely a cat or my dog or something. So, I’m already slightly spooked, but I’m ignoring it and going to sleep anyway. But then, I hear my door open. That isn’t too weird, I do have cats, so even though by this point my fear is intense, I just sorta blow it off and keep trying to sleep. And then, something that’s never happened in a situation like this, I feel something moving towards me on my bed. It feels like a cats movements, with light feet making slight reverberations on the bed. So my fear goes away entirely, and I’m like “Oh okay, it’s just the cat, that’s good.” And I lift my blankets off my head to let my cat under with me, and because the fear seemed to make the atmosphere under there very hot and tense, and then I look at my bed and there’s nothing. So I just pretend nothing happened and go to sleep, but that still sticks with me and even though it’s kinda underwhelming I still think it was very strange since I wasn’t at the “edge of consciousness” stage of going to sleep, so I feel like the chances I imagined it aren’t too high.

When I had trouble bending over to tie my shoes and I wasn’t pregnant. When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down.

Movie title: Bashu, the Little Stranger Movie plot: The film is about a young boy from Khuzestan province, in the south of Iran, during the IranâIraq War. His parents are killed in a bombing raid on his home village and he escapes on a cargo truck to the north. Eventually he gets off and finds refuge on the farm of a Gilak woman, Na'i, who has two young children of her own. Initially, Na'i tries to shoo Bashu away, but later takes pity on him and leaves food out for him. Although Na'i is initially ambivalent toward Bashu, and he is initially suspicious of her, they come to trust one another, and Bashu becomes a member of the family, even calling Na'i \\"mom\\". Being that Bashu speaks Arabic, while Na'i and her children speak Gilaki, they have trouble communicating with each other, although Bashu is able to speak and read Persian (for example in the scene where he picks up the school textbook, reading a passage from it in an attempt to appease the children fighting). In a gesture of reciprocation and perhaps love, Bashu cares for Na'i when she falls ill, as she had done for him, crying for her and beating a drum in prayer. Throughout the film, Na'i maintains correspondence with her husband, a war veteran looking for employment, who has been gone for quite some time. She tells him about Bashu, and implores him to return home in time to help with the harvest. Bashu becomes Na'i's helper on the farm, and even accompanies her to the bazaar to sell her goods. Throughout the film, Bashu sees visions of his dead family members, which cause him to wander off. Ultimately, however, he and Na'i are always reunited. The other adults in the village harangue Na'i about taking Bashu in, often deriding his dark skin and different language, and making comments about washing the dark off of his skin. In addition to the village adults, the school age children taunt and beat Bashu, although the children prove ultimately to be more willing to accept Bashu than the adults.

A urinary tract infection (uti) is very common but can be unpleasant and very uncomfortable. Utis are an infection of your upper urinary tract (kidney and ureters), lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra), or both.","completion":"If you suspect you have a urinary tract infection (UTI), it's crucial to act quickly to minimize complications and discomfort. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to alleviate a UTI fast. 1. Consult a healthcare professional: If you suspect you are experiencing the symptoms of a UTI (burning sensation when urinating, frequent urination, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, discomfort in the lower abdomen), it is essential to consult your doctor or other healthcare professional. They will be able to perform a urine test and recommend appropriate treatment based on the severity of your UTI. 2. Take prescribed antibiotics: UTIs are commonly caused by bacteria like E. coli, and your healthcare provider will prescribe an antibiotic to combat the infection. Make sure to follow your prescribed dosage and complete the full course of treatment, even if you start feeling better before it's finished. This is crucial for avoiding antibiotic resistance and preventing the infection from returning. 3. Hydrate with water: Drinking plenty of water helps dilute your urine and flush out bacteria from your urinary system. Aim to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water every day and avoid caffeine, alcohol, and sugary beverages, as these can exacerbate UTI symptoms. 4. Use pain relief: Over-the-counter pain relief medication, such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, can help alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with a UTI. Be sure to follow the instructions on the packaging and consult your healthcare provider if you have any medical conditions or are taking other medications. 5. Apply heat: Applying heat to your lower abdomen can help alleviate UTI-related discomfort. Use a heating pad or warm compress on the affected area for 15-20 minutes several times a day, making sure the heat is not too intense to avoid burns or skin irritation. 6. Avoid irritants: Harsh soaps, bubble baths, and other products with potentially irritating chemicals can further aggravate your urinary tract. Opt for unscented and hypoallergenic products during this time to minimize irritation. 7. Take over-the-counter UTI relief medications: Some over-the-counter medications, such as Azo (phenazopyridine), can help relieve UTI symptoms like burning and urgency. However, they only provide temporary relief and do not cure the infection. Always consult your healthcare provider before using these medications. 8. Practice good hygiene: Always wipe from front to back after using the toilet to prevent the spread of bacteria and take showers instead of baths. Change underwear daily and choose cotton fabric, which is more breathable, to promote a healthier environment for your urinary tract. 9. Modify your diet: Foods and drinks high in vitamin C can help boost your immune system and make your urine more acidic, which may hinder bacterial growth. Incorporate citrus fruits, berries, leafy greens, and bell peppers into your diet and avoid bladder irritants like caffeine and spicy foods. 10. Follow-up with your healthcare provider: Once you start taking antibiotics, your UTI symptoms should start improving within two to three days. However, if your symptoms worsen or do not improve, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider for further evaluation and management. Keep in mind that while these steps can help alleviate UTI symptoms, it's crucial to complete the antibiotic course as prescribed and maintain communication with your healthcare provider. UTIs left untreated or improperly treated can lead to more serious complications, including kidney infections and damage. It's also important to note that antibiotic-resistant UTIs are becoming increasingly common, so preventing UTIs through proper hygiene and self-care is essential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Piranha 3-D Movie plot: Fisherman Matt Boyd is fishing in Lake Victoria when a small earthquake hits, splitting the lake floor and causing a whirlpool. Boyd falls in, and is ripped apart by a shoal of piranhas that emerge from the chasm. Jake Forester is admiring attractive tourists as spring break begins. He reunites with his old crush Kelly Driscoll and meets Derrick Jones, a sleazy pornographer, as well as Danni Arslow, one of his actresses. Derrick convinces Jake to show him good spots on the lake for filming a pornographic movie. That night, Jake's mother, Sheriff Julie Forester, searches for the missing Matt Boyd with Deputy Fallon. They find his mutilated body and contemplate closing the lake. This decision, however, is made difficult as two-thousand partying college students are on spring break, which is important for bringing revenue to the small town. The next morning, a lone cliff diver is attacked and consumed by the vicious, marauding piranhas. Jake bribes his sister, Laura, and brother, Zane (Sage Ryan), to stay home alone so that he can show Derrick around the lake. After Jake leaves, Zane convinces Laura to go fishing on a small sandbar island. They forget to tie the boat down and are stranded in the middle of the lake. Meanwhile, Jake goes to meet with Derrick and runs into Kelly, who accepted Derrick's invitation on board his boat, The Barracuda. Jake meets Crystal Shepard, another one of Derrick's actresses, and cameraman Andrew Cunningham. Julie takes a team of seismologist diversâNovak Radzinsky, Sam Montez, and Paula Montellano to the fissure. Novak speculates that the rift leads to a buried prehistoric lake. Paula and Sam scuba dive to the bottom and discover a large cavern filled with large piranha egg stocks. Both are killed by the piranhas before they can alert the others to the discovery. Novak and Julie find Paula's corpse and pull it onto the boat, capturing a lone piranha, which they take to Carl Goodman, a marine biologist who works as a pet store owner.
