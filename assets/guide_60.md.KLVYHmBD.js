You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people. Do you have any questions?","completion":"The opening of IBM's new semiconductor factory in upstate New York, at a cost of over 2.5 billion, is a bold move by the company, especially given the current slowdown in the computer chip industry. This investment reflects IBM's confidence in its ability to remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor market and demonstrates their commitment to advancing research, design, and manufacturing in the field. The decision to locate the factory in New York, close to research facilities, underscores the importance of quickly integrating lab innovations into the production process. With IBM investing more than 500 million annually on semiconductor research and development, the company is looking to expand its reach beyond the realm of personal computer chips, where Intel and East Asian competitors have traditionally held an advantage. By focusing on producing specialized semiconductors for a range of applications, from mainframe computers to cell phones and video game consoles, IBM aims to target high-performance market segments. The factory's close proximity to its research laboratories in Westchester County, New York, will enable faster lab-to-fab integration, which, according to John Kelly, Senior Vice President in charge of IBM's technology group, is critical in maintaining a leading-edge approach to advanced chip technology. This strategic move is what led to the decision to build the factory in upstate New York rather than in Asia. With normal production expected to start early next year, the factory will provide employment opportunities for approximately 1,000 people. In summary, IBM's new semiconductor factory represents a significant investment in both advanced technology and the local economy. This move highlights the company's commitment to staying ahead in the constantly evolving and competitive global semiconductor industry, with particular emphasis on rapid integration of research advancements into their manufacturing processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sunlight Answer:","completion":"Title: The Celestial Fireworks Plot: In the year 2050, Earth has advanced its space technology to explore the depths of the universe. The International Space Agency (ISA) has discovered an extraordinary cosmic event— a comet nicknamed \\"Atlas\\", that only comes close to the Sun and Earth once every 1000 years, exhibiting mesmerizing out-gassing explosions when sunlight hits its surface. As the comet's approach nears, Dr. Evelyn Grant, a leading astrophysicist, notices anomalies in Atlas's trajectory and behavior. She shares her concerns with ISA's director, but her warnings are dismissed, maintaining that the comet will safely bypass Earth as predicted by scientists. Simultaneously, an alien vessel hiding behind the moon for centuries sends cryptic messages deciphered by Evelyn, revealing a prophecy of celestial fireworks that may threaten the existence of Earth itself. Determined to prove her theory, Evelyn secretly assembles a team of astronauts, including Capt. Mike Dawson, an experienced space pilot, and Dr. Kiera Takahashi, a genius in alien linguistics. They embark on a daring mission to intercept the comet and investigate its mysterious core before it reaches the point of no return. During their journey, Evelyn and Mike struggle with the emotional weight of leaving their families behind, while Kiera wrestles with the morality of revealing the alien prophecy's existence to the world. Upon reaching Atlas, the team is captivated by the stunning out-gassing explosions triggered by sunlight. Digging deeper into the comet's core, they unravel a hidden alien technology manipulating its trajectory slowly pushing it towards Earth. The aliens' motives are unclear, but the threat to humanity is imminent. As they race against time, the team works on multiple possible interventions: altering Atlas's trajectory, disabling the alien device, or even obliterating the comet itself. While Kiera deciphers the alien codes, Evelyn and Mike maneuver their ship, planting explosives to break Atlas into smaller, harmless fragments, in a risky, disruptive operation. In a heart-stopping climax, the team completes their mission just as the ISA director sends military forces to halt their unauthorized interference. The celestial fireworks caused by Atlas's explosion light up the sky in a breathtaking spectacle, symbolizing Earth's narrow escape from doom. The alien messages cease, leaving Earth's authorities questioning the true intention behind the extraterrestrial manipulation. In the aftermath, Evelyn, Mike, and Kiera are hailed as heroes. Through their courage and unwavering determination, they not only save Earth but also gain insight into a fascinating celestial phenomenon that brings a thrilling galactic experience to humanity. The Celestial Fireworks movie ends on a hopeful note, with a prospect of future alliances with other advanced civilizations, the mysterious aliens' true motives, and a newfound appreciation for Earth's fragile existence within the vast universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You're a product and you're selling a product.

Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \\"look\\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people.

Given the question: Yes. I had a stress heart attack five years ago. My step-son is a heroin addict. He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son’s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth. So, yep, I had a heart attack. I’m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I’m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse. I found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors. Since then I find I’m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband.

Step 1: Assuming that the cat is comfortable with the person, they would first softly speak to the cat to avoid startling it. This step is essential to ensure that the cat feels safe and at ease in the interaction. Step 2: Observing the cat's body language and reactions, the person would slowly move their hand closer to the cat's body. The reasoning behind this step is to not make any sudden movements that could scare or stress the cat. Step 3: The person starts petting the cat gently, beginning with the cat's head and moving along its back. This action is selected because most cats tend to enjoy being petted on these areas and it ensures that the person is approaching the interaction with respect for the cat's boundaries. Step 4: Throughout the petting session, the person should continuously observe the cat's body language for signs of unease or discomfort, such as flattened ears, twitching tail, or growling. This step is important to make sure the cat is still comfortable and to prevent any potential negative reactions like scratching or biting. Step 5: Depending on how receptive the cat is to the person's touch, the person may try petting other areas, such as the chin or behind the ears. This step is an optional exploration to see if the cat enjoys being petted at additional spots while still being cautious not to cross any boundaries. Step 6: The person will continue petting the cat until either the cat demonstrates that it wants the interaction to end (e.g., moving away or showing signs of discomfort) or the person decides to stop.

Trump said he did not make any promises to Carson about a future role in a potential Trump administration, but pledged that Carson would play a \\"big, big part\\" in his campaign. Carson -- whose campaign and demeanor were polar opposites of Trump's in many ways -- played the role Friday of vouching for Trump's character and integrity.

Chris Christie endorsed the businessman two weeks ago. Earlier this week, Carson had indicated that he would be open to backing either Trump or Ted Cruz. Carson and Cruz's relationship hit a rocky patch around the first GOP primary contest in Iowa, when the Cruz campaign incorrectly told precinct captains while the caucuses were taking place that Carson may be dropping out of the race. Carson called on Cruz to take responsibility and fire whoever was responsible for the \\"blatant lying,\\" and Cruz subsequently apologized. On Friday, Carson -- a Seventh Day Adventist -- insisted that he had no lingering hard feelings towards the Texas senator. \\"I have completely forgiven him. That's a duty one has as a Christian,\\" he said. On the tense exchanges that he has had with Trump this cycle, Carson said all of that was also history. \\"We moved on because it's not about me. It's not about Mr. Trump. This is about America.\\" Trump praised Carson throughout his press conference. \\"Having (Carson's) support, really, it just adds total credence to what I'm trying to do and to what we're all trying to do,\\" Trump said, introducing Carson. Trump says establishment is coming around Coming off of an unusually civil CNN Republican debate on Thursday night that lacked in personal insults and attacks, Trump exuded confidence about the trajectory of his campaign. Fielding questions from reporters for about 45 minutes, Trump said he is hopeful about clinching the nomination by getting 1,237 delegates and avoid a situation in which the nominee is chosen at the Republican convention over the summer. Looking ahead to next week, he predicted that he could defeat Ohio Gov. John Kasich in his home state. Trump suggested that establishment Republicans are beginning to rally around him in private conversations. He once again said he had a respectful conversation with House Speaker Paul Ryan this week, and though he declined to name names, he said he had heard from \\"virtually everybody in the Republican Party.\\" One person he has not had contact with: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Learn more ||||| Carson: 'There are two different Donald Trumps' The real estate mogul agrees with Carson, before quickly reversing himself. Ben Carson cracked open an awkward conversation for Donald Trump as he threw his backing behind his former rival and justified the move by saying, “There are two different Donald Trumps.” The real estate mogul, speaking at a news conference on Friday morning, conceded the point — “perhaps there are two Donald Trumps” — before reversing himself after reporters seized on the comment. “I don’t think there are two Donald Trumps.” Story Continued Below The surreal, extraordinary moment revealed Trump’s struggle as he gets closer to sewing up the Republican nomination and shifts to the general election — trying to broaden his appeal without alienating devoted supporters drawn to his theatrical style and hard-line views. Right off the bat, the retired neurosurgeon addressed the elephant in the room: the history of past insults and bad blood between himself and Trump. “Well, first of all, we buried the hatchet,\\" Carson said, referring to Trump’s accusation of Carson being a pathological liar who showed the same destructive tendencies as a child molester. \\"That was political stuff. And, you know, that happens in American politics, the politics of personal destruction. All that is not something that I particularly believe in or anything that I get involved in. But I do recognize that it is a part of the process. We move on because it’s not about me, it’s not about Mr. Trump. It’s about America.” Then Carson gave voice to what many have suspected — Trump the presidential candidate has so far largely been an act. Breaking down his logic for endorsing Trump, Carson remarked that there was \\"a lot more alignment philosophically and spiritually than I ever thought there was\\" between him and Trump. \\"First of all, I’ve come to know Donald Trump over the last few years. He’s actually a very intelligent man who cares deeply about America,\\" Carson said. \\"There are two different Donald Trumps. There’s the one you see on the stage and there’s the one who’s very cerebral, sits there and considers things very carefully. And Carson previewed Trump, the general election candidate, one who will be able to go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton, the policy wonk. “You can have a very good conversation with him, and that’s the Donald Trump that you’re going to see more and more of right now,” he said. Although the retired neurosurgeon had previewed the double Trump claim during a radio interview on Thursday, bringing up the split before a room full of reporters set off a chain reaction as the media nudged Trump to drop the mask, if there really is one. \\"Perhaps there are two Donald Trumps,\\" the real estate mogul said, when asked about Carson’s comment. \\"I’m somebody who is a thinker. I’m a big thinker. I have my ideas, and they’re strong, and typically they’ve worked out.” But when pressed further about why there are, in fact, \\"two Donald Trumps,\\" Trump abruptly reversed himself. \\"I don't think there's two Donald Trumps. I think there's one Donald Trump, but certainly, you have, look, all of this, and you have somebody else that sits and reads and thinks and I'm a thinker, and I have been a thinker. And perhaps people don't think of me that way because you don't see me in that forum, but I am a thinker,\\" he said. \\"I'm a very deep thinker. I know what's happening.\\" Trump, who was widely dismissed as an amusing sideshow when he made his rambling announcement speech in June, has evolved as he closes in on the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the GOP nomination. He has started moderating his views on torture, saying he would seek to change the laws instead of flouting international conventions, and has opened the door to negotiating on his far-right immigration stances. He’s also started staking out some new positions, saying at Thursday night’s debate that he would deploy as many as 30,000 American soldiers in the Middle East to defeat the Islamic State, and that he won’t rule out accepting outside contributions in the general election. But even as he shifts his gaze to the general election, he’s not dialed down the bombast that has lured millions of angry Americans he used to fondly call “the silent majority.” He’s under fresh fire for appearing to encourage violent clashes between his supporters and protesters at his rallies. And his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is fielding calls for him to resign after allegedly almost throwing a Breitbart reporter to the ground as she tried to ask Trump a question. Speaking at the news conference on Friday, Trump was eager to move past the armchair psychology. \\"I don't like to over-analyze myself, but I try to be who I am. Certain questions are asked to me, and I give a straight answer as opposed to a politically correct answer. I know the politically correct business better than anybody,\\" Trump said, then talking about his latest inflammatory comment that “Islam hates America.” And he focused on extolling the virtues of Carson, even as he reveled in how he ended up crushing him. Trump said he \\"actually gained a lot of respect\\" for the retired neurosurgeon through his \\"silence and strength\\" in facing off with his rhetorical broadsides. “I could not lose that guy,\\" Trump said, in discussing his respect for Carson as a candidate in the polls. \\"And I was doing well and you know, Trump would be at 28 at that time, and I remember when it was 28 and Ben was 18, and then he was 19, and the next week it was like 22, and I was like, 'Whoa, whoa, what's this happening here? I don't like this.' Right?\\" Trump said, turning to Carson. Carson flashed a quick, congenial grin. Referring to an early November poll that showed Carson with a 6-point lead on him, Trump declared, \\"It was the biggest story worldwide. I said, this guy is unbelievable. And so, I started going after Ben. It's politics, and Ben understands that.\\" He went on to brag about a list of unscientific online polls, showing him as the winner of Thursday night’s debate, before saying it’s time to move on. \\"We've had enough debates, in my opinion. These debates have been like, Vince McMahon should have put them on, because they were like WWE,\\" said Trump, who himself appeared at WWE's WrestleMania in 2007. Carson also laid out his argument for the party and country to unify around Trump as the nominee and president — warning Trump's opponents not to try to mess with him. \\"I want the voice of the people to be heard. I want the political process to play out in the way that it should play out, and I think the Republican Party particularly would be very wise not to adopt, let’s stop this guy and let’s promote this guy's policy, but rather start thinking about what are the things that are going to be helpful in America,\\" Carson said. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Ben Carson is a retired doctor who wanted to be the president of the United States.

Select from the following. (i) If they're fabric, wash in the washer with other winter gear on gentle with cold water. (ii) If they're fabric, wash in the washer with other winter gear on heavily soiled with hot water.","completion":"Cleaning your winter gloves requires careful consideration of their fabric and manufacturer's instructions to maintain their quality and functionality. To make the right decision, assess the type of material and the level of soiling on your gloves before choosing between the two available options: Option (i): If your winter gloves are made of fabric and are not heavily soiled, it is advisable to wash them in the washer with other winter gear on gentle with cold water. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to clean your fabric gloves using this method: 1. Check the care label: To maintain the integrity of your winter gloves, always follow the manufacturer's care label instructions regarding water temperature, cycle settings, and recommended detergents. 2. Pre-treat stains: Gently rub a stain remover on any visibly dirty areas or spots before putting your gloves in the washing machine. 3. Use a gentle detergent: Choose a mild detergent that is suitable for delicate fabrics. Harsh detergents may damage the fabric or compromise the gloves' insulation properties and waterproof features. 4. Choose the right cycle: Set your washing machine to a gentle cycle with cold water. It's essential to use cold water to avoid any damage or shrinkage to your gloves and winter gear. 5. Add additional protection: To secure the gloves during the wash cycle, place them in a mesh laundry bag. This will prevent them from getting tangled with other items or damaged inside the drum. 6. Wash with similar items: Combine the gloves with other winter gear made from similar materials and colors to maximize the washing machine's efficiency while protecting the gloves from harsher treatment. 7. Air-dry your gloves: Do not use a dryer to dry your winter gloves. Instead, let them air-dry by laying them flat in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. This will help retain their shape and prevent damage to the fabric. Option (ii): If your winter gloves are fabric and heavily soiled, washing them in the washer with other winter gear on heavily soiled with hot water can help remove tough stains. However, be cautious with this option. Hot water may cause damage or shrinkage to the gloves, especially if they are made from natural fibers like wool. Check the care label instructions first for any specific guidance on water temperature or cycle settings. If it allows washing in hot water for heavily soiled items, proceed with the following steps: 1. Check the care label: Follow the care label instructions for temperature adjustment, cycle settings, and detergent recommendations. 2. Pre-treat stains: Apply a stain remover on stubborn stains and allow it to sit for a few minutes before placing them in the washer. 3. Use appropriate detergent: Select a detergent that is effective on heavily soiled garments while still being suitable for the fabric type of your gloves. 4. Choose the right cycle: Set your washing machine to a heavily soiled cycle with hot water, ensuring that the temperature complies with the care label's guidance. 5. Add additional protection: Place your heavily soiled gloves in a mesh laundry bag for protection during the wash cycle. 6. Wash with similar items: Combine the gloves with other heavily soiled winter gear made from similar materials and colors. 7. Air-dry your gloves: Always air-dry your winter gloves by laying them flat in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. In conclusion, the appropriate method for cleaning your winter gloves depends on their fabric and level of soiling. Always prioritize following the manufacturer's care instructions and opt for a milder approach (gentle cycle with cold water) whenever possible. Only use the heavily soiled cycle with hot water if the care label explicitly allows it and if your gloves are excessively dirty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: Spend some time looking at different Etsy sellers, especially successful ones, to find your niche in the market. Think about how your artwork can stand out from the crowd. Consider how your work is different and how you can bring a unique perspective to what is already selling on Etsy. For example, you may use the Etsy search bar to look up sellers who are making artwork that is similar to yours. You may notice what types of artwork they sell as well as their price points and their type of clientele. Consider the age group and demographic you want to sell to. Are you trying to make artwork for a younger audience, such as children? Do you want to make artwork for an older audience, such as individuals looking for artwork for their homes or offices? Think about how you can appeal to a specific customer or niche on Etsy. For example, you may try doing animal portraits in cross stitch, rather than paint animal portraits, as these are already popular on Etsy. Or you may create custom abstract art for interiors in interesting materials like spray paint and fabric to stand out. For your artwork to be sold on Etsy, it must be handmade and/or designed by you. If you have a design partner, you must disclose this on your shop. You will also need to disclose every person involved in the making of the item. You cannot resell items that were not handmade or designed by you. You must be honest and forthcoming in your descriptions of items and in the information you provide about your shop. Appeal to a variety of shoppers by carrying artwork that ranges in price. Try to have artwork that is on the more affordable side and on the more expensive side. Giving variety can open up your shop to a wide range of buyers and encourage your customers return to buy more. Etsy finds that items 50 USD and under tend to be the most popular. You may use 50 USD as your base price and price your items up or down from there. For example, you may have several pieces that are in the 50-100 USD range or in the 0-50 USD range. You may then offer a few larger or more detailed pieces in the 100-200 USD range. Do not be afraid to offer artwork that is more expensive, as some art buyers are drawn to more expensive work that is original and one of a kind. Summary:","completion":"To succeed on Etsy, research successful sellers and find your niche in the market.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: How to prove similar triangles<br>Define the angle-angle (aa) theorem. Two triangles can be proved similar by the angle-angle theorem which states: if two triangles have two congruent angles, then those triangles are similar. [substeps] This theorem is also called the angle-angle-angle (aaa) theorem because if two angles of the triangle are congruent, the third angle must also be congruent. Hypothesis: There is an exact way to prove similar triangles","completion":"After reading the provided paragraph and analyzing the information given, we can conclude that the hypothesis stating \\"There is an exact way to prove similar triangles\\" is true. The Angle-Angle (AA) Theorem, as detailed in the paragraph, provides a clear and exact method for proving the similarity of two triangles. Let's further elaborate on the AA (or AAA) Theorem and its application in proving triangle similarity: According to the Angle-Angle Theorem, two triangles are considered similar if they have two congruent (equal) angles. It is important to note that in a triangle, the sum of the internal angles always adds up to 180 degrees. Therefore, when two angles of a triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, it inherently implies that their third angles are also congruent. This is why the theorem is also referred to as the Angle-Angle-Angle (AAA) Theorem. To apply the AA Theorem in proving the similarity of two triangles, follow these steps: 1. Identify the corresponding angles: For two triangles to be similar, their corresponding angles must be equal. So the first step is to identify which angles correspond between the two triangles. 2. Check for congruence of at least two pairs of corresponding angles: Once you've identified the corresponding angles, check whether at least two pairs of these angles are congruent. If their measures are equal, then the two pairs of angles are congruent. 3. Determine the similarity of the triangles: If at least two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent, then by the AA Theorem, the two triangles are proven to be similar. The AA Theorem's ability to prove the similarity of triangles is a direct result of the properties of triangles, particularly the fact that the sum of their internal angles is always equal to 180 degrees. This requirement for triangles ensures that, whenever two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent, their third pair will also be congruent, thereby satisfying the necessary conditions for similarity. In conclusion, the hypothesis is true, and there is indeed an exact way to prove similar triangles, which is through the Angle-Angle (AA) Theorem. This theorem provides a systematic and precise approach to determining triangle similarity by focusing on the congruence of their corresponding angles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Sometimes you need to make phone calls to get a job. Calling is the first step where you can show your ability to an employer. Here are some tried and true tips: Get the person responsible You need to talk directly to the person who would supervise you. In a small business, you might ask to speak to the \\"person in charge\\". In a larger one, you would ask for the name of the person in charge of the particular department you're interested in. Get the name of the person If you don't have the name of the person you need to speak to, ask for it. Usually, you will be given the supervisor's name and your call will be transferred to him or her. Get past the receptionist In some cases, receptionists and secretaries will try to screen out your call. If they find out that you're looking for a job, they may transfer you to the Personnel Department or ask you to send an application or resume. Here are some ways to keep from getting screened out: * Call back Call back a day later and say you are getting ready to send some correspondence to the person who manages such and such. You want to use the correct name and title and request that they give you this information. And this approach usually gets you what you need. Say \\"thank you\\" and call back in a day or so. Then ask for the supervisor or manager by name. * Call when the secretary is out You are likely to get right through if you call when the receptionist is out to lunch. Other good times are just before and after normal work hours. Less experienced staff members are likely to answer the phone and put you right through. Ask three times for an interview Sometimes, the supervisor you contact just simply rejects you. Then, you can try asking three times for an interview! Although this approach does not always work, asking the third time works more often than most people would believe. Arrange a time If the person agrees to an interview, arrange a specific date and time. Question: In the writer's opinion, who should you talk to if you want to get a job by making phone calls?

The seductive sheen, the rumble, the combustive power of automobiles called to him like a siren at sea. He coveted the sense of possibility inherent in the turn of a key. And the MG-TD held a place high in his list of hope. British Racing Green, wood dashboard and a four-stroke engine. He had only seen one MG-TD, when he'd gone on holiday with his folks to the U.K. They had been walking down the street in downtown London. Most of the traffic had been pedestrian or cyclist. The occasional fuel-cell car glided by like a ghostly leftover from the Vehicular Age. Double-decker biodiesel buses roared past regularly, trailing the odor of fish and chips after them. And then it came down the street toward them. A car that purred as its rounded lines soaked up the sun with a green so deep it was almost black. It pulled into the valet parking of a grand hotel and two people got out. Aage barely noticed them. He stared inside the car, where chrome and brass gleamed against a burled wood dashboard. The doors of the car shut with the heavy thunk of real metal. A valet pulled the car out of the parking circle and Aage never saw it again. After the end of this story, Aage is experiencing: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Longing - not enough information - The security of having enough funds to afford multiple cars - The joy of driving his new car A:","completion":"Aage is experiencing longing. The vivid recollection of the 1952 MG-TD he saw during his holiday in the UK has left a lasting impression on him. The description of the car's purr, its deep green color, and the burled wood dashboard highlights the fascination he has for the Vehicular Age. Aage's yearning for this particular car is so strong that he tries to convince his mother to help him buy one, despite her concerns about the co-op members and him not being able to afford it. Aage's longing is further emphasized by his inability to understand or explain his fascination with automobiles from the Vehicular Age to his mother. The seductive sheen, rumble, and combustive power of these cars captivate him, and they call to him like a siren at sea. This demonstrates how deeply his longing runs, as it's compared to a mythical force that will not let go. Additionally, the mention of his encounter with the MG-TD in London showcases the sense of possibility inherent in the turn of a key. This desire for freedom and control is a strong driving force behind his longing for the car. The moment when the valet drives away with the car he admires, leaving Aage with a lasting memory and an even stronger desire to own one, further intensifies his yearning. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question of what Aage is experiencing after the end of this story is a profound longing. His fascination with the Vehicular Age, coupled with the unforgettable memory of the MG-TD, drives his desire to own this classic car, even when faced with the reality of not being able to afford it and not having the support of his mother. His longing permeates his thoughts and emotions, just like the deep green color of the British Racing MG-TD."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

According to Sentence 1, 5 million green-card holders living in the United States in 1996 were eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship. This means that those individuals who possessed a green card, which is essentially a permit allowing a foreign national to live and work in the United States permanently, were allowed to apply for U.S. citizenship. U.S. citizenship would grant them numerous rights and benefits, including the right to vote, run for public office, and access better job opportunities.

On the other hand, Sentence 2 states that nobody in 1996 was allowed to apply for U.S. citizenship. This sentence contradicts the information presented in Sentence 1, as it denies the possibility for any individuals, including the 5 million green-card holders mentioned in Sentence 1, to apply for citizenship. Given this contradiction, it's evident that Sentence 2 is not entailed by Sentence 1, and the two statements cannot both be accurate portrayals of the situation in 1996.

A:","completion":"A: The last step of the process involves the release of newly produced virus particles from the host cell, which subsequently infect neighboring cells and continue the cycle of viral replication. This release can happen through two main mechanisms: 1. Budding: In this process, new virus particles become enveloped in a portion of the host cell's membrane. As they push against the cell membrane, they eventually bud off from the surface of the host cell, acquiring an outer layer made from the host cell's lipids. Afterward, the newly generated virus particles are ready to infect other cells. 2. Lysis: In this process, the large number of replicated virus particles accumulate within the host cell, causing it to swell and ultimately rupture or lyse. This cell lysis releases the newly produced virus particles into the extracellular environment, where they can infect nearby cells and continue the viral replication process. Following the release of new virus particles, the host cell usually dies, which can cause damage and inflammation to the surrounding tissue. This leads to the symptoms associated with viral infections, such as fever, cough, and other flu-like symptoms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Nature is full of color, from rainbows and roses to butterfly wings and peacock tails. Even the fruits and vegetables you eat have different colors: blue blueberries, red strawberries, green broccoli, and orange carrots. Plant and animals often use color to attract attention. The substances responsible for these colors belong to a class of chemical called antioxidants . Plants make antioxidant to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet(UV) light. Ultraviolet light causes chemicals called free radicals to form within plant cells. They can destroy parts of plant. Free radicals also have damaging effects on human beings. Some of these effects like wrinkled skin can be seen. The damage is caused by the free radicals attacking cells in our bodies. Certain cancers and heart disease are linked to free radicals. Our bodies have natural defences for fighting off free radicals. While we are young, our defences are pretty strong. However, they get weaker as we get older. The body's built-in defences can only go so far without extra help. The key to fighting free radicals with fruits and vegetables is to mix and match colors. It's like sunscreen for the inside of your body. Go for a range of very bright colors. Colorful foods contain hundreds of healthy chemicals not found anywhere else. Research into how chemicals in blueberries affect the brain's function in rats suggests that these chemicals may help our own brains work more efficiently. Don't just blame the sun.

They are part of Aphrodite's retinue. \\"Erotes\\" (Greek ) is the plural of \\"Eros\\" (\\"Love, Desire\\"), who as a singular deity has a more complex mythology. - Psychoanalytic theory is the theory of personality organization and the dynamics of personality development that guides psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology. First laid out by Sigmund Freud in the late 19th century, psychoanalytic theory has undergone many refinements since his work. Psychoanalytic theory came to full prominence in the last third of the twentieth century as part of the flow of critical discourse regarding psychological treatments after the 1960s, long after Freud's death in 1939, and its validity is now widely disputed or rejected. Freud had ceased his analysis of the brain and his physiological studies and shifted his focus to the study of the mind and the related psychological attributes making up the mind, and on treatment using free association and the phenomena of transference. His study emphasized the recognition of childhood events that could influence the mental functioning of adults. His examination of the genetic and then the developmental aspects gave the psychoanalytic theory its characteristics. Starting with his publication of \\"The Interpretation of Dreams\\" in 1899, his theories began to gain prominence. - Psychopathology is the scientific study of mental disorders, including efforts to understand their genetic, biological, psychological, and social causes; effective classification schemes (nosology); course across all stages of development; manifestations; and treatment. The term may also refer to the manifestation of behaviors that indicate the presence of a mental disorder. - Sigmund Freud ( born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938 Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939. - Aphrodite (; Greek: (\\"Afrodíti\\")) is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. She is identified with the planet Venus, and her Roman equivalent is the goddess . - In classical mythology, Cupid (Latin Cupido, meaning \\"desire\\") is the god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affection. He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess Venus and the war god Mars, and is known in Latin also as \\"Amor\\" (\\"Love\\"). His Greek counterpart is Eros. - Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. In men, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is essential for health and well-being, and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss. - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. - The University of Vienna is a public university located in Vienna, Austria. It was founded by Duke Rudolph IV in 1365 and is one of the oldest universities in the German-speaking world. With its long and rich history, the University of Vienna has developed into one of the biggest universities in Europe, and also one of the most renowned, especially in the Humanities. It is associated with 15 Nobel prize winners and has been the academic home of a large number of figures both of historical and academic importance. - Psychoanalysis is a set of theories and therapeutic techniques related to the study of the unconscious mind, which together form a method of treatment for mental-health disorders. The discipline was established in the early 1890s by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and stemmed partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others. - In Greek mythology, Thanatos ([] \\"Death\\", from \\"thnsk\\" \\"to die, be dying\\") was the personification of death. He was a minor figure in Greek mythology, often referred to, but rarely appearing in person. - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. - Beyond the Pleasure Principle ( German : Jenseits des Lustprinzips ) is a 1920 essay by Sigmund Freud that marks a major turning point in his theoretical approach . Previously , Freud attributed most human behavior to the sexual instinct ( Eros or libido ) . With this essay , Freud went \`\` beyond '' the simple pleasure principle , developing his theory of drives with the addition of the death drive ( s ) ( Todestrieb ( e ) ) ( often referred to as \`\` Thanatos '' ) . - Hypersexuality is a clinical diagnosis used by mental healthcare researchers and providers to describe extremely frequent or suddenly increased sexual urges or sexual activity. The terms nymphomania and satyriasis were once used to describe the condition, in women and men respectively, but are no longer in general medical use, although the former is still used colloquially. - Moravia is a historical country in the Czech Republic (forming its eastern part) and one of the historical Czech lands, together with Bohemia and Czech Silesia. The medieval and early modern Margraviate of Moravia was a crown land of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (from 1348 to 1918), an imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire (1004 to 1806), later a crown land of the Austrian Empire (1804 to 1867) and briefly also one of 17 former crown lands of the Cisleithanian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867 to 1918. During the early 20th century, Moravia was one of the five lands of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1928; it was then merged with Czech Silesia, and eventually dissolved by abolition of the land system in 1949. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - In Greek mythology, Eros (or , \\"Desire\\") was the Greek god of love. His Roman counterpart was Cupid (\\"desire\\"). Some myths make him a primordial god, while in other myths, he is the son of Aphrodite. He was one of the winged love gods, Erotes. - Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growthheight and weightaccelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs. - In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the death drive is the drive towards death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by Sabina Spielrein in her paper \\"Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being\\" (\\"\\"Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens\\"\\") which was then taken up by Sigmund Freud in 1920 in \\"Beyond the Pleasure Principle.\\" This concept has been translated as, \\"opposition between the ego or death instincts and the sexual or life instincts\\". In \\"Pleasure Principle\\", Freud used the plural \\"death drives\\" (\\"Todestriebe\\") much more frequently than in the singular. - Neuropathology is the study of disease of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either small surgical biopsies or whole-body autopsies. Neuropathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology, neurology, and neurosurgery. It should not be confused with neuropathy, which refers to disorders of the nerves themselves (usually in the peripheral nervous system). - Libido, colloquially known as sex drive, is a person's overall sexual drive or desire for sexual activity. Sex drive is influenced by biological, psychological and social factors. Biologically, the sex hormones and associated neurotransmitters that act upon the nucleus accumbens (primarily testosterone and dopamine, respectively) regulate libido in humans. Social factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, like personality and stress, can affect libido. Sex drive can also be affected by medical conditions, medications, lifestyle and relationship issues, and age (e.g., puberty). A person who has extremely frequent or a suddenly increased sex drive may be experiencing hypersexuality, while the opposite condition is hyposexuality. - Instinct or innate behavior is the inherent inclination of a living organism towards a particular complex behavior. The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a fixed action pattern (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a clearly defined stimulus.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"In order to analyze whether the hypothesis \\"We are highly honoured\\" is entailed by the premise \\"We are greatly honoured,\\" we need to first understand the meanings of the words \\"greatly\\" and \\"highly\\" and how they relate to the context of honour. Additionally, we should consider the principles of entailment and how they apply in this particular case. Entailment, in the context of logic and reasoning, is a relationship between two statements where the truth of one statement necessarily implies the truth of another. More specifically, if one statement entails another, it means that whenever the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true. Now, let's examine the words \\"greatly\\" and \\"highly.\\" Both are adverbs that are often used to modify adjectives or other adverbs, and they both convey the idea of \\"to a great extent\\" or \\"to a high degree.\\" In the given context of honour, we can understand them as referring to a level of respect, admiration, or appreciation. \\"Greatly\\" is defined as: 1. To an extent that is much above the normal or average level. 2. To a very high degree or intensity. \\"Highly\\" is defined as: 1. To a high degree, notably above the average. 2. At or to a large extent, in a high quantity, or with great intensity. Considering these definitions, it's clear that both \\"greatly\\" and \\"highly\\" convey a sense of being above average or normal levels when it comes to the concept of honour. Now, let's return to the question of whether the hypothesis \\"We are highly honoured\\" is entailed by the premise \\"We are greatly honoured.\\" Given that both \\"greatly\\" and \\"highly\\" point to a level of honour above the average or normal, the two can be reasonably considered to be equivalent in meaning. This equivalence in meaning suggests that the truth of the premise does, in fact, imply the truth of the hypothesis. If \\"we are greatly honoured\\" is true, then it follows that \\"we are highly honoured\\" must also be true. Therefore, based on the analysis and definitions provided, it can be concluded that the hypothesis \\"We are highly honoured\\" is entailed by the premise \\"We are greatly honoured.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Block a nerve. In this sentence, \\"block\\" seems to be related to a physical or medical process, possibly interrupting the function of a nerve in the body. Sentence 2: You are blocking the name of your first wife! Here, \\"blocking\\" seems to refer to someone forgetting or repressing a memory, specifically the name of their first wife. This is a more metaphorical usage of the word. Step 2: Compare meanings Now I will compare the meanings to determine if they are the same or different. In the first sentence, \\"block\\" refers to a physical or medical action that impacts the function of a nerve. In the second sentence, \\"block\\" refers to the act of forgetting or repressing a memory. While both uses involve hindering or stopping something, the context and the objects being blocked are different.

The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

Derrick said socks would help because","completion":"At night, Craig always got cold feet. Derrick said socks would help because they serve as an additional layer of insulation that traps and retains the body's natural warmth, keeping the feet cozy and comfortable throughout the night. Socks, especially those made from materials like wool, cotton, or fleece, possess excellent thermal properties ideal for maintaining warmth. These materials provide insulation by using the tiny air pockets within their fabric fibers to catch and hold body heat. The trapped air then forms a buffer between the skin and the cooler ambient/environmental temperature, which substantially slows down the heat loss process. Consequently, Craig's feet will be able to remain at a more comfortable and constant temperature, preventing him from experiencing the unpleasant sensation of cold feet during the night. Moreover, socks also prevent heat escape by minimizing direct contact between the feet and cold surfaces, such as hardwood floors or chilly bed sheets. This protective barrier helps to shield the feet from heat-conductive materials notorious for absorbing and conducting heat away from the body, thereby leaving the feet colder. Additionally, socks aid in regulating the body's moisture levels, contributing to better overall thermal comfort. When feet become clammy from perspiration, the moisture can feel chilly and uncomfortable. Socks made from moisture-wicking materials, like merino wool, can effectively absorb and transport dampness away from the skin, keeping Craig's feet dry and warm. Since good blood circulation is crucial for maintaining warmth, wearing proper-fitting socks can contribute to an easier flow of blood to the extremities. By preventing tight elastic bands that may constrict blood flow, the right size of socks allows blood to circulate freely, ensuring that vital nutrients and oxygen reach the feet while also transporting heat effectively. As a result, Craig's feet will be healthier and naturally warmer. Furthermore, doubling up on socks, layering, or using heated or thermal socks can provide even greater benefits for individuals like Craig who are prone to cold feet. These specialized socks contain insulating layers, additional padding, or self-heating properties to maximize warmth retention, making them perfect for unusually cold nights or for those who suffer from chronically cold feet. In conclusion, Derrick's suggestion that socks would help alleviate Craig's cold feet at night is well-founded. By providing insulation, preventing heat escape, regulating moisture, and promoting proper blood circulation, socks deliver essential warmth retention and overall foot comfort. To further enhance these benefits, selecting the appropriate sock materials, fitting, and styles is crucial for ensuring that Craig enjoys cozy, warm feet throughout the night."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unlike the other colonists, who eventually melted into the culture, the Cajuns kept to themselves in the bayou, retaining their 17th-century language and customs. Does it follow that \\"Less than half of the colonists did not melt into the culture just like the Cajuns that kept to themselves in the bayou.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"Less than half of the colonists did not melt into the culture just like the Cajuns that kept to themselves in the bayou\\" might not be entirely correct without additional context about the population and cultural trends of colonists. The original statement focuses solely on the characteristics and distinctiveness of the Cajun community in relation to other colonists. To determine if \\"less than half of the colonists\\" did not integrate into the broader culture, it is essential to examine other colonial communities and their respective levels of cultural assimilation. The Cajuns are a unique group that originated from the Acadian settlers, who were expelled from eastern Canada by the British during the Great Upheaval in the mid-1700s. Thousands of Acadians relocated to southern Louisiana, where the environment and remote location of the bayous enabled them to preserve their cultural identity and traditions, including their language, customs, and way of life. That being said, it is important to note that colonial America was home to various groups of people originating from different countries, each with its own customs and values. As these communities came together, they were faced with the need to adapt and assimilate in order to coexist alongside one another. Some chose to melt into the broader culture by adopting new traditions, lifestyles, and even languages, while others, like the Cajuns, managed to maintain their unique identity. Therefore, to accurately assess whether \\"less than half of the colonists\\" maintained their distinctiveness and did not melt into the broader culture, we need more information and context about the other colonial communities. Factors such as geographical proximity, population size, political and social encounters, and the level of interaction with other communities would need to be considered. For instance, if most other communities assimilated successfully, then the given statement would not be accurate. However, if there were multiple pockets of colonists across America that retained their original culture like the Cajuns, then the statement could hold true. In conclusion, while it is clear that the Cajuns stand out as a group that preserved their unique language and customs, making an assertion about the cultural assimilation of less than half of all colonists requires a broader understanding of other colonial communities and their respective levels of integration within the broader culture."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Capacitors may retain a charge long after power is removed from a circuit; this charge can cause dangerous or even potentially fatal shocks or damage connected equipment. For example, even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposable-camera flash unit, powered by a 1.5 volt AA battery, has a capacitor which may contain over 15 joules of energy and be charged to over 300 volts. This is easily capable of delivering a shock. Service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or high-voltage capacitors, for instance using a Brinkley stick. Capacitors may also have built-in discharge resistors to dissipate stored energy to a safe level within a few seconds after power is removed.

The verb \\"raise\\" typically means to lift or elevate something to a higher position or level, and in these specific contexts, it refers to articulating or amplifying a particular sound. In both cases, the speaker is asked to increase the volume and expressiveness of their voice by either a shout or a sad cry.

Now more than 10% of net users are visiting websites using the new system, statistics suggest. Called IPv6, the protocol replaces an the older version whose pool of addresses is almost depleted. The figures were gathered by search giant Google, which monitors how people reach its services. The adoption of IPv6 around the world is patchy, as some nations have deployed it widely while others have ignored it. Belgium tops the table of most enthusiastic IPv6 adopters, as 44.3% of people in that country can use it to get at Google and other IPv6 sites. Adoption in the US is 25.6% and the UK 2.95%. The net has grown largely on the back of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), which can support a total of four billion addresses. But the massive growth of the net has meant almost all of these older identifiers have now been used up. Everything connected to the net needs an address to ensure that data reaches the right destination. The basic syntax of Internet Protocol version 6 was first agreed 20 years ago, but only in December 2015 did use of it hit 10%, according to Google's figures. Adrian Kennard, head of ISP Andrews and Arnold, said now that IPv4 had run out, many people were taking IPv6 a lot more seriously. \\"Major sites such as Facebook and Google have adopted IPv6, and pretty much any web site could be using IPv6 now,\\" he told the BBC. \\"This means that people that have IPv6 on their devices, as well as IPv4, can now use IPv6 in preference.\\" Mobile networks are among the biggest users of IPv6, because most modern smartphones are equipped for it. The vast majority of people online still connect via IPv4, and some ISPs use technology in their networks to translate between the two. Some are pushing on with projects to convert their networks to IPv6 - in the UK, BT has said its entire network will be able to use IPv6 by the end of 2016. Running both IPv4 and IPv6 had its problems, said Mr Kennard, though few noticed it as the basic tasks of visiting websites were rarely affected by the internal technology. \\"However, sharing IPv4 addresses does stifle innovation and development of new applications and protocols,\\" he said. \\"Eventually IPv4 will be some obscure legacy thing, still lingering on a bit,\\" he added. \\"Sadly, we are probably many years away from that.\\"","completion":"The novel scheme being mentioned refers to IPv6 protocol which is designed to help the internet support more users and an increased selection of smart devices and gadgets. This initiative comes as an attempt to counter the depletion of the older protocol, IPv4, which has nearly run out of addresses. According to research data gathered by Google, more than 10% of internet users are now visiting websites using the IPv6 system. IPv6, or Internet Protocol version 6, serves as a replacement for the older IPv4, or Internet Protocol version 4. The primary difference between the two is their capacity for network addresses. IPv4 can support a total of four billion addresses, which may seem vast, but due to the exponential growth of internet use, these addresses are almost entirely occupied. As the internet continues to expand, as does the demand for devices and gadgets connected to the internet. With every device requiring an address to ensure the data it sends or receives gets to the correct destination, a need for a more robust protocol is evident. In December 2015, twenty years after its basic syntax was first agreed upon, usage of IPv6 reached 10% according to Google. This adoption has been patchy with some countries fully embracing it while others have yet to recognize its utility. Belgium notably leads in adoption with approximately 44.3% of its inhabitants capable of using IPv6 to access Google and other IPv6 supported sites. The US follows with a 25.6% adoption rate and the UK trails at 2.95%. In a quote from Adrian Kennard, head of ISP Andrews and Arnold, he notes the increased seriousness with which IPv6 is being taken now that IPv4 addresses have run out. He celebrates the adoption of IPv6 by major sites like Facebook and Google and acknowledges that virtually any website could be using IPv6 at this point. This shift allows individuals with IPv6 on their devices to preferentially use it over IPv4 when connecting to the internet. He also points out that mobile networks are among the largest user groups of IPv6 due to the equipping of modern smartphones for the protocol. Nevertheless, despite the shifting trend, a large portion of individuals online still connect via IPv4. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use technology in their networks to translate between the outdated IPv4 and the newer IPv6. Prioritizing projects to convert networks to IPv6 is ongoing, as demonstrated by BT in the UK which announced an intention for its entire network to use IPv6 by the end of 2016. Running both IPv4 and IPv6 concurrently has its disadvantages as noted by Mr. Kennard, as the sharing of IPv4 addresses hinders the innovation and development of new applications and protocols. Nevertheless, this is often unnoticed by the majority of users as it rarely impacts the basic tasks such as website visits. According to Kennard, eventually, IPv4 will become a \\"lingering\\" obscure legacy, although he concedes that this is likely many years away."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: 13, ['T', '5709', '601', '6335', '8001', 'W', '311', '1535', '211', '5919', '9877', 'H', 'D', 'C', '4229', '6839', 'i', 's', '9665', '3917', 'I', 'T', '2313', 'y', 'N', 'x', 'Z', 'z', 'n', '8973'] Output:","completion":"In this task, you are asked to find the elements that come after the first 'i' elements in a given list 'A'. The input consists of an integer 'i' and a list 'A'. The output will be a new list containing the elements of 'A' after the first 'i' elements. Here are the simple steps to achieve this task: 1. Understand the input provided: Input: i = 13, A = ['T', '5709', '601', '6335', '8001', 'W', '311', '1535', '211', '5919', '9877', 'H', 'D', 'C', '4229', '6839', 'i', 's', '9665', '3917', 'I', 'T', '2313', 'y', 'N', 'x', 'Z', 'z', 'n', '8973'] 2. Based on the input, we know that i = 13, which means we need to find the elements of 'A' after the first 13 elements. 3. To do this, you can use slicing to get the elements of 'A' starting from the index 'i' to the end of the list. 4. Following the steps: - Slice the list 'A' starting from index 'i' (13 in this case) - A[i:] will give us the elements in the list 'A' after the first 13 elements 5. The output can be obtained as follows: Output: ['C', '4229', '6839', 'i', 's', '9665', '3917', 'I', 'T', '2313', 'y', 'N', 'x', 'Z', 'z', 'n', '8973'] By following these simple steps, you can find the elements of list 'A' after the first 'i' elements."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The cast of this movie plays their characters to the 'T' (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a Ben Stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed).

Edna declines to hire him but offers him a meal instead and sends him on his way. In desperation, Moses steals some of her silver spoons before he leaves. Similarly desperate, Edna finally resolves to keep her family together on the farm no matter what. When the police capture Moseswith her stolen silver, and bring him back to confirm the theft, Edna seizes the opportunity. She lies to the police and says he is her hired man.

As someone who works at the court, Benjamin was highly familiar with the legal system and was aware of the various intricacies associated with representing oneself in a civil lawsuit. He recognized the importance of having a thorough understanding of the court's rules, procedures, and required etiquette for someone in Leslie's position. To begin with, Benjamin provided Leslie with a detailed overview of the court's expectations regarding decorum and proper conduct during the trial. He emphasized the need for punctuality, proper attire, and maintaining a respectful demeanor throughout the proceedings. Benjamin also explained the importance of addressing the judge as 'Your Honor' and standing up when addressing the court or responding to questions. Moving on to the procedural aspects, Benjamin outlined the various stages of a civil trial. He explained the process of filing a complaint, serving it on the defendant, and waiting for the defendant to submit their answer. He also described how the parties would exchange information through the process of discovery, including interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. Drawing further on his experience, Benjamin shared valuable insights related to the pre-trial phase. He advised Leslie on the necessity of filing pre-trial motions, which could help streamline the proceedings and potentially lead to a favorable outcome. Motions such as summary judgment, requesting a change of venue, or even asking the court to dismiss the case entirely were all strategies that Leslie needed to keep in mind. With regards to presenting evidence during the trial, Benjamin highlighted that Leslie should be prepared to submit witness testimonies, documents, and other relevant evidence to effectively support his case.

Finally, Benjamin touched upon essential post-trial matters, such as filing an appeal if the outcome was unfavorable or collecting the judgment in the event of success. He explained that understanding the appellate process and the grounds for filing an appeal was crucial, as even the smallest error in procedure could potentially nullify the results of a hard-won trial.

Given those answer options, answer the question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

She was unbelievably grateful to have the annoying man out of her life for good Answer the following question: Why did the speaker cry when the man boarded the plane and left for Oregon ?","completion":"The speaker cried when the man boarded the plane and left for Oregon primarily because of the complex emotions she was experiencing at that moment. She did not want him to go and felt torn apart between sadness and hope for the future, which in turn caused her to shed tears. On one hand, the speaker was upset because she had deep feelings for the man and desired to become his girlfriend and potentially his wife. His departure meant that they would be geographically separated, which undoubtedly would impact their relationship. The physical distance can create emotional distance, leaving the speaker feeling uncertain and anxious about the future of their connection. On the other hand, the man had given her hope by promising her a chance to be with him, which she desired the most. This promise represented a glimmer of hope for their relationship despite the physical separation. It is this hope that made her feel torn as she felt that their love story might still have a chance to blossom. These tears, therefore, were a culmination of sadness, hope, and anxiety that the speaker experienced while the man she cared for deeply was leaving for Oregon. Her heartache was magnified when it turned out that upon arriving in Oregon, instead of keeping his promise to her, the man got back together with his previous girlfriend. This betrayal added another level of pain to her tears, as she felt devalued and pushed away by someone she deeply cared for."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: John lives in a farhouse well away from anyone.

Blood pressure is vital to push blood through the nephrons effectively. Step 3: The kidneys filter the waste from the blood - If there is not enough water pressure, this may reduce the rate at which waste is filtered from the blood. Step 4: The clean blood is circulated out of the kidneys - The less effectively waste is filtered, the lesser clean blood is returned to circulation. Step 5: Excess water and waste is expelled from the kidneys in the form of urine - Reduced water pressure may result in less waste and excess water being expelled from the kidneys in the form of urine.

Plot title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

Way before the 'Scary Movie' series there were a few examples of this genre, mostly in the 80s. But like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss. Some like 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark' mostly rise above that, but other like 'Saturday the 14th' and it's sequel fail to deliver the laughs. But out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and that's 'Transylvania 6-5000,' a major waste of time for many reasons. Pros: A great cast that does it's best. Some of the dopey humor is amusing. A corny, but catch theme song. Some good Transylvanian locations. Cons: Threadbare plot. Mostly tedious pacing. Most of the humor just doesn't cut it. The monsters are given little to do and little screen time. I thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies? Lame ending that will likely make viewers angry. Final thoughts: This is a comedy? If it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between? Comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor, not roll our eyes and yawn, aching for it to be over. I can't believe Anchor Bay released this tired junk. I'll admit it's not one of the worst films ever made, but it's not worth anyone's time or money even if you're a fan of any of the actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead.

What was going on in that conversation?","completion":"In the conversation, Rory, Ed, and Greg are trying to fix an electrical device with a broken cord. They discuss how to address the issue and seek help from each other. At the beginning of the conversation, Rory asks for help in fixing the device, but they have already begun the process of opening and inspecting the device because the faceplate has been removed, as mentioned by Rory. Ed asks if the problem is related to the cord, and Rory confirms that the cord is broken, possibly as a result of being tied. Ed believes the cord should be easy to replace but admits he doesn't know much about electrical work. He suggests that they might want to ask Nedd, who appears to have expertise in this area, for assistance or maybe attempt to fix it themselves if it's a simple matter of retying the cord. Rory mentions that they have found the mechanism within the device but it looks complicated, and they are unsure how to proceed with fixing it. Ed acknowledges and offers assistance, but Rory decides the repair can wait until the next day. Finally, Greg intervenes and asks Ed to call the CPS (possibly a property management company, as they are responsible for the property), and it seems they plan to delegate the repair responsibility to them. Overall, the conversation revolves around the three friends trying to collectively address an issue with an element of an electrical device and their uncertainty on how to repair it. They weigh their options and contemplate seeking help from another individual or the relevant authorities, eventually deciding to contact the property management for assistance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Centripetal force is, simply, the force that causes centripetal acceleration. Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain. Now, I have a new situation: Adam wants to show his little brother a trick. He gets a bucket of water and says to him \\"I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out\\". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle. Answer this question please: Will the centripetal force on the bucket increase or decrease as Adam spins it faster? Answer:","completion":"As Adam spins the bucket faster, the centripetal force on the bucket will increase. This is because centripetal force is directly proportional to the square of the speed of the object (in this case, the bucket) as it moves in a circular path. As Adam increases the speed of the spinning bucket, the centripetal force acting on it will also increase, keeping the water inside the bucket due to the force pushing the water towards the bottom of the bucket, even when it is upside down."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Ku Klux Klan is the oldest and most well-known hate group in the United States. At one point, during its heyday, the Klan boasted a membership of around 4 million. That number has greatly dwindled, with the Southern Poverty and Law Center putting current numbers between 8,000 and 10,000. Despite their fewer numbers, the KKK has seen some recent exposure in mainstream society, most notably during this campaign season. In February, former Knights of the Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, and politician, David Duke expressed support for Donald Trump, telling listeners of his radio show they would “meet people who are going to have the same kind of mindset that you have” if they went to one of his rallies and that “voting against Donald Trump at this point is really treason to your heritage.” Trump came under heavy criticism for not immediately and consistently disavowing Duke. When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Trump if he would disavow Duke, his response was, “I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists….So I don’t know. I don’t know — did he endorse me, or what’s going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.” A few days later, Trump did reject Duke’s support, telling NBC: “I don’t mind disavowing anybody, and I disavowed David Duke. And I disavowed him the day before at a major news conference…. I have no problem disavowing groups, but I’d at least like to know who they are. It would be very unfair to disavow a group if the group shouldn’t be disavowed. I have to know who the groups are. But I disavowed David Duke.” Photographer Peter van Agtmael, on assignment for a European magazine, in 2015, headed to Tennessee and Maryland, where he spent time with some members of today’s KKK.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the passage provided, please answer the following question: What are the major applications of copper and its distribution in various industries, and how is it utilized both as a pure metal and in combination with other elements? The passage highlights the major applications of copper and its distribution across different industries. Copper is extensively used in electrical wires, which accounts for 60% of its total usage. This is primarily due to copper's high electrical conductivity, which makes it an ideal material for transmitting electricity. The second major application of copper is in roofing and plumbing, using up 20% of the copper supply. Copper's corrosion resistance and malleability make it suitable for these purposes, as it can be easily shaped and bent without breaking. Industrial machinery is another significant consumer of copper, representing 15% of its usage. In this application, copper is mainly used as a pure metal; however, when higher hardness is required, it is often combined with other elements to form an alloy. Only 5% of copper's total usage goes towards alloy production, with the most common alloys being brass and bronze. These alloys exhibit enhanced mechanical properties compared to pure copper, and they are often used for components that require increased strength, stiffness, and wear resistance. Besides its role as a structural material, copper is also employed in the production of compounds for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. Although this application constitutes a relatively small part of the copper supply, it demonstrates the metal's versatility and importance in various industries. Machining copper is possible, although using an alloy is generally necessary for creating intricate parts. This is because alloys offer better machinability characteristics compared to pure copper, allowing for more precise and complex designs. In summary, the major applications of copper can be categorized into electrical wires (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%), industrial machinery (15%), and alloy production (5%). Copper is primarily used as a pure metal, but alloys such as brass and bronze are employed when increased mechanical properties are needed. Additionally, copper plays a role in the manufacture of compounds for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture, further showcasing its widespread utility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Abstract Background and Purpose Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in survivors of acute life-threatening illness, but little is known about the burden of PTSD in survivors of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). This study estimated the prevalence of stroke or TIA-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Potentially relevant peer-reviewed journal articles were identified by searching the Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PILOTS Database, The Cochrane Library and Scopus from inception to January 2013; all searches were conducted on January 31, 2013. Observational cohort studies that assessed PTSD with specific reference to a stroke or TIA that occurred at least 1 month prior to the PTSD assessment were included. PTSD rates and characteristics of the study and sample were abstracted from all included studies. The coding of all articles included demographics, sample size, study country, and method and timing of PTSD assessment. Results Nine studies (N = 1,138) met our inclusion criteria. PTSD rates varied significantly across studies by timing of PTSD assessment (i.e., within 1 year of stroke/TIA versus greater than 1 year post-stroke/TIA; 55% of heterogeneity explained; Q 1 = 10.30; P = .001). Using a random effects model, the estimated rate of PTSD following stroke or TIA was 23% (95% CI, 16%–33%) within 1 year of the stroke or TIA and 11% (95% CI, 8%–14%) after 1 year. Conclusions Although PTSD is commonly thought to be triggered by external events such as combat or sexual assault, these results suggest that 1 in 4 stroke or TIA survivors develop significant PTSD symptoms due to the stroke or TIA. Screening for PTSD in a large population-based prospective cohort study with cardiovascular outcome assessments is needed to yield definitive prevalence, and determine whether stroke or TIA-induced PTSD is a risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular events or mortality.

Introduction Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder initiated by exposure to a traumatic event and is characterized by symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance of reminders of the event, persistent negative mood and cognition, and physiological hyperarousal that persist for at least 1 month after the event. Observational evidence suggests that PTSD is related to increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease [1] [2]. A recent meta-analysis further suggests that PTSD triggered by cardiovascular events - specifically, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - is associated with a doubling of risk for recurrent cardiac events and mortality [3] [4]. Until recently, only a few studies assessed PTSD due to stroke, another potentially traumatic acute cardiovascular event. Prevalence estimates in these studies has varied from 3–37% [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]. A more recent study, the largest on this topic to date, found that 18% of 535 stroke or TIA survivors reported clinically significant PTSD symptoms. While the association between stroke or TIA-induced PTSD and risk for recurrent stroke or other cardiovascular events was not examined, participants in this study were nearly three times more likely than those without PTSD symptoms to report medication nonadherence [13]. These data suggest that, similar to ACS-induced PTSD, stroke or TIA-induced PTSD may increase risk for recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events. This meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies was designed to estimate the overall prevalence of PTSD due to stroke or TIA. Methods Search Strategy and Selection Criteria We sought to identify all studies that reported a valid prevalence estimate of PTSD due to stroke or TIA. Included studies must have been observational cohorts and must have assessed PTSD with specific reference to a stroke or TIA that occurred at least 1 month prior to the PTSD assessment. Further, studies must have used a self-report PTSD screening instrument or clinical interview designed or specifically altered to query about only stroke or TIA-induced PTSD. For the one study that reported multiple PTSD assessments, we abstracted only the earliest estimate (at 1 month post-stroke) [10]. Potentially relevant peer-reviewed journal articles published in English were identified by a search of the biomedical electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PILOTS Database, The Cochrane Library and Scopus conducted by an information specialist (L.F.) with expertise in behavioral medicine. Databases were searched from inception to January 2013; all searches were conducted on January 31, 2013. All relevant subject headings and free-text terms were used to represent PTSD and stroke or TIA and the sets of terms were combined with AND. Terms for MEDLINE included: exp Stress Disorders, Traumatic/OR ptsd.tw. OR (post-traumatic OR (post adj traumatic)).tw or posttraumatic.tw. AND exp stroke/OR Stroke.tw OR cerebrovascular.tw. OR ((brain or vascular or lacunar or venous or cerebral or isch?emic) adj2 (accident or infarct or event or attack)).tw. Search terms were adapted for the other databases. Additional records were identified by scanning the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews and by employing the Related Articles feature in PubMed/Medline and the Cited Reference Search in Scopus. To determine the studies to be assessed further, two authors (S.R., D.E.) independently read the title, or title and abstract of every record retrieved. Opinion differences were resolved by consensus. All potentially relevant articles were investigated as full text. Database Construction and Coding We abstracted PTSD rates and characteristics of the study and sample from all included studies (Table 1). The coding of all articles included demographic information, sample size, study country, and method and timing of PTSD assessment. We also evaluated the quality of each study based on the Methodological Evaluation of Observational Research (MORE)- Observational Studies of Incidence or Prevalence of Chronic Diseases developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [14]. One study’s prevalence estimate, 7 and another’s demographic characteristics were uncertain [9], so authors were contacted to obtain this information. We converted one study’s prevalence estimate to make it consistent with the method used by the other studies that estimated prevalence using a screening questionnaire [13]. All studies that were included used either diagnostic interviews or well-validated self-report screening questionnaires that assessed PTSD specifically due to stroke or TIA.

Characteristics of Studies on the Prevalence of Stroke-Induced PTSD. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066435.t001 Quantitative Methods Comprehensive Meta-analysis (version 2, BioStat Software, Engelwood, NJ) served as the statistical platform for completing all statistical tests and associated graphic results. To summarize the prevalence findings, we computed prevalence point estimates using these formulas: Logit Event Rate = Log [Event Rate/(1 �?� Event Rate)]. Event Rate Standard Error = �?�(1/(Event Rate ·Sample Size)/(1/[(1�?�Event Rate) · Sample Size]), We computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using this formula: Lower Limit = Logit Event Rate �?� (1.96 · Logit Event Rate Standard Error). Upper Limit = Logit Event Rate+(1.96 · Logit Event Rate Standard Error). Results are presented after back-transformation. There was statistically significant heterogeneity in prevalence estimates, so random-effects models were used. In addition, we used sensitivity analyses to assess evidence of moderator effects for the prevalence results across two methodological factors: (1) method and (2) timing of PTSD assessment. Finally, we produced a forest plot and calculated both the classic and Orwin’s fail-safe N to address the issue of publication bias. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analytic review of stroke or TIA-induced PTSD. We found an overall prevalence of 13% among stroke/TIA survivors, with 23% prevalence in the first year post-stroke and 11% after the first year. Given that about 85% of the 795,000 patients who experience a stroke each year in the US [15] survive at least 30 days [16], and up to an additional 500,000 suffer from a TIA [17], these results suggest that 297,850 stroke and TIA survivors in the United States alone will develop PTSD symptoms due to the event annually. Within 90 days of the index stroke, 6% of survivors experience a recurrent stroke [18], and recurrence rates increase substantially over longer term follow up [19]. We do not yet know if stroke or TIA-induced PTSD is associated with increased risk for a recurrent cerebrovascular attack, but given the doubling of ACS recurrence risk due to ACS-induced PTSD [3] and recent research showing that PTSD is strongly associated with medication nonadherence [13], such research is sorely needed. Important caveats to this review include the fact that only studies with relatively small sample sizes have addressed stroke-induced PTSD, and one of the studies represented half of all of the participants included in this review. Also, none of the included studies used population-based sampling, and all but one study [10] relied on cross-sectional designs (and we used only the earliest point estimate, 1 month after stroke). Further, the PTSD screening questionnaires used in many of the studies have not been validated against clinical diagnosis of PTSD in survivors of stroke/TIA, though they perform very well in other patient populations. Thus, although this meta-analysis was able to quantify more precisely the prevalence of stroke-induced PTSD symptoms, a clear need for additional research remains. It is also important to note that we were very strict in our inclusion of only studies that measured PTSD specifically due to the stroke event, so these estimates may represent an underestimate of the total burden of PTSD symptoms in these participants in so much as PTSD due to other types of events may have been present. The estimated prevalence of stroke-induced PTSD was lower when PTSD was assessed by clinical interview. This may be due to the fact that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders is often higher when measured using diagnostic instruments as compared to clinical psychiatric interviews Nevertheless, research on the association between ACS-induced PTSD and ACS recurrence and mortality risk suggests that even elevated symptoms of PTSD, not clinical diagnosis, is associated with increased risk. Hence, the estimate of the prevalence of PTSD symptoms based on diagnostic instruments may still be clinically relevant [3]. Study Limitations Prevalence estimates were limited to patients who could participate in PTSD assessments and hence should be extrapolated to patients with severe cognitive impairment or aphasia with caution. Similarly, these results should be interpreted with awareness that the mean age of the participants was slightly low relative to the entire population of stroke survivors and PTSD is associated with younger age in ACS-induced PTSD [3], and therefore our rate estimate may not generalize to older stroke survivors. We were unable to determine whether the prevalence of PTSD differed if due to TIA or stroke, as the only study to include TIA survivors [13] did not record the proportion of participants who experienced either condition. Moreover, none of the studies reported on the severity of the stroke event in terms of the types of critical care that may have been necessitated such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Only one of the studies included in this review evaluated for stroke lesion localization [6], suggesting the need to further examine whether stroke location (i.e. hemisphere, etc) or the nature of the associated deficits (i.e. paresis/paralysis, aphasia, anosagnosia) further differentiate PTSD risk. Such knowledge would allow clinicians to identify those at higher risk for PTSD to implement early intervention. Similarly, we opted to retain one study that focused on PTSD due to subarachnoid hemorrhage, which clinicians and epidemiologists view as a distinct condition from stroke/TIA, because of the similarities in patient experience and because the aggregate estimate was not sensitive to its exclusion. Future research should determine whether PTSD due to subarachnoid hemorrhage is rightly grouped with PTSD due to stroke/TIA. It is also important to note the difference in prevalence estimates reported in studies that assessed PTSD by screening questionnaire versus clinical interview. Although screening questionnaires are often used to identify patients who should be further assessed for PTSD diagnosis–and therefore may overestimate prevalence–reliance on screening questionnaires for estimates of stroke-induced PTSD prevalence may further inflate those estimates due to overlap in symptoms of stroke and PTSD. Very little is known about the validity of PTSD questionnaire items in stroke survivors, but the evidence that exists suggests that PTSD questionnaires are valid in this population. In one study, confirmatory factor analysis of responses to the PTSD Checklist-specific for stroke conformed to the established factor structure for PTSD due to other types of events [13]. In another small study, PTSD severity was not related to either lesion site or neurologic and memory deficits that could be expected to inflate PTSD symptoms were the scale not valid [6]. Further research on the influence of neurologic and cognitive deficits on PTSD symptom expression is sorely needed. Finally, future research should also consider concomitance with other comorbid stroke factors including depression, however, it is important to note that the effect of ACS-induced PTSD on ACS recurrence and mortality is independent of depression [3]. Conclusions Across published studies estimating the prevalence of stroke-induced PTSD, two general conclusions can be drawn: (1) stroke-induced PTSD is relatively common, with approximately one in four experiencing PTSD in the first year after stroke and one in nine experiencing chronic PTSD over a year later, and (2) based on a single study, stroke-induced PTSD symptoms appear to influence important secondary prevention behaviors such as medication adherence [13], independent of depression. Though no data now exist to address the issue, if the risk of stroke or other cardiovascular event recurrence associated with stroke-induced PTSD is comparable to that found for PTSD after ACS, stroke-induced PTSD may be a significant, novel risk factor for recurrent stroke, especially given its high prevalence after stroke. Screening for PTSD in a large, population-based prospective cohort study would yield definitive prevalence and secondary risk estimates, and should be a priority for researchers. In the meantime, clinicians should be mindful that PTSD can be a devastating mental health condition and should consider screening for PTSD in stroke survivors. ||||| Post-traumatic stress disorder, known as PTSD, is not just a problem for military veterans, sexual assault survivors and other crime victims — it also plagues many stroke victims, according to new research. The study, published online Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, reports that 23% of stroke and mini-stroke victims surveyed within one year of the event suffered from PTSD. In addition, 11% of stroke victims surveyed more than a year after the event reported that they experienced PTSD. A stroke occurs when an artery carrying essential oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked or bursts, causing damage to the brain and potentially impairing speech, sight and motor control. A mini-stroke, also known as a transient ischemic attack, occurs in a similar way but lasts only a few minutes. Strokes kill about 137,000 people per year in the United States and in 2010 led to 73.7 billion in healthcare costs. The new research developed from a growing awareness that medical traumas can lead to PTSD. Study leader Donald Edmondson, an assistant professor at Columbia University, previously established that PTSD is common among heart attack survivors and that it is linked to an increased risk of later developing heart disease. This led his team to question how often stroke victims develop PTSD. “For something especially acute and scary like a stroke, we wondered: Why couldn’t that be a trigger for PTSD?” said Dr. Ian Kronish, a general internist at Columbia and part of the research team. PTSD is an anxiety disorder affecting about 7.7 million American adults. It is characterized by a traumatic event that leads to three families of symptoms: flashbacks and nightmares, avoidance of anything that triggers memories of the event, and hyper-vigilance. Scouring medical publications, the team compiled as much information as they could about PTSD prevalence in stroke victims. They found nine completed studies that met their criteria. In seven of the studies, participants were diagnosed with PTSD through a screening questionnaire, while interviews with a clinician were used for diagnosis in the other two studies. The data from the nine studies were combined for a total of 1,138 participants, all from the U.S. or Europe. All participants were assessed for PTSD between one and 60 months after the stroke. PTSD appeared more commonly within a year of the stroke (23% of participants) than a year or more out (11%). Kronish was surprised by the findings. “1 in 4 is a big number,” Kronish said about the studies examining PTSD within one year. “Until doing this research, I hadn’t really thought of PTSD being due to a medical event.” One limitation of the study was that in several cases, participants were assessed for PTSD using questionnaires that had not been cross-validated with clinical interviews among stroke victims. Future research aims to further examine the link between stroke and PTSD by following the same group of participants over time in order to specifically address whether the disorder increases the risk of additional strokes and heart disease. Future research will also examine how mental health intervention may reduce symptoms specifically in stroke victims. The study is available at the PLOS One website.

An MRI scan of the brain can show a stroke. (Photo: Photo Disc) Story Highlights PTSD may hinder recovery after a stroke or mini-stroke Stroke is the fourth-leading cause of death in the USA Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability A stroke may leave some survivors with post-traumatic stress disorder, which may hinder their recovery, according to a study released today. About 23% of patients who survive a stroke or transient ischemic attack, a brief interruption of blood flow to the brain, have PTSD symptoms within a year, the study finds. About 11% have chronic PTSD, in which symptoms last three months or longer, more than a year later. The study, led by Columbia University Medical Center researchers, was published online today in the journal PLOS ONE. \\"Strokes are among the most terrifying life-threatening events,\\" says lead author Donald Edmondson. People think about PTSD in relation to external events like war or sexual assault, says Edmondson, assistant professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia's Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health. \\"There is something different about PTSD after a stroke because the threat is inside your body,\\" he adds. The analysis looked at nine studies of PTSD induced by a stroke or TIA, sometimes called a mini-stroke. The studies included 1,138 stroke or TIA survivors in France, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States. The average age of participants was 64.5 and 47.5% were men. PTSD can develop after an event involving physical harm or the threat of physical harm, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Symptoms include having nightmares, avoiding reminders of the event and feeling tense. Treatments are psychotherapy, medications or a combination. Stroke is the fourth-leading cause of death in the USA, according to the American Stroke Association. It is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Ralph Sacco, an American Heart Association spokesman who was not involved in the study, says Edmondson's research looks at an under-recognized condition. \\"This is one of the first studies that investigates what's in the literature about PTSD after a stroke or TIA,\\" he adds. \\"We often think of PTSD as coming on after other kinds of stressful events — wars or other emotional events. \\"A stroke or TIA can be an emotionally charged event — some strokes can be life-threatening or potentially disabling,\\" says Sacco, chairman of neurology at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami. Edmondson says, \\"Our current results show that PTSD in stroke and TIA survivors may increase their risk for recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events.\\" The concern is that PTSD may threaten recovery. Previous research has shown that PTSD is associated with patients not adhering to their schedule for taking medications. Sacco recommends that stroke patients who suspect that they have PTSD symptoms get medical attention. Edmondson says there are good PTSD treatments. \\"But first, physicians and patients have to be aware that this is a problem,\\" he says. \\"Family members can also help. We know that social support is a good protective factor against PTSD due to any type of traumatic event.\\" He adds, \\"The next step is further research to assess whether mental health treatment can reduce stroke- or TIA-induced PTSD symptoms and help these patients regain a feeling of normalcy and calm as soon as possible after their health scare.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/11ZwnAv |||||","completion":"The study titled \\"Prevalence of PTSD in Survivors of Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack: A Meta-Analytic Review\\" by Edmondson et al., published in PLoS ONE in 2013, explores the prevalence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in survivors of stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). PTSD is commonly linked to traumatic events like combat or sexual assault, but this study investigates the mental health disorder's prevalence in survivors of acute life-threatening illnesses such as stroke and TIA. The researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis drawing from nine studies, involving a total of 1,138 subjects, that met their rigorous inclusion criteria. The coding for each included study incorporated aspects such as demographics, sample size, and methodology of PTSD assessment. Their estimates reveal that PTSD affected 23% of stroke or TIA survivors within one year of the event and 11% after one year. This suggests one in four stroke or TIA survivors could potentially exhibit considerable PTSD symptoms due to their health scare. The findings underscore that PTSD can be triggered by internal medical events, not only external traumatic events, contributing to our understanding of this mental health disorder. The results also hint that stroke or TIA-induced PTSD might be a risk factor for future cardiovascular events or mortality, although this warrants further investigation. Nonetheless, the study acknowledges certain limitations. For instance, the PTSD assessment questionnaires used in several of the studies haven't been cross-validated with clinical interviews among stroke victims. Moreover, the research was constricted to patients who could participate in PTSD assessments and may not be generalizable to patients with severe cognitive impairment or aphasia. Further research in this area will examine whether stroke or TIA-induced PTSD is associated with increased risk for recurring strokes or heart disease, as well as investigate how interventions could potentially decrease PTSD symptoms specifically in stroke survivors. Despite the limitations, the study gives researchers and clinicians insight into an underrecognized but common occurrence of PTSD in stroke or TIA survivors. Therefore, the authors recommend clinicians remain vigilant about potential PTSD in stroke survivors, considering it as they plan for patient care following stroke or TIA."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A team of Allied prisoners of war (POWs), coached and led by English Captain John Colby (Michael Caine), a professional footballer for West Ham United before the war, agree to play an exhibition match against a German team, only to find themselves involved in a German propaganda stunt. Colby is the captain and essentially the manager of the team and thus chooses his squad of players. Another POW, US Army Capt. Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone), on enlisted TDY to the Canadian Army, is not initially chosen, but eventually nags the reluctant Colby into letting him on the team as the team's trainer, as Hatch needs to be with the team to facilitate his upcoming escape attempt. Colby's superior officers repeatedly try to convince Colby to use the match as an opportunity for an escape attempt, but Colby consistently refuses, fearing that such an attempt will only result in getting his players killed. Meanwhile, Hatch has been planning his unrelated escape attempt, and Colby's superiors agree to help him, if he in return agrees to journey to Paris, make contact with the French Resistance, and try to convince them to help the football team escape. Hatch succeeds in escaping the prison camp, travelling to Paris, and finding the Resistance; at first, the Resistance decides that the plan to help the football team escape is too risky, but once they realise the game will be at the Colombes Stadium they plan the escape using a tunnel from the Paris sewer system to the showers in the players' changing room. They convince Hatch to let himself be recaptured, so he can pass information along back to the leading British officers at the prison camp. Hatch is indeed recaptured, but upon his recapture, he is put in solitary confinement.

That's what happened during a live radio show with Miley Cyrus's team. Let me explain what happened. Once upon a time, there was a famous singer named Miley Cyrus. She had many fans who loved her songs and performances. One day, Miley and her team of friends (also known as her \\"people\\") were talking to a DJ on a live radio show. A DJ is a person who plays music and talks with people on the radio. Everything was going well, and they were all having a good time. But then, the DJ started asking questions that were making Miley's team uncomfortable. Sometimes, people ask questions that are too personal or not very nice, and it can make others feel uneasy or upset. So, Miley's people decided to do something about it. They chose to \\"pull the plug\\" on the DJ. This doesn't mean they literally pulled a plug out of a wall, but it's a way to say they stopped the conversation with the DJ. They did this because they thought it was the best way to protect Miley and her feelings. The listeners of the radio show were surprised when the chat with Miley's team suddenly ended. It was a big deal because it doesn't usually happen on live radio. But, it's important to remember that everyone has a right to feel safe and comfortable, even if they're famous like Miley Cyrus. So, the next time you listen to the radio, remember this story and how important it is to be kind and considerate when asking questions. And always, be a good friend like Miley's people, who will stand up for her when she needs it most."},{"prompt":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what do pigs eat Suggested answer: Pigs are omnivores and are highly social and intelligent animals.

Would \\"When the 42nd U.S. Congress convened on March 4, 1871, Senators affiliated with President Grant, known as ‘’New Radicals’’ voted to oust Sen. Sumner from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairmanship.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the provided statement would not be a reasonable answer to the question, as it focuses on a later event in 1871 which does not directly address how the 'Bleeding Sumner' incident led to the Civil War. A more accurate and detailed response is provided below. The \\"Bleeding Sumner\\" incident refers to the violent attack on Sen. Charles Sumner by Rep. Preston Brooks in the U.S. Senate in May 1856. This event contributed to rising tensions between the North and South, ultimately leading to the Civil War. To understand how it played a role in the path to the Civil War, it is crucial to look at the broader context of this incident. The conflict between Sen. Sumner and Rep. Brooks stemmed from a speech Sumner gave on May 19-20, 1856, called \\"The Crime Against Kansas.\\" In the speech, Sumner criticized the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed the territories to decide if they would be admitted as free or slave states based on popular sovereignty. As a strong abolitionist, Sumner condemned slavery and criticized those who supported it or sought its expansion. Specifically, Sumner targeted two of his Senate colleagues, Sen. Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and Sen. Andrew P. Butler of South Carolina, who were both proponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and slavery. Sumner's harsh verbal attacks and personal insults towards Butler deeply angered Butler's relative, Rep. Preston Brooks. Feeling that his family's honor was at stake, Rep. Brooks sought retaliation and brutally assaulted Sen. Sumner with a cane on May 22, 1856, causing serious injuries to Sumner. The \\"Bleeding Sumner\\" incident intensified the already strained relations between the North and the South: 1. Highlighted sectional tensions: The incident highlighted the growing divide between Northern and Southern politicians over the issue of slavery. Sumner became a symbol of Northern resolve against slavery and its extension to new territories, while Brooks gained notoriety in the South for his defense of Southern honor and pro-slavery principles. 2. Demonstrated the intensity of the conflict: The violence in the Senate illustrated that the debate over slavery was no longer confined to intellectual or legislative discussions—physical violence had entered the political discourse, demonstrating the depth of emotions around these issues. 3. Strengthened the resolve of Abolitionists and anti-slavery activists: The attack on Sumner galvanized anti-slavery activists in the North, who pointed to the incident as a sign of Southern brutality and the need for more vigorous opposition to the spread of slavery into new territories. 4. Solidified the positions of both sides: Particularly in the 1856 presidential election, the incident influenced political campaigns and platforms, further polarizing the nation. It solidified the positions of both the North and the South, making it increasingly difficult for compromise on contentious issues like slavery and state sovereignty. In summary, the \\"Bleeding Sumner\\" incident was an important event that contributed to the escalation of tensions between the North and the South in the years leading up to the Civil War. It demonstrated the increasingly violent nature of the political debate around slavery, further polarized the nation, and helped set the stage for the ultimate conflict in 1861."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Where the Real Sarabeth Dines Be prepared to ditch the brogues or stilettos before setting foot in Sarabeth Levine’s immaculate (and she wants to keep it that way) two-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side. “I’m a very clean person and I have a very clean apartment,” said Ms. Levine, 70, the owner, with her husband, Bill, 81, of the half-dozen restaurants in New York City that bear her name; an equal number of outposts in Westchester, Long Island, Key West and Tokyo; and a mail-order food business. “I have wood floors and they are very well cared for. You can eat off them, and that is not an exaggeration.” It’s true, the honey-toned floors look as though they were installed yesterday. The light that pours in extravagantly on sunny days intensifies the glow. But with all due respect to the oak planks that pave the railroad apartment’s 1,500 square feet, first-time visitors will almost certainly find their eyes turned elsewhere. Specifically, they’ll be staring at the kitchen while trying valiantly not to blurt out something on the order of “But it’s so ... small” or “Seriously? Formica counters?” or “A Magic Chef stove? I guess the store was all out of Viking and Garland.” To be fair, the space, which was renovated in 1991 and has a slight ’50s feel, is utterly respectable. The speckled countertops and white cabinets are in fine shape; the appliances gleam, and so what if the refrigerator isn’t Sub-Zero. But it’s out of sync with expectations, rather like finding a plastic wading pool in Michael Phelps’s backyard. “People never say anything when they see my kitchen,” said the wiry, bespectacled Ms. Levine, who looks like a character out of “Doonesbury.” “Kitchens are great, and beautiful kitchens are very beautiful. But here’s my belief about kitchens: a big fancy one doesn’t make you a cook. “And remember, I’m always around food in my restaurants and in my bakery business. I have large stoves and huge walk-in refrigerator-freezers and machines that roll out dough for me, so my equipment desire is satisfied at my workplace. The last thing I wanted at home was a monster stove, O.K.? For me, my kitchen is perfect the way it is. It reflects my character. It’s nice, it’s cozy.” The relative absence of kitchen jewelry also means there’s plenty of room to display the choice pieces in Ms. Levine’s assemblage of cake platters, teapots and vintage cookie jars. “I love cookie jars,” she said. “They signify home — and cookies. My grandchildren were going to call me Grandma Cookie. I 86’ed that one.” Pride of place goes to the three containers with a likeness of the comic-strip character Little Lulu. “I love Little Lulu,” Ms. Levine said. “She was a brat. She was spunky and bossy. She had stamina. That’s me. I have stamina.” That stamina helps when Ms. Levine is on the hunt for this or that desirable thing. When, for example, she discovered a pair of discarded mint-condition Maison Gatti cafe chairs on the sidewalk, she brought them home for the kitchen, had four made in a reverse pattern, and then triumphantly bid on another six for her weekend house in Water Mill, N.Y., after seeing them on display at a Housing Works thrift shop. Ms. Levine married into the fifth-floor apartment, which for years had been the home/office of Mr. Levine, the former co-owner of a construction business. Sarabeth and Bill met in a singles group in 1979 and quickly discovered just how much they had in common. He was divorced. She was divorced. He was mensch-y. She was mensch-y. He had two daughters. She had two daughters. He had just acquired a piece of a soon-to-open restaurant on East 34th Street and was uncertain about the menu. She had a great family recipe for orange-apricot marmalade. “I made it for the opening and everyone flipped over it,” said Ms. Levine, a self-taught cook. Personally and professionally everything jelled. “I started putting the marmalade in jars,” she said. “I took it to Balducci’s and told them Bloomingdale’s had bought it, which wasn’t true. And I went to Bloomingdale’s and told them Balducci’s had bought it.” The wedding was in 1981, the year Sarabeth first put her name on a retail space —a small bakery. Bill ultimately ditched construction to help her build the business. Fittingly, the apartment is a blend of his (the antique brass bed); hers (the kidney-shaped desk topped with a Deco Chase lamp, the diminutive rocking chair); and theirs (a side-by-side bow-front cabinet that holds an assortment of Limoges pieces, among them a croissant and a banana, gifts to Ms. Levine from Mr. Levine). The living room has a fireplace, a basic necessity for Ms. Levine, and a piano that she plays strictly for her own enjoyment. Mr. Levine plops in the shabby-chic easy chair, Ms. Levine claims the sofa. Dinner is carryout, often from Chirping Chicken, never from Sarabeth’s — it’s too much like taking work home —though they make an exception for the restaurant’s biscuits and Caesar salad dressing. “This is where we go to relax,” she said. “We’ll sit in here and eat off the coffee table and watch our favorite programs and just hang out.” The quiet, the abundant light, the way Ms. Levine can see the fireplace from the kitchen — the apartment is pretty much perfection. But she speaks longingly of a foyer. “That’s the one thing I wish I had,” she said. “When you walk in here there’s no place to settle yourself. But it certainly doesn’t make me want to move.” Not a chance of that. Because Ms. Levine likes to meet with the night team at the company bakery where she spends the bulk of her time, the workday doesn’t end until 7:30, sometimes later if she stops by one of her restaurants. “So for me when the cab lets me out in front of our building, it’s like, ‘Sigh, I’m home,’ ” she said. “I get into the elevator, I push ‘5’ and I just can’t wait to get upstairs.” A version of this article appears in print on February 9, 2014, on page RE4 of the New York edition with the headline: Where the Real Sarabeth Dines. Order Reprints|Today's Paper|Subscribe","completion":"The article discusses Sarabeth Levine's apartment on the Upper West Side and provides a glimpse into her personal life. Sarabeth, 70, and her husband, Bill, 81, own several restaurants in New York City, Westchester, Long Island, Key West, and Tokyo, as well as a thriving mail-order food business. The focus of the article is on the simplicity of their home, particularly the kitchen, which is contrasted with people's expectations given their successful business empire. The kitchen is described as small, with Formica counters and a Magic Chef stove. Sarabeth explains that she doesn't need a big, showy kitchen at home as she gets to work in professional kitchens in her businesses every day. Sarabeth's home is filled with character and a blend of her and her husband's belongings, including vintage cookie jars, antique furniture, and various knick-knacks. Sarabeth appreciates the quiet and the abundant natural light in their apartment, and although she wishes she had a foyer, she has no desire to move. She values the sanctuary their home provides after her long workdays, overseeing staff at her restaurants and bakery. The article concludes with a quote from Sarabeth expressing her gratitude for the comfort and refuge her home offers: \\"So for me when the cab lets me out in front of our building, it’s like, ‘Sigh, I’m home,’...I get into the elevator, I push ‘5’ and I just can’t wait to get upstairs.”"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

During the mission, Bond notices that the KGB sniper assigned to prevent Koskov's escape is a female cellist from the orchestra. Disobeying his orders to kill the sniper, he instead shoots the rifle from her hands, then uses the Trans-Siberian Pipeline to smuggle Koskov across the border into Austria and then on to Britain. In his post-defection debriefing, Koskov informs MI6 that the KGB's old policy of Smiert Spionam, meaning Death to Spies, has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is later abducted from the safe-house and assumed to have been taken back to Moscow. Bond is directed to track down Pushkin in Tangier and kill him to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two brothers went to the doctor for their yearly examination. Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters. But I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. What is an answer for this question: Which brother was more at risk for heart disease? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Liam, the brother with high cholesterol, is at a higher risk for heart disease compared to Rudy, whose triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters. Cholesterol plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis and the subsequent formation of plaques within the arterial walls. These plaques can hinder blood flow, contributing to high blood pressure and a reduced oxygen supply to the heart. When blood flow is severely limited or blocked entirely, the risk of a heart attack increases, potentially resulting in serious damage or even death. Since Liam has high cholesterol, he is more susceptible to these health complications than his brother Rudy, whose cholesterol levels are within the normal range. Thus, it is crucial for Liam to work closely with his doctor to manage his cholesterol levels and reduce his risk for heart disease through lifestyle modifications and, if necessary, medications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change.As one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane,this is the only footage of the first impact.He rides with the firemen to the WTC and goes inside the building.As the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident.In the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible,in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds,these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground,this is the most grueling moment in the documentary.Then the tower collapses and our French friend has to run for his life,you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building.Then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black,he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of Downtown New York.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the first name of the daughter of the man who premiered a stream of \\"desk drawer\\" works in 1953? ? Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.)

Work began in May 1940 resulting in 13,000,000 cubic yards (9,900,000 m3) of material dredged from the opening of Pearl Harbor to build a channel to Ford Island as well as to create a turning channel around the island. Material was also dredged to deepen the West Loch, East Loch, and Middle Loch for the mooring of battleships. With dredged material used as land fill, the island's size was increased from 334 acres (135 ha) to 441 acres (178 ha).The Navy replaced its PK, F5L, and H16 aircraft with newer models (see table below). In 1933 VP-8F arrived on station, and in 1935 the army bombers had become too large to be maintained and stored at Luke Field. Construction began on a new Army airfield, Hickam Army Airfield, named after pioneer U.S. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam. From 1936 to 1940 Pan American flew its Clipper service into Ford Island, using it as a refueling stop between the United States and Asia. The Navy built a 25,000 boathouse, spent 579,565 on a new crew barracks and built a firehouse, water-supply and lighting systems. In June 1936 the Navy lengthened the island's landing field by 400 feet (120 m), to 3,000 feet (910 m). In March 1937 Amelia Earhart, on her second visit to Luke Field, crashed her Lockheed Electra on takeoff. In 1939, after three years of construction, Hickam Field opened. The Army transferred its operations there, leaving Luke Field under Navy control. The latter was renamed Naval Air Station Ford Island, and became the headquarters of Patrol Wing 2; its former namesake was re-honored with a new base, Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.

(August 2015) Abby Barnes (Garofalo) is a veterinarian and host of a radio show called The Truth About Cats and Dogs. When she makes a blind date with Brian (Chaplin), a caller to her show, her insecurity about her appearance leads her to persuade her more conventionally attractive (though less intellectual) friend Noelle (Thurman) to pretend to be Abby on their date. Both women develop feelings for Brian, leading to a series of comic misunderstandings. Brian's persistence in pursuing Noelle in person is thwarted as Noelle tries to maneuver him toward the real Abby. After Abby behaves jealously while drunk and embarrasses herself at a photo shoot, she leaves and it appears to her that Brian and Noelle sleep together. However, Noelle actually leaves too, and Brian, distressed by Noelle's changing attitude, corners Abby in her apartment where he finds evidence of her real identity as the radio host he fell for through her voice. As Abby and Noelle attempt to explain, Brian decides he has been the victim of a practical joke and leaves in disgust. Abby later approaches Brian at his regular bar and explains what happened, and although initially dismissive, he eventually meets with Abby and he has fallen for the real Abby and was only attracted to Noelle because of their deception.

Options: --yes; --it is not possible to tell; --no;","completion":"--no; The hypothesis cannot be concluded as true if the premise is true for several reasons. First, as per the premise, the woman is a Texas A&M tennis player, which means she is primarily involved in the sport of tennis, not basketball. Tennis and basketball are both distinct sports with different sets of rules, equipment, and requisite skills. While it is possible that she might be playing basketball recreationally or during her leisure time, the premise makes no mention of her abilities or involvement in that sport. Secondly, the act of \\"dribbling\\" in the context of the premise refers to bouncing the tennis ball, which is not how that term is used in the context of basketball. In basketball, dribbling is the act of bouncing the basketball while moving on the court, and it is a crucial skill in the sport. In tennis, however, players do not generally dribble the ball during a game, as the objective is to hit the ball over the net and into the opponent's side of the court. The action of bouncing a tennis ball does not necessarily indicate a connection to basketball. Thirdly, the fact that the woman is from Texas A&M might not have any bearing on her supposed participation in basketball. Texas A&M is a large university with numerous athletic programs, and it is not uncommon for student-athletes to participate in only one sport at the collegiate level. As the premise states that she is a tennis player, it is more reasonable to assume her focus is on tennis, rather than basketball.

All the four kinds of special land birds can only be seen on Henderson Island. There are also fifteen non-local seabirds. Other local things include nine kinds of plants, four kinds of land snails, and one butterfly. Although no people live on the island, archaeological evidence suggests that a small Polynesian group lived here between the 12th and 15th centuries until it disappeared. The reasons for its disappearance are unknown, but are probably related to the similar disappearance of the Polynesians on Pitcairn Island. Then Hendersonians would have depended on them for many of the basics of life. On January 29* 1606, Henderson Island was discovered by Portuguese sailor Pedro Fermandes, who named it San Joao Baptista. On January 17, 1819, the island was rediscovered by British Captain Henderson, who named it Henderson Island. On March 2* 1819* Captain Henry King, sailing on the Elizabeth, landed on the island to find the Union flag already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship on a tree, and for some years the name of the island was Elizabeth or Henderson. In the early 1980's, American businessman Arthur expressed interest in buying Henderson Island, and establishing a small settlement with an airport, farm and large houses. But the British government refused it at last* after environmentalist groups persuaded them to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island which became a World Heritage Site later.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates? from the following article ? Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

The answer to the question: What two contributions did the four lunette murals symbolize? is inside the article: The Pennsylvania State Capitol houses the chambers for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, the Pennsylvania Senate, and the Harrisburg chambers for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The Capitol contains 475 rooms and has four floors, not including a mezzanine between the first and second floors, and a basement. The bronze entrance doors of the capitol lead into the rotunda on the first floor with the grand staircase in the center. The staircase in the rotunda is an imperial staircase, similar to the one in the Palais Garnier in Paris, France. The staircase leads to the mezzanine between the first and second floors, before dividing into two staircases leading to the second floor. Edwin Austin Abbey painted four allegorical medallions around the base of the capitol dome, detailing the \\"four forces of civilization\\": Art, Justice, Science, and Religion. Four lunette murals were also painted by Abbey and \\"symbolize Pennsylvania's spiritual and industrial contributions to modern civilization\\". The lunettes are situated in the recesses of each arch in the rotunda. The rotunda is paved with tiles, hand-crafted by Henry Chapman Mercer, from the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works. Mercer produced 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2) of tile, which includes \\"377 mosaics, representing 254 scenes, artifacts, animals, birds, fish, insects, industries and workers from Pennsylvania history\\". The interiors of the rotunda and the dome are inscribed with a quote from William Penn made upon the foundation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: There may be room there for such a holy experiment.

Here is an article: While the Corvetteâs 61-year history has included some spectacular cars, aspirations for the 2014 model are the highest yet. The Stingray badge evokes the beloved second generation. More Photos » Imagine, if you will, that an unnamed manufacturer just released an all-new sports car. It rockets from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.8 seconds, pulls more than one lateral g on the skid pad and has a carbon-fiber hood and roof. The interior includes dual high-resolution screens, top-quality materials and the option of racing seats. The manual transmission, with 7 forward speeds, will execute rev-matched downshifts, and itâs mounted at the rear of the car for optimal weight distribution. Other serious performance hardware include a dry-sump oiling system (which keeps the engine lubricated during neck-straining cornering maneuvers), an electronically controlled differential and magnetic ride-control suspension. All of this is concealed beneath bodywork thatâs thoroughly dripping in exotic, low-slung menace. If Porsche made such a car, it would cost 125,000. If its fenders wore Ferrari badges, it would cost 200,000. But weâre talking about a Chevy with a starting price of 51,995. And this fact blows our minds just a little bit less because the car is a Corvette. Where that particular vehicle is concerned, weâve come to expect outrageous returns on our dollar. The Corvette has a long and often glorious history. But that continuity, stretching back to 1953, means that every new generation of the Corvette tends to be viewed through the prism of its predecessor. And itâs tempting to think of this seventh-generation Corvette Stingray (in âVette lingo, the C7) in terms of the sixth-generation Vette â itâs like a C6 with better seats, more power, better behavior at the limit. But then you start itemizing the list of aspects that are different, both quantifiable and subjective, and you realize that the C7 isnât much like a C6 at all. The new carâs ambitions are fundamentally loftier, a point underscored by the return of the Stingray name. (Chevrolet is surely hoping to evoke the world-beating 1963 Sting Ray rather than the 1976 model â a fixture of the âBoogie Nightsâ era â that last wore the badge.) Start with the handling. âHandlingâ was never something the old âVette was overly concerned with, as long as its lap times were low enough. The carâs breakaway behavior was a particular problem, as it would let go suddenly and with great drama â the C6 Corvette is the only car Iâve ever spun on a racetrack with the stability control system engaged. If Khrushchev and Kennedy had been that twitchy, we might all still be eating canned peas in our fallout shelters while watching âLeave It to Beaver.â The C7, though, is friendly and controllable all the way to the limit. The Z51 performance package includes an electronically controlled differential (called eLSD) that allows fine modulation of the carâs rear-end behavior, instantly adjusting from locked and stable to open and nimble, depending on the requirements at hand. After spending some quality time sliding around the Black Lake testing area at General Motorsâ proving ground in Milford, Mich., I concluded that buying a âVette without the Z51 package would be like getting a puppy without a leash. If you spend a little bit more for a leash, youâre going to have a lot better control of that puppy, right? And the Z51 package is a bargain. For 2,800 you get performance gearing, a transmission and differential cooler, bigger wheels and tires, bigger brakes, a firmer suspension, the dry-sump oil system and the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance, that magic differential. I would also opt for the magnetic ride control system with performance traction management, which goes for 1,795. And the multimode performance exhaust costs a not-insignificant 1,195, but is worth it for the wonderful sounds, if not the five extra horsepower that it uncorks. So equipped, you have a 57,785 car that has everything you need. The Corvette Stingray is not a case where the base price is merely a teaser and the car you really want costs 50 percent more.

(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1965, Mossad agent Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain) arrives in East Berlin to meet with fellow agents David Peretz (Sam Worthington) and Stefan Gold (Marton Csokas). Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen)âinfamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War IIâand bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as an ethnic German married couple from Argentina and Rachel plants herself as a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. Both Stefan and David develop an attraction to Rachel. Rachel shows a preference for David, yet sleeps with Stefan shortly after David rebukes her advances. This tryst leads to Rachel becoming pregnant. Stefan also reveals to Rachel that David lost his entire family in The Holocaust. At a doctors appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse (Vogel's wife) to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in a faux ambulance, barely ahead of the real ambulance team. Under cover of night, the trio attempt their exfiltration at Wollankstrasse Station, on a railway line along the sector boundary between East and West Berlin, and next to a mail depot. As they prepare to load Vogel onto the stopped train he suddenly awakens and sounds the horn of the stolen mail van where he is being held, alerting East German guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to collect the compromised Rachel.

The premiere of Current’s Countdown With Keith Olbermann averaged 179,000 viewers in news’ target demographic of 25- to 54-year-olds Monday at 8 p.m., according to numbers provided by Current. That’s a big improvement for Current, which averaged 30,000 viewers in primetime for the first quarter. PHOTOS: Keith Olbermann's Famous Feuds Countdown also beat CNN in the demo at 8 p.m. – by a wide margin. Eliot Spitzer’s In the Arena pulled in 89,000 viewers in the demo. (Spitzer was not anchoring due to a planned vacation.) But MSNBC’s Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell notched 237,000 in the demo. Nevertheless, it is a solid start for Olbermann on his new network, which is in about 37 percent fewer households than CNN and MSNBC. COVER STORY: The Confessions of Keith Olbermann Olbermann has downplayed ratings expectation, but he’s clearly gunning for the competition on his former network. His show will consistently run past the 9 p.m. hour, a tactic commonly employed to stanch channel switching. VIDEO: Keith Olbermann Presents Top 10 List on 'Late Show With David Letterman' “We’re very pleased,” said Olbermann. “But like I said last week, it’s one night. We’ll need a couple of weeks to know where we're starting, and we're truly interested in next year and especially 2013.” ||||| Keith Olbermann rallied the troops on Twitter, gave a flurry of high profile interviews, and his new bosses at Current TV backed him with their best efforts at promoting their new franchise. The reality check came Tuesday, from Nielsen. According to ratings data released by Current, the Monday night debut of Countdown with Keith Olbermann had 179,000 viewers in the advertiser-coveted–and critical–demographic of viewers 25-54. The network declined to say what the show’s total viewing audience was. “It’s one night. We’ll need a couple of weeks to know where we’re starting,” Olbermann said in a statement released by the network. While the network said it was also very pleased with the ratings, Olbermann’s move from MSNBC to Current has cost him in viewership. His old timeslot at MSNBC, now occupied by Lawrence O’Donnell, attracted 237,000 viewers in the demo–and that was only good enough for a third place finish behind Fox News and HLN’s Nancy Grace. Olbermann did beat CNN, In the Arena, but that show’s host, Eliot Spitzer has been off this week, and CNN’s ratings overall have been lower as interest in the Casey Anthony murder trial seems to have sent viewers to HLN for its wall-to-wall coverage. Will viewers find Olbermann and bring the ratings up? As the host said, it takes time for new shows (even ones that look pretty much identical to old shows) to find their groove. But as a rule, opening night ratings tend to be higher than the nights that follow, as curious drop-in viewers who want to have a look on the first night don’t come back. More than two million viewers tuned in to watch CNN’s Piers Morgan open his new show with guest Oprah Winfrey. On Monday, with guest Ryan O’Neal, the total viewership was a far smaller 689,000. The difference between Morgan and Olbermann, however, is the network that surrounds each show. CNN has strong viewership throughout the day and night to remind viewers about Piers Morgan Tonight and promote the show. Current, with its significantly smaller average audience, is pitching Countdown to a comparatively tiny group of viewers, forcing Current to spend money on advertising the show, or, as they did last night, sending Olbermann off in search of free media with an appearance on CBS’ Late Show with David Letterman. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Keith Olbermann's show, Countdown, premiered on a channel called Current and was watched by 179,000 people aged 25-54.

Beginning the Age of Revolution, the American Revolution and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the American Revolutionary War (also called American War of Independence).

In this task, you will be shown an English sentence. You need to classify the sentence as either a representation of an anaphor number agreement or as an incorrect representation. An anaphor is an expression whose interpretation depends upon another expression. Anaphor number agreement is a restriction where a phrase agrees with the preceeding expression: plurals match plurals or singular expressions match singular expressions. In this task a valid representation of anaphor number agreement should be denoted as 'good' while everything else should be denoted as 'bad'. A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement will be a grammatically correct instance of a sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality.

The original statement was \\"Greyhounds jumping out of the gate at a race.\\" The key words here are \\"Greyhounds\\", \\"jumping out\\", \\"gate\\", and \\"race\\". These words together tell us that greyhounds are initiating a race, as \\"jumping out of the gate\\" is the phrase used to denote the start of a race. Given the information present in the first statement, it is suggested that the greyhounds are, indeed, racing. When we consider the second sentence \\"Greyhounds are not racing\\", we can infer based on the given information that this statement is false. If greyhounds are \\"jumping out of the gate at a race,\\" they are by default involved in a race, which contradicts the statement that greyhounds are not racing.

News article: Internet troll (and potential 2016 presidential candidate) Rand Paul celebrated Valentine's Day with a Hillary Clinton Pinterest profile he tweeted out Saturday. If Hillary Clinton set up a Pinterest for Valentine's Day, we can only imagine it might look like this>>>https://t.co/nNfAynLJxE — Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) February 14, 2015 The profile has the hallmarks of a traditional Pinterest page with an \\"inspirational quotes\\" board... ...and one for home decor ideas. Then there's some more pointed jabs, like a board of photos of Democrats who lost in November... a pin about her Russian reset button... ... and another about her comment that she and Bill were \\"dead broke\\" when they left the White House and the money she makes from speaking gigs. Trolling other 2016 hopefuls has become a past time for Paul. He's tweeted burns directed at Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush; he's not above using memes. But Paul isn't the only one using Internet culture and parody accounts to reach voters. Last month, the Democratic National Committee created a parody a Jeb Bush Instagram account to make fun of Bush's digital strategy. Brace yourselves; 2016 looks to be the most meme-filled election in American history. ||||| Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky) is choosing Valentine’s Day to take a jab at Hillary Clinton. On Saturday morning, the senator’s Facebook page posted a message saying that “if Hillary Clinton set up a Pinterest page, we can only imagine it might look like this.” It included links to a mock profile on the photo-sharing site set up under Mrs. Clinton’s name. The profile includes several references to moments that Mrs. Clinton likely would not highlight in a presidential campaign. One section called “shoulda, woulda, coulda” showcases images from her unsuccessful 2008 White House bid. The profile also takes a jab at suspended NBC News anchor Brian Williams, with a picture of him interviewing Mrs. Clinton. The accompanying text reads: “You tell me your war story, I’ll tell you mine.” Mrs. Clinton in 2008 had acknowledged making a mistake when she said she had come under hostile fire while in Bosnia. Mr. Williams is currently suspended for telling a false war story related to his time in Iraq. This is not the first time the senator has used social media to take a jab at Mrs. Clinton or other likely White House candidates. In January, Mr. Paul’s political action committee, Rand PAC, posted an audio link of a fake phone call between Jeb Bush and Mrs. Clinton, in which actors portraying them argued over who’s “turn” it was to move into the White House. Mr. Paul’s PAC is also asking his followers to sign a petition to “say no” to Mrs. Clinton running for president. Pinterest, a platform often used to share recipes and fitness tips, was used in the 2012 presidential campaign by Ann Romney to connect with women. Mrs. Romney’s pins were mostly recipes, patriotic photos and books. ______________________________________________________ Politics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. (NEW!)

The Kentucky senator tweeted out a link Saturday to a parody Pinterest page that uses some tired anti-Hillary tropes to lampoon the potential Democratic presidential nominee. “Hillary Clinton’s new Valentine’s Day Pinterest board is worth a look,” wrote Paul. “Check it out and please RT!” The Pinterest page, which uses the same profile image as Clinton’s genuine Twitter account, includes pictures on themes that figure to be prominent Republican attack lines should Clinton pursue the 2016 Democratic nomination for president: among them Clinton’s ties to President Obama; anxiety over the prospect of Bill Clinton’s return to the White House; and of course, Benghazi.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Broncos made their first visit to Tampa Bay since 2004. Cornerback Aqib Talib, who made his return to Tampa Bay where he played for the Buccaneers from 2018-2012, intercepted Buccaneers' quarterback Jameis Winston on the third play of the opening drive. The Broncos immediately capitalized, with quarterback Trevor Siemian throwing an 11-yard touchdown to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. On the Buccaneers' next drive, a 7-yard touchdown run by Winston tied the game, which would be the Buccaneers' only scoring play of the game. Following another interception of Winston by Talib, the Broncos re-claimed the lead, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back C. J. Anderson. With 3:25 remaining in the first half, Siemian injured his non-throwing shoulder when he was sacked by defensive tackle Clinton McDonald, and backup quarterback Paxton Lynch, the team's first-round draft selection, took over in his NFL debut.

Question 2: How can I have 2 WhatsApp accounts for the same number on different devices? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are asking different questions related to WhatsApp usage on different devices with one number or account. Question 1: Is it possible to use WhatsApp on two different devices associated with the same number/account? Answer: Currently, you cannot use WhatsApp on two different devices using the same number or account simultaneously. WhatsApp employs a one-phone, one-account policy, and it does not support multi-device compatibility with a single phone number or account. However, it is essential to note that WhatsApp currently has a feature called \\"WhatsApp Web,\\" which allows users to access their WhatsApp account on a computer or tablet via a QR code linked to their mobile device. This is not a standalone feature, and it only works while your mobile phone stays connected to the internet, which means your phone, computer, or tablet need to be connected to the internet at the same time. Question 2: How can I have 2 WhatsApp accounts for the same number on different devices? Answer: It is not possible to have two WhatsApp accounts associated with the same phone number on different devices. WhatsApp uses your phone number as the unique identifier for creating your account, and having two accounts with the same number goes against their guidelines. However, if you wish to have separate WhatsApp accounts on two devices, you can consider the following workaround: 1. Use two different phone numbers: You can register with two different phone numbers on two separate devices. For this, you need to have two different SIM cards, one for each account. You can use one for personal use and the other for work or any other purpose. Each phone number will have its own, separate WhatsApp account. 2. Use Parallel Space or Dual Apps feature: Some smartphones offer a built-in feature called Dual Apps or App Twin, which allows users to clone their apps and have multiple instances of the same app on their device. This way, you can use two different WhatsApp accounts on your phone by cloning the WhatsApp application and using a different phone number for each account. This feature might vary depending on the device brand and model. Remember that using the Dual Apps feature still requires two different phone numbers, one for each instance of the WhatsApp app on your device. In summary, questions 1 and 2 differ - question 1 refers to using a single WhatsApp account on two different devices, while question 2 asks about having two separate WhatsApp accounts for a single phone number (albeit on different devices)."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"what is the last ethnicity mentioned?\\" is in \\"Although critics have blamed Napoleon for several tactical mistakes preceding the battle, they have also praised his audacity for selecting a risky campaign strategy, choosing to invade the Italian peninsula from the north when the vast majority of French invasions came from the west, near or along the coastline.

Born in Cairo in 1929, Arafat became involved in the Palestinian cause from a young age and eventually founded Fatah, a nationalist political party aimed at establishing an independent Palestinian state. Under Arafat's leadership, the PLO became the primary organization fighting for the rights of the approximately 9 million Palestinian people living in the Israeli-occupied territories of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Negotiations with Israel were often contentious, but Arafat played a pivotal role in representing Palestinian interests and pushing for a viable two-state solution. In 1994, Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize along with Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres for their efforts to establish peace in the region through the Oslo Accords. Although the peace process faced several setbacks in the following years, Arafat remained a constant presence in the fight for Palestinian self-determination. In October 2004, Arafat's health began to decline rapidly, with the leader suffering from severe flu-like symptoms and the inability to keep food down. As his condition worsened, he was transferred from his besieged compound in Ramallah to a French military hospital for specialized medical treatment. While rumors circulated about the possible causes of his illness, ranging from food poisoning to a more grave condition, the exact nature of his ailment remained undiagnosed. The deterioration of Arafat's health obviously had significant implications for the Palestinian people and the future of the peace process. His absence from the helm of Palestinian politics left a vacuum that raised questions about who would emerge as the new leader and whether they would be able to continue Arafat's pursuit of a Palestinian state. As Arafat's condition worsened and he slipped in and out of consciousness, prayers for his recovery were held throughout Palestine, highlighting the deep connection many Palestinians felt toward their leader. Unfortunately, Arafat passed away on November 11, 2004, and his death marked the end of an era in the Palestinian struggle for statehood. To this day, Yasser Arafat remains a divisive figure in the Middle East, with some praising him as a freedom fighter and others denouncing him as a terrorist. Nevertheless, his impact on the Palestinian struggle for independence and the wider Middle Eastern peace process cannot be denied. His weakening health, as described in the statement, marked the beginning of a challenging period for Palestinian leadership and the ongoing quest for a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years.

He said, \\"Let's make a big, big money box and fill it with £80 million (it's a lot of money!) to help pay for the special medicine.\\" This money box is called a \\"fund,\\" and it would help the hospitals and other buildings get the special medicines to the sick people who need them.

Emphasizing their vital importance, the speaker refers to SMEs as the \\"lifeblood of the European economy.\\" SMEs play a fundamental role in driving economic growth, fostering innovation, and creating employment opportunities. They represent the majority of businesses in the European Union and account for a significant share of private sector employment and value addition within the economy.

In line with the statement, the speedy implementation of instruments, policies, and support measures tailored to address the unique challenges faced by SMEs could help expedite their recovery. Possible instruments may include government-backed financial assistance, tax incentives, or regulatory reforms aimed at reducing administrative burdens and boosting competitiveness. Furthermore, enhancing the digital transformation of SMEs through the use of new technologies and digital platforms may improve efficiency and market reach. It could also help in the development of innovative products and solutions in response to changing consumer demands and economic conditions.

Adding means putting numbers together to make a bigger number. Let's break it down into easy and fun steps. Step 1: Understand the Concept Adding is like having a group of things, and then getting more things to make a bigger group. Imagine you have three apples and your friend gives you two more apples. Now, you have five apples in total. That's adding! You just added 3 and 2 to get 5. You can always use toys, candies, or even your fingers to understand adding better! Step 2: Practice with a Small Number Now that you know what adding means, let's practice with small numbers. Start by adding 1 to other numbers: 1 + 1 = 2 (One plus one equals two) 1 + 2 = 3 (One plus two equals three) 1 + 3 = 4 (One plus three equals four) Keep going and see how the numbers become bigger when you add more! Step 3: Work Through All the Different Addend Combinations An \\"addend\\" is just a fancy word for the numbers you are adding together. Try adding different numbers together like 2 and 3, or 4 and 1. You can make a number chart to help you remember which numbers you have tried: For example: 1 + 2 = 3 2 + 3 = 5 3 + 4 = 7 4 + 1 = 5 Keep practicing with different addends and see how much fun adding can be! Step 4: Use Visuals, if Necessary Using visuals can help you understand adding even better. You can draw pictures, use stickers, or even make number lines! Here's an example with a number line: 1 + 2 = 1 [start here] → 2 → 3 [end here] So, 1 + 2 = 3! Adding numbers can be lots of fun when you understand the concept and practice with different numbers. You can even try teaching your friends and family how to add. The more you practice, the better you'll get at it.

The power of Congress to enact laws comes from the U.S. Constitution, specifically Article 1. The Constitution both grants certain powers to Congress and limits those powers, hence the phrase limited power. The powers granted to Congress can be categorized into two types: enumerated powers, which are directly mentioned in the Constitution, and implied powers, which are not specifically listed but are inferred from the enumerated powers. Enumerated powers include the power to levy and collect taxes, to coin money and regulate its value, to provide for the common defense and general welfare, to regulate commerce with foreign nations and between states, to establish post offices, etc. These powers are explicitly written in the Constitution. Implied powers are derived from the 'necessary and proper' clause in the Constitution. The clause states that Congress has the power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the U.S. government. This clause has been interpreted to give Congress considerable power to pass laws as needed to accomplish its constitutional duties. One aspect that limits these powers is the principle of federalism. Powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, not prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. This is according to the Tenth Amendment, part of the Bill of Rights. Further, although Congress can pass laws, it is also subject to checks and balances from the other branches of government. The President can veto legislation, and the Supreme Court can declare laws unconstitutional. Moreover, the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution's meaning, applying it to individual cases and controversies, thus sometimes influencing the legislative activity. The statement in question talks about a specific situation, where the courts interpret the laws and regulations created by Congress, under the principle of stare decisis (meaning to stand by things decided), which is the legal principle of determining points in litigation according to precedent. This principle ensures that legal decisions are predictable and not made arbitrarily, but it does not necessarily explain the limited power of Congress to enact laws."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They concluded that 24 per cent of young men in the 20 to 29 age group were obese - a significant rise on the previous estimate which was just eight per cent.

Immigrants are being granted permission to settle in Britain despite having ‘zero income and no employment’, a government inspector warned last night. The failure to carry out full background checks on the migrants undermines a key Home Office policy that applicants should be able to support themselves and their families without relying on the State. Foreign nationals who want to remain in the UK permanently are supposed to undergo strict checks by officials into their financial background. Scroll down for video. The chief inspector of immigration John Vine found potentially tens of thousands of applicants were approved without face-to-face interviews. As a minimum, they require enough money to pay for housing, plus a disposable income of more than £100 a week. But the chief inspector of immigration, John Vine, found potentially tens of thousands were having their applications rubber-stamped without either a face-to-face interview or HMRC investigation. An estimated one million migrants apply for permission to stay in the UK each year. But, incredibly, HMRC is willing to do only 3,000 checks a year for the UK Border Agency – just 250 every month. Such checks would establish if a migrant who claimed to be able to support themselves was telling the truth about their income or even having a job. As a result of the HMRC policy, officials are letting migrants stay without having had access to wages slips, P60 forms and other crucial data. Mr Vine, who carried out spot checks on a small sample of cases, said officials had granted permission to settle here despite the applicant having ‘zero income and no employment’. HMRC is only willing to do 3,000 checks a year for the UK Border Agency despite an estimated one million migrants applying for permission to stay in the country each year. He said the number of HMRC checks was ‘insufficient’ and must be urgently increased. Of 49 cases he looked at where. migrants were asking to stay on the grounds of marriage, not a single. person was interviewed. This is despite huge concern over sham. marriages. In other cases,. the application was decided while the husband or wife was still. overseas. Mr Vine said in one in every ten of such cases the decision. reached by immigration officials was ‘unreasonable’, mainly due to. insufficient evidence the migrant could afford to support themselves. The inspector raised his concerns in a report which focused on how UKBA handles cases involving marriage and civil partnerships. In. it, he also said there are currently more than 16,000 migrants waiting. to hear from border officials whether they can stay in Britain in yet. another ‘unacceptable’ UKBA backlog. Some. 14,000 applicants, growing at a rate of 700 a month, have already been. refused the right to stay but are pleading with officials to reconsider. An. additional 2,100 cases – shipped in a box from a UKBA office in Croydon. to Sheffield – are still waiting for an initial decision, some dating. back a decade. Mr Vine said: ‘This is completely unacceptable and I. expect the Agency to deal with both types of case as a matter of. urgency. John Vine said immigrants were being granted permission to settle despite having 'zero income and no employment' Ferry passengers caught entering Britain with cocaine in their luggage are being let off with just a small fine. Instead. of arresting and prosecuting, border officials are routinely. confiscating the drugs, allowing passengers to pay around £100 and then. letting them carry on their journey. John. Vine, chief inspector of Borders and Immigration, said the approach was. unlawful and anyone caught with Class A drugs should be put before a. court. His report into. border controls found two occasions where a small amount of cocaine was. discovered on a passenger or in their luggage coming into Dover via. Calais. Both cases involved less than 1g of the drug. Under. customs laws, passengers caught with small amounts of Class B and C. drugs can pay a ‘compound settlement’, have the drugs confiscated and. escape prosecution. But. that law does not extend to Class A drugs. Anyone caught entering with. even small amounts of heroin, cocaine or ecstasy must be arrested and. can face a lengthy prison sentence. The. report said: ‘Although the amount was small, we were concerned that in. one case investigators advised a compound settlement for the offence,. given that this was contrary to Border Force’s own guidance. ‘Border. Force subsequently informed us that they had revised their guidance to. reiterate that class A drugs fall outside the scope of compounding.’ ‘Delays also mean. enforcement action is likely to be more difficult in the event the case. is ultimately refused. This is because the individual will have been in. the UK for a number of years and may have developed a family or private. life.’ He also said the. percentage of successful appeals in marriage cases was too high, at 53. per cent from April 2011 to February last year. Mr Vine told Radio 4's Today programme this morning: 'Work is being transferred but missed or lost. The organisation should know what its own backlog and workload is, then it can prioritise. 'I was concerned at the high rate of appeal.' He admitted that 13 per cent of cases remained unresolved. Mark Harper, Minister of State for Immigration, told the show that the 14,000 outstanding appeals had not been done through the proper channels. 'We went and just allowed people to say, \\"can you just go through it again?\\" They should have given a clear message. 'We inherited an agency with a lot of problems.' Sir Andrew Green, of. Migration Watch, said: ‘This is yet further evidence of the chaos in the. immigration system.’ UKBA. said last night: ‘We are working with HMRC to increase the number of. searches we can do against their systems. Since this report we have. brought in strict new rules on proving income levels to make sure that. those bringing in family members are able to support them.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.

The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round. Which body of water had fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge ? Answer:","completion":"The Twin Lakes seemed to have distinct characteristics - with Twin I having cold water throughout the year and Twin II featuring warm waters. In order to fully address the question about which body of water had fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge, one must consider various factors such as water temperature, industrial waste composition and quantity, the surrounding ecosystem, and natural processes occurring within the lakes. Firstly, let's discuss the possible effects of water temperature. A major factor contributing to the eco-balance of any lake or river is its ability to absorb and break down industrial pollutants. Cold water, as exhibited by Twin I, generally has a lower capacity for dissolving substances compared to warm water (Twin II). This means that pollutants and waste could potentially accumulate more significantly in Twin I than Twin II. Cold water also tends to have less dissolved oxygen, making it harder for aquatic organisms to process and break down pollutants. On the flip side, warm water (such as in Twin II) generally supports higher levels of biological activity, which may aid in the decomposition and remediation of industrial waste. Considering the waste composition, the type and amount of pollutants discharged in the vicinity of Twin I and Twin II can have varying effects on each lake's ecosystem. For instance, if the industrial waste contains a considerable amount of heavy metals, the metals can adsorb to the sediment or become absorbed by aquatic plants, potentially posing more significant health risks in the colder Twin I due to lower dilution and mitigation capacities. However, if the industrial waste primarily consists of organic compounds, the warmer Twin II lake may suffer more due to eutrophication, a phenomenon wherein an excessive nutrient influx results in algal blooms, leading to oxygen depletion and subsequent harm to aquatic life. Furthermore, the surrounding ecosystem of the lakes plays a critical role in determining the effects of industrial discharge. The presence of vegetation such as wetlands or riparian buffers can help protect the lakes from harmful pollutants, acting as a natural filtration system. Additionally, these ecosystems are more resilient if they have a greater biodiversity and maintain a stable food chain. If either Twin I or Twin II have a more robust ecosystem and natural barriers to pollutants, it would experience fewer problems related to industrial discharge. Finally, the lakes' natural processes, such as seasonal temperature variations, water currents, stratification, and turbidity, could impact their ability to handle industrial waste. For example, if Twin I's cold waters experience temperature inversions and water turnovers more frequently, it may facilitate the better circulation and distribution of pollutants, thus lessening their impact on the aquatic life. Conversely, if the warmer Twin II lake remains stably stratified, it could lead to the segregation of temperature layers and hinder proper mixing or flushing of pollutants from the lake. Considering the factors mentioned above, it is challenging to provide a definitive and reliable answer to which lake had fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge without concrete information about the specific industrial pollutants, the quantity of waste being discharged, as well as the characteristics of the surrounding ecosystem, and natural processes occurring within the lakes. However, in a general sense, it is possible that Twin II, with its warm waters, may be better suited to naturally break down and dissipate some pollutants due to its increased capacity for biological activity and enhanced solubility of substances. Nevertheless, this must be weighed against the risk of eutrophication, which favors environments with higher levels of nutrients and biological activity. Comprehensive research and monitoring should be conducted on each lake to provide accurate and tailored assessments in terms of industrial discharge impact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to Miami to meet the Fockers in his new RV. Once they arrive, they are greeted by Greg's eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie (Hoffman), and mother, Roz (Streisand), who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. Worried that Jack may be put off by the Fockers' lifestyle, Greg convinces Roz to pretend that she is a yoga instructor for the weekend. Though Jack and Bernie get off to a good start, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. Things are made worse when a chase between the Fockers' dog, Moses, and the Byrnes' cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV's toilet, forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses. Later, Bernie accidentally injures Jack's back during a game of football. Meanwhile Pam informs Greg that she's pregnant, and the two decide to keep it secret from Jack. Jack again becomes suspicious of Greg's integrity and quality, when they are introduced to the Fockers' housekeeper, Isabel Villalobos (Alanna Ubach), with whom Bernie reveals Greg had a sexual affair fifteen years before. Jack later takes the RV to Isabel's fifteen-year-old son, Jorge (Ray Santiago), to fix the toilet, but is disturbed by Jorge's striking resemblance to Greg, and the fact that Jorge never met his father, and begins to suspect he may be Greg's son with Isabel. Meanwhile, Roz, Bernie and Dina realize Pam is pregnant, but promise not to tell Jack. Growing envious of Bernie and Roz's active sex life, Dina consults Roz on sex tips in order to seduce Jack, but none of them work. Things eventually come to a crunch when Greg... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Meet the Fockers,\\" Jack Byrnes, portrayed by Robert De Niro, is a retired operative from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As a former CIA agent, Jack is highly protective of his family and tends to be quite paranoid and suspicious, especially towards Greg Focker, played by Ben Stiller. The film's plot revolves around the engagement of Greg Focker and Pam Byrnes, with the couple planning to introduce their respective families. They fly to Oyster Bay, New York, to pick up Pam's parents, Jack and Dina (Blythe Danner), and her one-year-old nephew Little Jack. Instead of flying to Miami where the Fockers live, Jack decides to drive everyone there in his new RV. Upon arrival, they meet Greg's parents, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbra Streisand), who have eccentric personalities, with Roz being a sex therapist for elderly couples. Greg, growing concerned that Jack might not approve of his parents' lifestyle, convinces Roz to pose as a yoga instructor for the weekend. Throughout their visit, tensions rise between Jack and the Fockers as their contrasting personalities clash, leading to a series of mishaps, misunderstandings, and suspicion towards Greg's character. Additionally, Pam and Greg discover they are expecting a child, but they decide to keep it a secret from Jack. One notable incident involves the Fockers' dog and the Byrnes' cat engaging in a chase that results in Bernie having to destroy the RV toilet to save the dog. Further complications arise with the introduction of the Fockers' housekeeper, Isabel Villalobos, which prompts Jack to suspect that Greg fathered her son, Jorge.

CHAPTER II One evening Fru Astrida sat in her tall chair in the chimney corner, her distaff, with its load of flax in her hand, while she twisted and drew out the thread, and her spindle danced on the floor. Opposite to her sat, sleeping in his chair, Sir Eric de Centeville; Osmond was on a low bench within the chimney corner, trimming and shaping with his knife some feathers of the wild goose, which were to fly in a different fashion from their former one, and serve, not to wing the flight of a harmless goose, but of a sharp arrow. The men of the household sat ranged on benches on one side of the hall, the women on the other; a great red fire, together with an immense flickering lamp which hung from the ceiling, supplied the light; the windows were closed with wooden shutters, and the whole apartment had a cheerful appearance. Two or three large hounds were reposing in front of the hearth, and among them sat little Richard of Normandy, now smoothing down their broad silken ears; now tickling the large cushions of their feet with the end of one of Osmond's feathers; now fairly pulling open the eyes of one of the good-natured sleepy creatures, which only stretched its legs, and remonstrated with a sort of low groan, rather than a growl. The boy's eyes were, all the time, intently fixed on Dame Astrida, as if he would not lose one word of the story she was telling him; how Earl Rollo, his grandfather, had sailed into the mouth of the Seine, and how Archbishop Franco, of Rouen, had come to meet him and brought him the keys of the town, and how not one Neustrian of Rouen had met with harm from the brave Northmen. Then she told him of his grandfather's baptism, and how during the seven days that he wore his white baptismal robes, he had made large gifts to all the chief churches in his dukedom of Normandy. 1.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer the following question: Information: - A given name (also known as a personal name, Christian name, first name, or forename) is a part of a person's full nomenclature. It identifies a specific person, and differentiates that person from other members of a group, such as a family or clan, with whom that person shares a common surname. The term \\"given name\\" refers to the fact that the name usually is \\"bestowed\\" upon a person, normally \\"given\\" to a child by its parents at or near the time of birth. This contrasts with a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), which is normally inherited, and shared with other members of the child's immediate family. - Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as \\"The Unicode Standard\\", the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). , the most recent version is \\"Unicode 9.0\\". The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms. - A surname or family name is a name added to a given name. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many dictionaries define \\"surname\\" as a synonym of \\"family name\\". In the Western Hemisphere, it is commonly synonymous with last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name there. - In the German alphabet, the (traditionally lowercase-only) letter ß, called Eszett or scharfes S, in English \\"sharp S\\", is a consonant that evolved as a ligature of \\"long s and z\\" (z) and \\"long s over round s\\" (s). It is pronounced (see IPA). Since the German orthography reform of 1996, it is used only after long vowels and diphthongs while \\"ss\\" is written after short vowels. The name \\"Eszett\\" comes from the two letters S and Z as they are pronounced in German. Its Unicode encoding is U+00DF. - The long, medial, or descending s () is a form of the minuscule (lower-case) letter \\"s\\", which was formerly used where \\"s\\" occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word (e.g. \\"infulnes\\" for \\"sinfulness\\" and \\"uccesful\\" for \\"successful\\"). The modern letterform was called the \\"terminal\\", \\"round\\", or \\"short\\" s. - The German orthography reform of 1996 (\\"\\") was a change to German spelling and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language. - Strauss , Strauß or Straus is a common Germanic surname . Outside Germany and Austria Strauß is always spelled Strauss ( the letter \`\` ß '' is not used in the German - speaking part of Switzerland ) . The families using the Strauss name represent a genetically varied group of people of both Jewish and Germanic origin . The name has been used by families in the Germanic area for at least a thousand years . The overlord of Gröna for example , went by the name of Struz and used the image of an ostrich as his symbol . Examples of it could still be seen on the thousand - year - old church bell of that town . \`\` Struz '' or \`\` Strutz '' is the North - German form of the word \`\` Strauss '' , which is the modern German word for an \`\` Ostrich '' . Some of the earliest Jewish bearers of the name hailed from the Judengasse in medieval Frankfurt , where families have been known by the name of the houses they inhabited . All the houses had names and these included Haus Strauss , complete with an image of an ostrich on the façade . When , for tax purposes , Napoleon made surnames obligatory in 1808 , some more Jewish families decided to adopt the Straus ( s ) name . - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere. - A diphthong (or ; from Greek: , \\"diphthongos\\", literally \\"two sounds\\" or \\"two tones\\"), also known as a gliding vowel, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. In many dialects of English, the phrase \\"no highway cowboys\\" has five distinct diphthongs, one in every syllable. - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels. - An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language.

What is the cause?","completion":"There could be several causes for your mailbox overflowing with letters. Given the premise, let's consider and analyze a few possibilities: 1. Infrequent Mail Collection: One of the primary reasons for a mailbox overflowing with letters could be the infrequency of mail collection. If you have not been picking up your mail regularly or have been away from home for an extended period, the volume of mail can accumulate and result in an overflowing mailbox. 2. Address Mistake or Identity Mix-up: It's possible that some of the mail delivered to your mailbox was not meant for you. There can be instances where senders may have written the incorrect address, your address might be similar to someone else's or the mail carrier may have mistakenly delivered someone's mail to your mailbox. This error could add to your pile and eventually lead to an overflowing mailbox. 3. Subscription Services or Catalogs: If you have signed up for multiple subscription services, newsletters, or catalogs, it is possible that their simultaneous or excessive delivery could result in an overflow of mail in your mailbox. Many subscription deliveries happen monthly or weekly, and these can quickly fill up your mailbox if you are unable to keep up with their pace. 4. Seasonal Surge: There are times in the year when mail delivery can significantly increase, such as during the holiday season. During such times, your mailbox might experience a surge in deliveries due to special promotional materials, greeting cards, or gift packages. 5. Delinquent Account Notices: If you have any unpaid bills or pending account-related matters, you may receive multiple letters, invoices, or notifications from the associated organizations or companies. These may include utilities, bank statements, insurance companies, or other service providers that require your attention, which in turn could lead to your mailbox overflowing. 6. Political or Promotional Mail: During election seasons or other significant events, a large amount of political or promotional mail may be sent to you. These materials can contribute to an increased volume of incoming mail, which might result in an overflowing mailbox. 7. Spam or Unsolicited Mail: Lastly, your mailbox may overflow due to unsolicited mail or spam. This could include advertisements, marketing materials, and other promotional items sent without your consent. Companies often use mass mailings to reach as many people as possible, and this could increase your daily mail intake. To prevent an overflowing mailbox, it is essential to check and empty your mailbox regularly and manage your subscriptions or mailing preferences. Additionally, you can consider opting for paperless billing and communication options wherever possible, further reducing the volume of physical mail received. In rare cases, you might need to contact your local postal carrier or post office to report a mail delivery issue or request a hold on your mail during vacations or extended periods away from home. In conclusion, multiple factors can contribute to a mailbox overflowing with letters. These can range from personal habits and circumstances to systemic or administrative issues. By understanding these potential causes, you can take the necessary steps to maintain a manageable mailbox and avoid an overwhelming amount of mail."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The county seat of Suffolk County, NY lies at the mouth of a river that flows into which body of water? Answer:","completion":"The county seat of Suffolk County, New York is Riverhead. The town lies at the mouth of the Peconic River, which flows into the Peconic Bay. The Peconic Bay is a sizable body of water located on the eastern end of Long Island, in between the North and South Forks. The bay is further divided into smaller sections, including the Great Peconic Bay, Little Peconic Bay, and other smaller interconnected bodies of water. Overall, the Peconic Bay system forms an estuary that is fed by a number of rivers, including the Peconic River. The Peconic River originates from west-central Suffolk County, near Brookhaven National Laboratory, and flows eastward into Riverhead before it empties into the Flanders Bay, which forms part of the larger Peconic Bay system. The river, spanning about 15 miles, is the longest river on Long Island, and it is relatively unique as it flows from west to east, while the majority of the North American rivers flow southward or from the north to the south. Similarly, the Peconic Bay is one-of-a-kind, making part of an estuarine complex which is renowned for its outstanding aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. This wetland system constitutes a vital hub for numerous species of fish, shellfish, migratory waterfowl, and other types of wildlife.

After leaving Sesame Street, New York City, New York, Miss Finch brings Big Bird to the fictional town of Oceanview, Illinois to live with a family of dodos. The dodos all think very poorly of non birds, even saying he should have a bird as a best friend instead of Mr. Snuffleupagus (who is currently watching over Big Bird's nest). This causes him much distress. When Big Bird runs away from his new home and ends up on the news, Miss Finch tells Kermit the Frog that she will reclaim him.

Step 2: Assess the likelihood of someone willingly consuming a large amount of strychnine: - Strychnine is a well-known poison. - Its ingestion can lead to severe symptoms, including muscle contractions, seizures, and ultimately death. - In general, people would be unlikely to knowingly consume a potentially lethal dose of a poison. Step 3: Combine the information from Steps 1 and 2 and apply it to the hypothesis: - The premise suggests that she would have had to take nearly the whole bottle of strychnine. - It is unlikely that someone would knowingly consume such a large, dangerous amount of strychnine. - Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a strong likelihood that the hypothesis \\"There was no way she would have taken that much strychnine on her own.\\" is true.

The negative zero on the right side can be simplified to just 0, so the equation becomes: -9*u + 18 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable u To find the value of u, we need to isolate the term with the variable u on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll subtract 18 from both sides: -9*u + 18 - 18 = 0 - 18 This simplifies to: -9*u = -18 Step 3: Solve for u Now that the term with the variable u is isolated, we can solve for the value of u by dividing both sides of the equation by -9: (-9*u) / -9 = (-18) / -9 This simplifies, and we get the value of u: u = 2 So, the solution to the equation -9*u + 18 = -0 is u = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Premise: Other hands joined his to boost Anse. Hypothesis: He let Anse fall to the floor. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis \\"He let Anse fall to the floor\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"Other hands joined his to boost Anse.\\" To determine whether a hypothesis is entailed by a premise, we should examine the relationship between the information given in the premise and the proposed outcome in the hypothesis. In this particular situation, the premise states that other hands have joined together with someone to help boost Anse. This suggests that there is a collaborative effort to lift or support Anse in some manner. The act of \\"boosting\\" in this context generally carries a positive connotation, implying assistance and encouragement. On the other hand, the hypothesis proposes that someone let Anse fall to the floor. This statement's implication is contrary to the premise because it portrays a negative outcome where Anse is not supported or lifted but instead is allowed to fall. Allowing Anse to fall to the floor implies a failure or lack of support, which contradicts the collaborative effort to boost Anse mentioned in the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"He let Anse fall to the floor\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"Other hands joined his to boost Anse,\\" as the information in the premise does not imply or suggest the negative outcome mentioned in the hypothesis.

While money is the typical form of payment at many establishments, there are instances in which different items are exchanged or offered to a clerk. Analyzing the options provided - ticket booth, at a hotel, shop, bookstore, and post office - each specific location has unique characteristics and practices. 1. Ticket Booth: At a ticket booth, typically found at places such as movie theaters, amusement parks, and sports events, the primary purpose is to purchase entry to an event or attraction. Usually, payment is made in the form of money, either cash or card. However, there may be instances when vouchers, coupons, or complimentary passes are given to a clerk at the ticket booth as an alternative to money. These can be used to avail of discounts or as a way of gaining complimentary access to the event or attraction. In such cases, offering something other than money to a clerk at a ticket booth is appropriate. 2. At a Hotel: Hotels offer various services to their guests, often including accommodations, meals, and additional amenities. While most hotel payments are made with money or credit, there might be circumstances where guests redeem reward points, gift certificates, or voucher codes in exchange for products and services. These alternative forms of payment may be accepted by a hotel clerk and can result in paying for a hotel stay or accessing particular services without exchanging money. 3. Shop: In a retail shop, customers typically purchase goods or services with money. However, non-monetary exchanges can also occur through means such as the use of gift cards, store credits, or even bartering in specific situations. These practices, while not commonly expected, can lead to transactions where customers obtain desired products or services without directly paying with cash or card. 4. Bookstore: Similar to a retail shop, customers at a bookstore usually pay for their purchases with money. Nonetheless, alternative methods of payment or exchange can be employed in certain situations, such as redeeming gift cards, book vouchers, loyalty points, or even participating in a book exchange program. These alternatives might come into play when interacting with a bookstore clerk, enabling the acquisition of new reading material or services without a monetary transaction. 5. Post Office: At a post office, customers typically tend to pay for services such as mailing, shipping, and purchasing stamps with money. However, there are specific scenarios where alternative tools can be utilized, such as redeeming postage coupons or offering pre-paid postage material. In such instances, a clerk might accept an item besides money in exchange for the service provided by the post office. In conclusion, the best answer to the question, \\"Where would you give something other than money to a clerk?\\", cannot be specifically pinpointed to only one of the options provided. It ultimately depends on the circumstances and context that allow for alternative payment methods to be employed.

Two neighbors Paul and Dean studied toghether often. this week they got together and Paul started studying about the Gaia hypothesis, while Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Which person studied more about the carbon dioxide levels? Hint: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.","completion":"Based on the given information and hint, it can be inferred that Paul, who studied the Gaia hypothesis, likely studied more about the carbon dioxide levels. This is because the Gaia hypothesis emphasizes a self-regulating Earth, which includes maintaining a stable atmospheric composition and constantly adjusting to maintain the ideal conditions for life to thrive. One of the key aspects of the Gaia hypothesis is its focus on the relationship between the biosphere and the atmosphere. The example provided specifically mentions how the increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere leads to more rapid plant growth, resulting in the removal of more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to maintain a stable and consistent composition. On the other hand, Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which is primarily concerned with the concepts of space and time, as well as the relationship between energy and mass. While this theory has significantly impacted our understanding of physics and the universe, it does not directly relate to carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere or the self-regulation of Earth's systems. Therefore, Paul, who studied the Gaia hypothesis, delved deeper into the topic of carbon dioxide levels and their role in maintaining homeostasis within the Earth's biosphere. This is in comparison to Dean, who studied a subject not directly related to carbon dioxide levels or Earth's homeostasis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Earth Crisis is an American metalcore band from Syracuse, New York, active from 1989 until 2001, reuniting in 2007. Since 1993 the band's longest serving members are vocalist Karl Buechner, guitarist Scott Crouse, bassist Ian Edwards and drummer Dennis Merrick. Their third guitarist Erick Edwards joined the band in 1998. The band has released eight studio albums, three compilations, two live albums and six music videos. Context: Earth Crisis had a huge impact on both the hardcore punk music and its ideals. MetalSucks said: \\"For anybody who was not in the hardcore scene back then, it is hard to describe the impact they had or how controversial they were. You either loved them or hated them for bringing both metal and veganism into the hardcore scene\\". Sociologist Ross Haenfler stated in The Vinyl Factory that \\"Earth Crisis became the face of straight edge throughout the 1990s\\" through \\"the convergence of 'radical' animal rights activism, a more aggressive 'metalcore' sound, and hardcore crews\\", becoming \\"one of the most controversial bands in the scene's history.\\" Their albums Firestorm, Destroy the Machines and Gomorrah's Season Ends were particularly influential for the emerging metalcore genre. According to Andrew O'Neill, \\"Earth Crisis inspired a much more heavy metal sound in hardcore\\" and \\"the distinction between the two [genres] started to crumble\\" shortly after those records were released. To a large extent, Earth Crisis was responsible for the rising of vegan straight edge militancy in the mid- to late 90s, when veganism was rarely present in mainstream culture. Haenfler said that, while \\"earlier straight edge bands advocated vegetarianism - for example Youth of Today, Insted and Manliftingbanner\\", Earth Crisis \\"made animal rights (and environmentalism) central to the scene\\" as a \\"self-described 'vegan straight edge' band\\", \\"inspiring thousands of kids to give up animal products entirely.\\" They also spawned many activists in the scene because their message \\"imparted the sense of urgency in a way that nothing else that ever come before had\\", according to Peter Daniel Young. Some of their songs went on to be considered by some as anthems, such as \\"Firestorm\\" for straight edge and \\"Ultramilitance\\" for eco-terrorists. They also drew major media attention, having been featured and interviewed by CNN, CBS and The New York Times, while lead singer Karl Buechner was invited to address the Congress about teens and substance abuse. Question: Did they have influence on current culture? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Earth Crisis had a significant influence on current culture, especially in the music scene and ideas about animal rights and veganism. They played a big role in shaping the metalcore genre with their albums and inspired a heavier metal sound in hardcore music. They also helped make veganism and animal rights more central to the straight edge and hardcore punk scene, inspiring many people to adopt these beliefs. Their songs became anthems for different movements, and they gained attention from major media outlets, spreading their message even further. So, their influence can be seen in both music and social movements today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

You probably thought of Google. But Google wasn't always the name of the famous search engine. In fact, the original name was BackRub! BackRub was the name two graduate students gave to the new search engine they developed in 1996. They called it BackRub because the engine used backlinks to measure the popularity of Web sites. Later, they wanted a better name -- a name that suggests huge quantities of data. They thought of the word googol. (A googol is a number followed by 100 zeros.) When they checked the Internet registry of names to see if googol was already taken, one of the students misspelled the word by mistake, and that's how Google was born. Google is just one example of a name change in the business world. Many other companies have decided to change their names or the names of their products. Here are some more examples: Jerry Yang and David Filo, two young computer specialists, developed a guide to Internet content in 1994. They called it \\"Jerry and David's Guide to World Wide Web.\\" But they soon realized that this wasn't a very catchy name, so they searched through a dictionary and found a better one: \\"Yahoo.\\" Sometimes companies change their names because of the popularity of one of their products.

News article: Eight Canadians posted to Cuba have experienced mysterious symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and nose bleeds in recent months, but Global Affairs officials say they are still at a loss to explain what is causing them. The most recent incident affecting Canadian diplomats and members of their families took place in December. The person affected said they suddenly felt a wave of pressure. Symptoms reported by others have included headaches, dizziness, nose bleeds, loss of balance and sleeplessness. The symptoms reported by the Canadians have not been as severe as those reported by some Americans. While one person affected continues to experience headaches, Canadian officials said Wednesday there is no indication following medical testing that anyone has experienced permanent damage. Officials told reporters during a background briefing in Ottawa Wednesday they are in uncharted territory and have never seen anything like it anywhere else in the world. At this point, they said, they haven't ruled out anything, including foul play. The mysterious ailments, which have triggered speculation worthy of a spy thriller, appear to only be hitting Canadian and American diplomats posted to Havana, Cuba. U.S. media reported last year that U.S. authorities were investigating the possibility the diplomats and their families had been targeted by some kind of \\"sonic attack.\\" However, The Associated Press on Monday cited a new FBI report that said the U.S. has found no evidence sonic waves were used. U.S. officials told a congressional hearing Tuesday they are still working on several theories — including the possibility a virus was used. Canadian officials said there have been no reports of similar symptoms among staff of other embassies or among Cubans. Nor have there been any reports of unusual symptoms among the thousands of Canadian tourists who visit Cuba every year. The United States reduced the number of people posted to its embassy in response to the problems reported by 24 U.S. personnel and members of their families. However, Canadian officials said they have no plans to reduce staff at its embassy. While a small number of diplomats and their families have opted to return to Canada, others have been sent to replace them after being fully briefed. At the same time, the government has increased security measures around both the embassy and the residences of staff members. Among the aspects officials have been studying are infrasound, ultrasound and environmental factors. While doctors have determined that some of the symptoms could be produced by auditory trauma, they said there is no known sonic weapon. The U.S. government warns travellers to Cuba that embassy employees have been targeted by attacks and U.S citizens could be as well — particularly around the Hotel Nacional and Hotel Capri in Havana. The Canadian government is not planning to add a similar warning to its travel advisory. While the officials did not say it, adding a warning to a travel advisory can have significant repercussions for businesses like insurance companies and airlines. The first reported symptoms occurred in March 2017 but there was a cluster around May 2017 after the Canadian Embassy was approached by the American Embassy and it began to ask staff if they had experienced anything. Overall, 27 staff members or their family members went through a medical examination and eight received further followup medical treatment. The government is also doing baseline testing of those being posted to the embassy in Cuba, including those sent there temporarily, to allow them to determine if there are any future changes. While a number of American staff said they heard a high-pitched sound before they began experiencing symptoms, only one Canadian reported that kind of sound. The Canadians reported feeling the symptoms at their homes, rather than at the embassy. Officials said Cuban officials appear to be as puzzled by the strange symptoms as the Canadians and Americans. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Abigail Williams and Tracy Connor It's not just the U.S. State Department that is baffled by the health problems of diplomats who've worked in Cuba. The Canadian government said Wednesday it also has no idea who or what is behind the mysterious ailments. At a briefing in Ottawa, a Canadian official said eight of their citizens stationed in Havana, out of 27 tested, required medical care after reporting symptoms that ranged from dizziness and headaches to nosebleeds. Three diplomatic families left Cuba as a result, the official said. The United States says 24 Americans affiliated with the embassy in Cuba have reported similar symptoms and signs consistent with traumatic brain injury. The State Department recalled all nonemergency personnel in late September and has no plans to return them, straining ties with Cuba. Cuba has welcomed FBI agents to Havana to investigate. But officials told NBC News that the probe found no evidence of attacks. Additionally, some U.S. officials have questioned whether there's a single cause for the symptoms. The State Department says the phenomenon is real. \\"Is there any thought given to the fact that this is a case of mass hysteria? That a bunch of people are just being hypochondriacs and making it up?” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., asked during a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing on Tuesday. \\"Twenty-four people have had symptoms and findings consistent with what looks like a mild traumatic brain injury. The objective tests that were done were not ones that could basically be easily faked,” State Department Medical Director Dr. Charles Rosenfarb testified. \\"The findings suggest that this is not a case of mass hysteria,\\" he said. While officials in Washington initially theorized that the staffers and their family members were sickened by some kind of sonic attack, other possible culprits are under investigation. \\"I think there’s viral, there’s ultrasound, there is a range of things that technical experts are looking at,\\" Todd Brown, diplomatic security assistant director at the State Department, said during the hearing. \\"When you say viral, you are talking about somebody intentionally implanting a virus?\\" Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., asked. \\"That could be a possibility,\\" Brown said. Francisco Palmieri of the State Department told a Senate subcommittee it's \\"incomprehensible\\" that Cuba doesn't know who is behind alleged attacks that harmed U.S. and Canadian diplomats. KEVIN LAMARQUE / Reuters Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has now decided to ratchet up the inquiry and convene an independent panel known as an Accountability Review Board. At the hearing, Rubio grilled officials on why the board had not been set up earlier, in accordance with law. \\"The law very clearly requires that within 60 days of an incident, and 120 days at most, that an accountability review board be stood up and they did not do that until almost a year after the first reports of the attacks,” Rubio told reporters. \\"That’s unacceptable.\\" The Cuban government has vociferously denied any involvement in or knowledge of attacks on American and Canadian diplomats. \\"There is no evidence of any kind, not of the cause, not of the perpetrators, not of the origin, not of the motivations,\\" a Cuban foreign ministry official, Josefina Vidal Ferreiro, said Tuesday evening. \\"There is no evidence at all, not one piece of evidence.\\" Despite the lack of evidence, the State Department said it's \\"incomprehensible\\" that leaders in Havana don't know what made the Americans and Canadians sick. Rubio, an ardent critic of the island's Communist government, agreed. \\"We can say we don't know how it happened, we can even say we can't know for sure who did it,\\" he said. \\"But two things we know for sure: People were hurt, and the Cuban government knows who did it.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Canadian and US diplomats based in Havana, Cuba, have reported mysterious symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and nosebleeds, with no clear explanation for the cause.

As a result, people do not know they are infected, so they don’t go to the doctor for help. If chlamydia goes untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females. It may cause infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These infections may leave a woman unable to have children.","completion":"Based on the provided information, if it is found that they have chlamydia, the complications would likely be more severe for Patty than for John. Chlamydia often causes no symptoms, but Patty reported experiencing discharge (leaking of fluids) from her vagina, which is one of the symptoms of chlamydia mentioned in the hint. Untreated chlamydia can cause more serious problems in females, such as infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries, potentially resulting in difficulties in conceiving or carrying a pregnancy to term. Although the information provided doesn't mention specific complications for males, it is generally less severe for men compared to the risks faced by women when chlamydia goes untreated.

The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy. The answer to this question is:","completion":"World War I resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed for Bulgaria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They have been pondering about how to communicate with each other in a doomsday scenario when all the electronic devices would be useless. They connected their houses with three ducts. One of the ducts is filled with air; they called it channel A. Another duct is filled with water; they called it channel B. And the last duct is filled with iron; they called it channel C. They can now transmit sound with these channels of communication; in case, disaster strikes. Which channel would be faster, channel A or channel B ? Hint: In common everyday speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at 343 m/s in air; it travels at 1,480 m/s in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at 5,120 m/s in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (27,000 mph);[1] (about 35 times as fast as in air) which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions. A:","completion":"Based on the hint information, it is clear that sound travels faster in different mediums at various speeds. Step 1: Identify the different speeds of sound in the given mediums. The hint reveals that, in an average circumstance, the speed of sound is 343 m/s in air, 1,480 m/s in water, and 5,120 m/s in iron. Step 2: Compare the necessary mediums for the task. Speed of sound in air (Channel A) = 343 m/s Speed of sound in water (Channel B) = 1,480 m/s Step 3: Determine which is faster. The speed of sound in water (1,480 m/s) is faster than the speed of sound in air (343 m/s). Therefore, for John and Keith, sound would travel faster through channel B (water) than through channel A (air). Thus, in a doomsday scenario, they should ideally use channel B for quicker communication. However, if that's not possible, then channel A will work, though at a slower speed. Remember, this decision is based on the need for speed. Other factors (water evaporation, difficulty in sealing water channel etc.) might influence the final decision which is beyond the scope of the current task."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 05:49 EST, 16 May 2012 | UPDATED: 20:16 EST, 16 May 2012 Iran may have used a secret cable published by whistleblower website WikiLeaks to target and hang an alleged Israeli spy. The disturbing development emerged after the alleged spy, kickboxer Majid Jamali Fashi, was executed in Tehran on Tuesday for assassinating an Iranian nuclear scientist in 2010. Although WikiLeaks redacted the name of the intelligence source on a leaked US diplomatic cable, it published a description of him as 'a licensed martial arts coach and trainer', writing from Azerbaijan. Scroll down for video... Experts said they believe the US Embassy document could have raised","completion":"suspicions about Fashi, leading Iranian authorities to investigate him further, ultimately resulting in his arrest, trial, and execution. According to Iranian state media, Fashi confessed to being an Israeli Mossad agent responsible for the assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist. However, human rights organizations have questioned the validity of this confession, suggesting it may have been coerced under torture. The incident has raised concerns among international watchdogs about the potential consequences of publishing sensitive information without thorough redaction. While WikiLeaks has, in the past, brought to light various instances of government misconduct and secrets, it has also faced criticism for potentially endangering individuals' lives by inadvertently revealing their identities. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, defended the organization's redaction process, arguing that they have an impeccable track record of protecting sources in their releases. However, critics say that Fashi's case highlights the risks associated with disclosing sensitive information and call for stricter guidelines to prevent future incidents. Both Israel and the United States have denied any involvement in Fashi's case, but tensions continue to rise in the region as Iran struggles to maintain control over its nuclear program while facing mounting international pressure to abandon it. In response to this incident, human rights organizations, as well as some foreign governments, have called for an independent investigation into Fashi's arrest, trial, and execution, to determine if his due process rights were violated and whether the information published by WikiLeaks played an unduly influential role in the case. As the repercussions of this tragic turn of events continue to unfold, questions remain about the balance between transparency and the protection of individuals caught in the crosshairs of global politics.

(InStyle.com) -- When \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\" premiered on September 19, 1970, it was almost revolutionary: the first television series focused on an independent (read: unmarried) career girl. And Mary's wardrobe was a little bit revolutionary too -- working women across the country were quick to copy her colorful dresses and wide-legged pantsuits. To celebrate the iconic program's fortieth anniversary, InStyle takes a look back at five fashionable TV shows -- and characters -- that have influenced women's at-work style. \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' Mary Richards lived in wintry Minneapolis and therefore had no shortage of cute cold-weather staples, including double-breasted coats, knee-high boots, and that famous blue tam. But it was her 70s work-wear that most women sought: colorful scarves, two-piece suits, and bright, office-appropriate dresses. See all 10 shows that influenced women's at-work wardrobes \\"Dynasty\\" Okay, so the Carrington women weren't exactly your typical 9-to-5ers. Nevertheless, the big-shouldered, wasp-waisted creations worn by oil mogul Alexis (Joan Collins) and her longtime rival Krystle (Linda Evans) were popular enough with fans that the show spawned a signature fashion line, \\"The Dynasty Collection\\" which was designed by the show's costumer, Nolan Miller. \\"Ally McBeal\\" In 1998, shortly after the show's first season finale, Ally McBeal's disembodied head appeared on the cover of Time magazine along with the question, \\"Is Feminism Dead?\\" Despite the conclusions reached by that article (is it really fair to compare a fictional character to activists and thinkers like Susan B. Anthony and Gloria Steinem?), women do owe something to the flighty young lawyer played by Calista Flockhart: She almost singlehandedly made the workplace safe for bare legs, freeing us from the tyranny of mandatory pantyhose. 1.

Then a man opened the door for me, from the outside. He was about 6’3 with dreads about 12 inches long and weighed about 280 pounds. I ran out of the port-a-pot and jumped on the guy and gave him a hug and told him that I loved him and that he saved my life. I don’t know how he managed to open the door for me, but I definitely know that my 14 year old self owes that man my life. I’m not sure where he is in life, or what he’s doing, but I hope God is blessing him abundantly. It is definitely a funny story to tell my friends. Question: How strong is the man in dreads? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"The strength of the man with dreads cannot be accurately determined based solely on the given information. Physical strength is influenced by factors such as muscle mass, body composition, and overall fitness. From the details provided, the man was 6'3\\" tall, weighed about 280 pounds, and had 12-inch long dreads, but these factors alone do not provide enough information to accurately assess his strength. It can be assumed that the man possessed enough strength or knowledge to open the locked port-a-pot door from the outside, but it is important to note that the door may have had a simple mechanism or faulty lock that could have been easily opened even without significant strength. In addition, the situation was likely very stressful and heightened the emotions of the person trapped inside the port-a-pot, so their perception of the man's strength may be influenced by their extreme relief and gratitude toward the man who saved them. To accurately determine the man's strength, more information would be needed regarding his muscular development, training background, and any fitness-related accomplishments. It is possible that he was quite strong, but it is also possible that he simply had the knowledge and skills needed to open the locked door. Regardless, his assistance was very much appreciated by the person he helped, and the story serves as a lighthearted anecdote to share with friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After meeting her at an ice hockey match, he sets about winning her confidence until she is prepared to give him legal control over the sale. He completes the deal without her knowledge, puts the money from the sale in a safe deposit box, and then deliberately waits to be caught by the police. Gregory plans on getting a five-year sentence, with time off for good behaviour, and then collecting his loot when he is released. However, the judge makes an example of the uncooperative Gregory by handing down a ten-year term. Not wishing to spend so much time in jail, Gregory pays Victor Sloane, one of his associates on the outside, to help him escape. Almost immediately, things begin to go wrong. Fearing arrest, he is unable for the moment to recover the money from the safe. Sloane also now begins to demand more money, threatening him with violence, and Gregory is forced to retaliate. Gregory tries to get help from his fellow criminals, calling upon an established code that exists between them. But when his former associate Sloane is found dead – accidentally having choked to death on the gag Gregory placed in his mouth – they refuse to offer him any assistance, as he is now too \\"hot\\".

Article: If you hear the sound of a handset beeping in a bag or pocket, you could be forgiven for thinking that someone has received a text message. But nowadays there are so many different ways of messaging someone that it could spell the death of the traditional text as we know it. Text messaging, or texting, is the art of sending a short, electronic message between two mobile phones or tablets . Users pay a certain amount to send messages via SMS--short message service. But in the last few years, messaging in this way has been on the decline . The rise of smartphones and tablets has seen an increase in the use of instant messaging apps , which take the place of traditional texts. Using wireless Internet connections, people can send limitless numbers of IMs to their friends for very little cost. Unlike traditional mobile texts, the user usually only has to pay to download the app once, after which each message they send is free. Web developers soon _ . Instant messaging apps have become popular all over the world. WhatsApp in America and Europe, WeChat in China and Kakao Talk in South Korea are but a few which have attracted hundreds of millions of people, who use the apps to chat to their friends in real time. These apps allow people to send picture messages for free--something which previously was quite costly. Research company Informa said that almost 19 billion messages were sent per day using chat apps in 2012, compared with 17. 6 billion SMS texts.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Animals are an English rhythm and blues and rock band, formed in Newcastle upon Tyne in the early 1960s. The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic No. 1 hit single, \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", as well as by hits such as \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\", \\"It's My Life\\", \\"I'm Crying\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\". The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-orientated album material. The original Animals line-up of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler and Steel reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in December 1968 and re-formed in late 1975 to record again. Burdon later said nobody understood why they did this short reunion. They did a mini-tour in 1976 and shot a few videos of their new songs like \\"Lonely Avenue\\" and \\"Please Send Me Someone to Love\\". They released the album in 1977 aptly called Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted. The album received critical praise. Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demos at that time, which were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed together with Alan Price and a complete line-up, foreshadowing later events. All five original band members reunited again in 1983 for the album Ark and a world concert tour, supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards, Nippy Noya on percussion, Steve Gregory on saxophone and Steve Grant on guitar. The first single \\"The Night\\" reached #48 at the US Pop Singles and #34 at the Mainstream Rock Charts, also gaining success in Greece. They released a second single called \\"Love Is For All Time\\". The Ark tour consisted of about one-third material from the original 1960s and two-thirds material from Ark or other songs. The latter included the songs \\"Heart Attack\\", \\"No More Elmore\\" (both released a year earlier by Burdon), \\"Oh Lucky Man\\" (from the 1973 soundtrack album to O Lucky Man! by Price), \\"It's Too Late\\", \\"Tango\\", and \\"Young Girls\\" (later released on Burdon's compilation, The Night). On 9 September, they had their first show in New York at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center, the tickets for which sold out. A Wembley Arena concert followed on 31 December (supporting The Police) which was released on the Rip it To Shreds live album in 1984 after they had disbanded again. Their concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in Royal Oak, Michigan on 29 November 1983 was released on 27 February 2008, as Last Live Show. A film about the reunion tour was shot but never released.

He said there had to be a \\"fair and balanced\\" settlement with English MPs deciding on laws applying to England. But defeated SNP leader Alex Salmond warned against any delay in shifting powers to Scotland as he announced his decision to step down. \\"For me as leader, my time is nearly done,\\" he said. \\"For Scotland, the campaign continues and the dream shall never die.\\" Scotland's First Minister explained his decision to quit just hours after Scotland voted decisively to stay in the United Kingdom by 2,001,926 votes to 1,617,989 - about 55% to 45%. The vote is the culmination of a two-year campaign. Talks will now begin on devolving more powers to Scotland. BBC political editor Nick Robinson The people have spoken. Scotland has rejected independence. The result has been accepted by both sides. So that you might think is that. Not a bit of it. The fact that over 1.5m British citizens voted not to remain part of the UK, the fact that a majority in Scotland's biggest city - Glasgow - backed independence, the fact that the Westminster establishment briefly thought this vote was lost, is the reason for that. The leaders of the three UK parties are now promising significant constitutional change and not just for Scotland but for England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well. They have agreed on a timetable for giving more powers to the Scottish Parliament but are a long, long way from agreeing proposals. Read more from Nick Robinson. Mr Salmond said he was \\"immensely proud\\" of his Yes campaign and serving as Scotland's First Minister had been \\"the privilege of my life\\", but he conceded that the SNP would benefit from new leadership to take the process on. The party had \\"the opportunity to hold Westminster's feet to the fire on the 'vow' that they have made to devolve further meaningful power to Scotland,\\" he said. \\"This places Scotland in a very strong position.\\" But while he would continue to serve as MSP for Aberdeenshire East, he had decided to stand down after the party's annual conference in November. \\"We lost the referendum vote but can still carry the political initiative,\\" he said. \\"More importantly Scotland can still emerge as the real winner.\\" In a statement outside Downing Street Mr Cameron defended the decision to hold the referendum, saying it was right that the SNP's majority in Holyrood was respected. He said Lord Smith of Kelvin had agreed to oversee the process of devolving more powers over tax, spending and welfare to Scotland, with draft legislation by the end of January. Mr Cameron added that the rights of other people in the UK needed to be \\"respected and enhanced\\". He said he had long believed that a crucial missing part was England. He said \\"the millions of voices of England must be heard\\". The Leader of the Commons William Hague has been asked to draw up plans for what would be a fundamental change at Westminster - that only English MPs could vote on English matters. BBC deputy political editor James Landale The Downing Street constitutional declaration - as it will become known - marks the start of what potentially could be massive constitutional change. In particular, the prime minister has promised to give English MPs a greater say over legislation that affects England. He made clear this would cover the same issues over which Scotland will have greater control - tax, spending and welfare. And the changes will be agreed at the same pace with draft legislation by January. But David Cameron did not spell out the detail, leaving a policy vacuum that will now be filled by Conservative MPs and an army of constitutional experts and think tanks. Everything from a full English parliament to complicated plans for English grand committees will be discussed. The risk for the PM is that he loses control of this debate. Read more from James Landale Mr Hague insisted there was a \\"very clear commitment\\" to the Scottish reforms pledged by the three main UK parties, but he argued that the English question had to be resolved at the same pace. \\"I think it would be inconceivable to go ahead with a further important stage and measure of devolution to parts of the United Kingdom, without addressing this issue,\\" he told the BBC. \\"Of course it's been an anomaly for quite a long time now that Scottish MPs can vote on everything happening in England, but we the English MPs can no longer do so in Scotland, and indeed nor can the Scottish. \\"But it will become absolutely acute - it will become absolutely indefensible with further devolution - and I think people need to know at the time of the general election next May where we all stand on that, whether we've tried to reach an agreement, and if not, it's something they can decide on in the general election.\\" 'History made' BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the proposal to restrict voting rights for Scottish MPs could undermine a future Labour government - theoretically there could be a Labour PM who lacks a majority of English MPs so is unable to get health or education issues through parliament. But Labour leader Ed Miliband, arriving at his party's conference in Manchester, said he would not allow the moment \\"to be used for narrow party political advantage\\". Instead he announced plans for a full constitutional convention \\"rooted in our nations and regions... to ensure decisions are taken closer to the families and businesses\\". \\"These issues can no longer be fixed solely by politicians or prime ministers trying to shore up their position in their own party,\\" he said. \\"The people need to be given a voice too.\\" He did not comment on proposals for English-only votes in Parliament, instead calling for more powers to be devolved to regions within England. 'Rash promises' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was time for the \\"clammy grip\\" of Westminster and Whitehall to be released \\"so that communities, families, cities, towns and villages across the UK feel that they have more say over their destiny than is currently the case\\". Mayor of London Boris Johnson said the result was \\"a great day for Britain\\" and pressed the case for English devolution. \\"What is sauce for the goose has got to be sauce for the gander,\\" he added. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Owen Paterson, who was sacked by Mr Cameron as environment secretary in July, demanded an immediate recall of Parliament to debate a new constitutional settlement. He said it had been \\"completely unacceptable that right at the end of the campaign we have an ex-Labour leader (Gordon Brown) galloping off up to Scotland making some very rash promises of extensive new powers to the Scottish people - apparently with the endorsement of all three UK party leaders.\\" England's voice Conservative Bernard Jenkin said he supported English votes for English laws, but claimed Mr Cameron's \\"No\\" campaign had been \\"patronising, over bearing,\\" and had given very little clarity about the implications of independence - \\"just rather a lot of scare stories\\". Ex-Labour minister Frank Field urged the Labour leadership to come up with its own answer to the \\"English question\\" as soon as possible, warning that the party could not afford to drag its heels or be seen as \\"anti-English\\". UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was now time for a \\"constitutional convention to find out how a fair UK would work\\". \\"I think England needs a voice,\\" he said. \\"We've heard a lot from Scotland. The tail can't continue wagging the dog any longer. We must have English MPs voting on English only matters.\\" Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative MPs' 1922 Committee, said he could envisage parliament having English-only days - when English MPs vote on English matters. Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, he said a separate English parliament could be costly and bureaucratic, but one parliament could sit on different days of the week for different matters. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article discusses the aftermath of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, in which Scotland voted to remain a part of the United Kingdom. The result of the vote was approximately 55% for staying in the UK and 45% for independence. The leaders of the three main UK parties promised significant constitutional changes not only for Scotland but also for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. However, they were far from agreeing on the exact proposals. Following the defeat, SNP leader Alex Salmond announced his decision to step down, stating that the party would benefit from new leadership. Prime Minister David Cameron defended the decision to hold the referendum and promised devolution of more powers to Scotland, including over tax, spending, and welfare. He also emphasized the need for the voices of England to be heard, leading to discussions about English MPs voting on English matters. Leader of the Commons William Hague and several other politicians expressed support for these constitutional changes, arguing that they should be addressed at the same pace as devolution to Scotland. Labour leader Ed Miliband called for a full constitutional convention and for more powers to be devolved to regions within England. Meanwhile, UKIP leader Nigel Farage argued for a constitutional convention to find out how a fair UK would work and stressed the need for England to have a voice as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The film begins with Naomi Arkoff being taken by her father Carver Arkoff into the basement of their castle home in Rome, Italy, where there lies a rack. Carver ties Naomi to both ends of the rack and turns the wheel, hurting her. Carver claims that her punishment this time is for having a cell phone, which was against the father's wishes. After begging her father to let her go, Carver unties her, but warns her that the next time she has a cellphone in the house, her punishment is not going to be slow and painful. As she gets released, she runs off upstairs, strangely screaming: \\"I can run faster than you!\\" over and over again. The next afternoon, Carver comes downstairs into the dining room to be questioned by his wife Lisbeth about what he did to Naomi the previous night. They then encourage Carver's half brother Peter, who is mentally retarded, to have lunch with them, where Carver tells Peter that the lamb that they're eating was Sophia, who Peter had grown an affection with. When Naomi comes downstairs and finds out what's up, she gives her toy animal of a horse to him, which appears to cheer him up.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and...

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who served in the Senate from his appointment in 1964 until becoming Vice President in 1977? ? Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes. As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party. Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue. Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years. The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days. Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law. Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B.

Write highlights for this article: Stocks on key Asian exchanges dropped modestly early Monday on what is likely to be an eventful day in world markets, following Standard and Poor's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. In early Tokyo trading, the Nikkei index fell 124 points, or 1.3%. South Korea's KOSPI index slipped 1.6%. In Australia, the All Ordinaries index lost 0.7%. The Shanghai composite started 0.8% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 2.6% at the open. Similarly, U.S. stock futures fell around 1.7% in early electronic trading Sunday. The futures were the first U.S. gauge of investor sentiment following Friday night's downgrade, removing the United States' AAA status for the first time. They give an indication of how investors will react when regular-hours U.S. trading begins at 9:30 a.m. ET Monday. Besides the U.S. downgrade, investors are concerned about the debt crisis in some European nations, though actions on the part of the G7 and the European Central Bank Sunday helped to allay some of those fears. Financial representatives of leading industrial nations said they are committed to taking \\"all necessary measures to support financial stability and growth in a spirit of close cooperation and confidence.\\" They welcomed the \\"decisive actions taken in the U.S. and Europe\\" and \\"the additional policy measures announced by Italy and Spain to strengthen fiscal discipline and underpin the recovery in economic activity and job creation.\\" \\"We are committed to taking coordinated action where needed, to ensuring liquidity, and to supporting financial market functioning, financial stability and economic growth,\\" G7 finance ministers and central bank governors said in a Sunday night statement. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner had been expected to take part in a conference call with representatives of the other G7 nations to discuss the downgraded U.S. credit rating, a G7 official told CNN. The G7 nations are the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States. Similarly, the European Central Bank made a bid to calm markets Sunday. It said it would implement a bond-purchase program and welcomed announcements by Italy and Spain on new measures meant to reduce their deficits. It told the governments of those countries that a \\"decisive and swift implementation\\" of reforms is \\"essential.\\" The move represents an escalation in the official response to Europe's debt crisis, which is now more than a year old and until recently was contained to smaller economies like Greece, Ireland and Portugal. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde cheered the announcements. \\"I welcome the statements from the European Central Bank, from the leaders of Germany and France as well as from the G7, and their renewed commitment to take all necessary action in a coordinated way to ensure stability and liquidity in the financial markets. This cooperation will contribute to maintaining confidence and spurring global economic growth,\\" she said in a statement. Middle Eastern markets, the first to open since the downgrade, were sharply lower on Sunday. Israel's market temporarily halted trading at one point and finished down more than 6%, while the Dubai Financial Market General Index fell 3.7%. The General Index on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange was down more than 2.5%, while in Saudi Arabia, the Tadawul All-Share Index dropped nearly 5.5% in trading Saturday. U.S. officials are talking to a \\"wide range of investors\\" about the downgrade by the credit agency to try to \\"mitigate\\" any short-term negative impact from Friday's announcement, a Treasury official told CNN. Top Standard & Poor's officials said Sunday that the downgraded credit rating for the United States was both a call for political consensus on significant deficit reduction and a warning of possible further credit problems down the road. \\"We have a negative outlook on the rating and that means that we think the risks currently on the rating are to the downside,\\" said David Beers, the S&P global head of sovereign ratings, on \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" However, Beers said markets were reacting to the debt crises in some European countries and fears of a global economic slump, rather than the U.S. credit downgrade alone. John Chambers, the S&P head of sovereign ratings, told ABC's \\"This Week\\" program Saturday that it could take years for the United States to return to AAA status. \\"Well, if history is a guide, it could take a while,\\" Chambers said. \\"We've had five governments that lost their AAA that got it back. The amount of time that it took for those five range from nine years to 18 years, so it takes a while.\\" The agency's concerns \\"are centered on the political side and on the fiscal side,\\" Chambers said. \\"So it would take a stabilization of the debt as a share of the economy and eventual decline,\\" he said. \\"And it would take, I think, more ability to reach consensus in Washington than what we're observing now.\\" Both Beers and Bill Miller, chairman and chief investment officer at Legg Mason Capital Management, told the Fox program that they don't expect the U.S. downgrade to cause a spike in interest rates, one of the possible results of the higher risk now attached to U.S. debt. \\"I don't think we'll pay more in interest,\\" Miller said, calling the downgrade more of a symbolic event than an economic event. However, he warned of continuing market volatility in coming days driven by uncertainty. Rating agencies such as S&P, Moody's and Fitch analyze risk and give debt a grade that is supposed to reflect the borrower's ability to repay its loans. The safest bets are stamped AAA. That's where the U.S. debt has stood for years. Moody's first assigned the United States an AAA rating in 1917. Fitch and Moody's, the other two main credit ratings agencies, maintained the AAA rating for the United States after last week's debt deal, though Moody's lowered its outlook on U.S. debt to \\"negative.\\" A negative outlook indicates the possibility that Moody's could downgrade the country's sovereign credit rating within a year or two. U.S. Treasury officials received S&P's analysis Friday afternoon and alerted the agency to an error that inflated U.S. deficits by 2 trillion, said an administration official, who was not authorized to speak for attribution. The agency acknowledged the mistake, but said it was sticking with its decision. The administration official called it \\"a facts-be-damned decision ... Their analysis was way off, but they wouldn't budge.\\" Saturday, Gene Sperling, director of Obama's National Economic Council, criticized S&P's call. \\"The magnitude of their error and the amateurism it displayed, combined with their willingness to simply change on the spot their lead rationale in their press release once the error was pointed out, was breathtaking. It smacked of an institution starting with a conclusion and shaping any arguments to fit it,\\" he said. But Beers defended his agency's move on Sunday, telling the Fox program: \\"The underlying debt burden of the U.S. government is rising and will continue to rise over the next decade.\\" CNN's Tom Cohen, Kyung Lah and Mark Meinero contributed to this report. Highlights:","completion":"1. Stocks in Asia fell after the US credit rating was downgraded by Standard and Poor's. 2.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. feet,cheerleader,sport,uniform Generate a sentence using the above characters:","completion":"A majority of sports enthusiasts may not realize it, but stepping into the shoes of a cheerleader is a task that requires remarkable agility, endurance, and a deep understanding of the game. Being a cheerleader demands a far more considerable enthusiasm than just donning a colorful uniform and having the ability to move one's feet rhythmically. It's a role that carries its unique set of challenges and rewards, often overlooked in the broader landscape of sports. A cheerleader's role in any sport is highly significant, and their uniform is a vibrant reflection of their team spirit and identity. Unfailingly bright, coordinated, and perfectly accessorized, the cheerleader uniform is much more than an ensemble; it's a sportswear specifically designed to accommodate agile moves and daring stunts. It's an embodiment of the dynamic energy and optimistic ethos that a cheerleader brings to a game. Made to be comfortable and allow freedom of movement, the uniform enables cheerleaders to perform their high-energy routines, all the while flaunting their team's colors and logos. The uniform, thus, symbolizes identity, team spirit, resilience, and undying enthusiasm. It encapsulates the powerful aesthetic that cheerleading brings to sports. Its importance is such that many sports teams invest significant resources into making these uniforms visually impressive, resonating with their audience, be it in basketball, football, or any other popular team sport. One of the primary tasks of a cheerleader during the game is to move - through coordination, grace, and rhythm. The feet play a crucial role in this. They should be swift enough to carry the cheerleader's weight through various routines, from simple toe-touch jumps to complex gymnastic tossing or tumbling sequences. Moreover, cheerleading often involves a series of lifts and human pyramids where the solid positioning of the feet is a matter of safety and efficiency. So, the feet's function in cheerleading is paramount; it provides rhythm, balance, speed, and most importantly, safety. Being a cheerleader in the world of sports is not merely about looking glamorous in a uniform or mastering the movements of one's feet. It's about portraying the spirit of unity, building an atmosphere of positivity, rallying the crowd, and supporting the team. It's about embodying resilience, enthusiasm, discipline, athleticism, and a great love for the game in equal measure. Thus, cheerleading is not just a sideshow to the main game; it's equally as essential and integral to the sport as the athletes themselves. They are the ones who set the stage for the players, amplify the crowd's emotions, celebrate team's success, and even offer solace in defeat by always staying optimistic and hopeful. Cheerleaders, with their vivacious uniforms and nimble feet, bring joy, color, and spirited aesthetics to sports, making the competition not just a game, but an all-encompassing spectacle of human endeavor, resilience, and unity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Article: Traffic problems are an everyday concern in many cities,including Washington,DC.A growing number of Washingtonians are turning to bicycles to get to and from work.In fact,the number of commuters who use bicycles has doubled in the city since 2007. Ralph Buehler teaches urban planning at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,popularly known as Virginia Tech.He has written a book about urban biking,called \\"City Cycling\\". He says there is a reason why urban bike tiding is now becoming more popular. \\"Over the last 60 to 70 years.cities in the U.S.have been adapted to the automobile.\\" \\"Most cities took advantage of the money coming for the interstate highway system,from the federal government,starting in 1956.There was a 90 percent federal match so the cities only had to put up 10%.It was very tempting.\\" In the years after World War Two,many Americans moved to suburban communities,just outside major cities,They decided to travel great distances to and from work in exchange for a home in the suburbs.Their cars became a symbol of freedom. But today,many people believe they can save money by living in the city. Greg Billing is with the Washington Area Bicyclist Association.\\"When a person makes a change from 04 using a car to using a bike,they are saving anywhere between 8 or9,000 a year.\\" Ralph Buehler says governments save money when people use bicycles.\\"Building bicycling facilities is much cheaper than building and maintaining road facilities or public transport.\\" Washington,DC has also taken steps to protect bike riders.It approved a safe passing law and created areas on the road between cars and bikes. The United States Census Bureau says 4%of the city's workers ride to work by bike.The only city on the East Coast with more bike commuters is New York. Question: What's the best title of the text?

Israeli police arrested two suspects Saturday in connection to a deadly wildfire raging in the country's north, though a police spokesman said it appears the fires started out of negligence. The fires have killed 41 and injured 17 others. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the suspects are being questioned at a local police station but police now believe the fires were due to negligence rather than arson. As the police probe unfolded, firefighters continued to battle three major blazes fueled by shifting winds. The fire, the worst in Israel's history, is still not under control, Rosenfeld said. The flames spread over 10,000 acres around Haifa, Israel's third largest city, threatening businesses, tourism and one of Israel's greenest regions, Mount Carmel. \\"If you look over the hills at Haifa, you can see smoke billowing over the sea,\\" said Rosenfeld, adding that the winds have forced authorities to close down roads to the coastal area. About 17,000 people have been evacuated, but residential areas are not under threat, he said. On Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the help Israel received from other nations, including Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, as \\"heartwarming,\\" the Jerusalem Post reported. \\"One thing is clear, the Israeli people are standing together and many, many countries are together with Israel. This is no small thing,\\" Netanyahu said during a press conference. \\"This is surely a point of light in this our festival of lights Hanukkah,\\" he said. Israeli's military noted in a statement Saturday that firefighters from Bulgaria and Greece had joined Israeli personnel on the blaze's frontlines. Netanyahu's office said that so far, several nations have committed 10 airplanes and three helicopters to help Israel fight the raging fire, including four from Greece, one from Cyprus, two from Turkey, two from Russia and one from France. These are in addition to several Israel Defense Forces aircraft, including two to four charged with surveying the region from above. British Prime Minister David Cameron instructed the Royal Air Force to deploy two helicopters from Cyprus to help put out the fire, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Friday. Netanyahu spoke Saturday morning with the president of Switzerland to recruit additional air support, his office said. Five U.S. Defense Department aircraft will leave for Israel this weekend to help fight the fire. They include three C-130 firefighting aircraft from the U.S. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard and two C-130s from the U.S. European Command, which will depart Ramstein Air Base in Germany carrying 20 tons of fire retardant, the U.S. Agency for International Development said. The agency said it has already chartered commercial aircraft to deliver 45 tons of fire retardant and 12,000 liters of foam to suppress the flames. A team of experts from the U.S. Forest Service's Disaster Assistance Support Program is also heading to Israel, the agency said. Hague expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and to the thousands who have had to be evacuated because of the blaze. \\"This tragedy is all the more sad as it comes as the Jewish community around the world celebrates Hanukkah, a time of hope and joy,\\" Hague said. \\"The UK will continue to do whatever it can to help.\\" Two funerals took place Saturday after another eight were held Friday for those killed, Rosenfeld said. Most of the 41 victims were cadets in Israel's prison service who arrived Thursday to help evacuate 500 inmates from the Damon prison near Haifa. Among the dead, 40 were apparently burned alive when their bus, traveling along a narrow mountain road, was engulfed by the fast-moving blaze, the Jerusalem Post reported. In an interview with the newspaper, a firefighter spokesman said the bus was gone in less than three minutes. \\"The bus had no chance. They tried to escape but were burned alive,\\" the spokesman said. \\"It was a horrific scene.\\" The IDF said the victims will be buried with full honors in military ceremonies. Israeli firefighter spokesman Yoram Levy said shifting 29 kph (18 mph) winds made the inferno harder to control as flames neared a neighborhood in Haifa, a major tourist destination on the northern coast. Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel about 50 miles north of Tel Aviv, Haifa's metropolitan area is also host to historical sites that date to Biblical times. The fire has also threatened a sensitive ecological area near the Hai Bar nature reserve. Known as Mount Carmel's \\"Little Switzerland,\\" the reserve is home to a wildlife preservation project that seeks to bring back native species mentioned in the Old Testament. Though Israel is known for its military might, it has been criticized for failing to properly handle the blazes. CNN's Paul Colsey contributed to this report.

Herbert Alexander Simon (June 15, 1916 - February 9, 2001) was an American economist and political scientist whose primary interest was decision-making within organizations and is best known for the theories of \\"bounded rationality\\" and \\"satisficing\\". He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 and the Turing Award in 1975. His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science, computer science, public administration, management, and political science. He was at Carnegie Mellon University for most of his career, from 1949 to 2001. Simon was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, creating with Allen Newell the Logic Theory Machine (1956) and the General Problem Solver (GPS) (1957) programs. GPS may possibly be the first method developed for separating problem solving strategy from information about particular problems. Both programs were developed using the Information Processing Language (IPL) (1956) developed by Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Simon. Donald Knuth mentions the development of list processing in IPL, with the linked list originally called \\"NSS memory\\" for its inventors. In 1957, Simon predicted that computer chess would surpass human chess abilities within \\"ten years\\" when, in reality, that transition took about forty years. In the early 1960s psychologist Ulric Neisser asserted that while machines are capable of replicating \\"cold cognition\\" behaviors such as reasoning, planning, perceiving, and deciding, they would never be able to replicate \\"hot cognition\\" behaviors such as pain, pleasure, desire, and other emotions. Simon responded to Neisser's views in 1963 by writing a paper on emotional cognition, which he updated in 1967 and published in Psychological Review. Simon's work on emotional cognition was largely ignored by the artificial intelligence research community for several years, but subsequent work on emotions by Sloman and Picard helped refocus attention on Simon's paper and eventually, made it highly influential on the topic. Simon also collaborated with James G. March on several works in organization theory. With Allen Newell, Simon developed a theory for the simulation of human problem solving behavior using production rules. The study of human problem solving required new kinds of human measurements and, with Anders Ericsson, Simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis. Simon was interested in the role of knowledge in expertise. He said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly 50,000 chunks of information. A chess expert was said to have learned about 50,000 chunks or chess position patterns. He was awarded the ACM Turing Award, along with Allen Newell, in 1975. \\"In joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years, initially in collaboration with J. C. (Cliff) Shaw at the RAND Corporation, and subsequentially [sic] with numerous faculty and student colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University, they have made basic contributions to artificial intelligence, the psychology of human cognition, and list processing.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Were these programs used by others later on?","completion":"The text does not provide specific details about whether the programs developed by Herbert Alexander Simon, such as the Logic Theory Machine (1956) and the General Problem Solver (GPS) (1957), were directly used by others later on. However, Simon's influence on the fields of cognitive science, computer science, and artificial intelligence is well established, suggesting that his work, including the programs he helped develop, have had a significant impact on subsequent research in these fields. His development of the Information Processing Language (IPL) with Allen Newell and the linked list, known as \\"NSS memory,\\" are significant contributions to list processing and program development. Simon's input into the development of artificial intelligence suggests his programs' methodologies and principles have likely been utilised or built-upon in subsequent AI explorations and developments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Where may be the narrator heading next amid this pain ?","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is difficult to definitively determine where the narrator may be heading next amidst their pain. However, given the context, it is possible to suggest a few potential scenarios that may take place as a result of the ongoing pain they are experiencing. Here are a few possibilities: 1. Visiting a doctor or medical professional: The most likely next step for the narrator could be to consult with a doctor, nurse, or other medical professional to address and diagnose the pain they have been experiencing. This would allow them to receive professional guidance on how to manage and treat their pain effectively, ultimately improving their quality of life. Additionally, a medical professional could discern if there are any serious underlying issues at play that may be contributing to their pain. 2. Seeking pain management options: If the narrator has not already done so, they may be considering investing time into researching and exploring various pain management techniques to alleviate their discomfort. This could include over-the-counter medications, prescription painkillers, or alternative methods like physiotherapy, acupuncture, chiropractic care, and massage therapy. Ultimately, they might be seeking ways to gain more control over their pain and improve their overall well-being. 3. Exploring lifestyle adjustments: The narrator may be reflecting on their current lifestyle and contemplating possible changes that could help alleviate their pain or prevent it from escalating. This could involve improving their diet, incorporating gentle exercise routines, adjusting their sleep habits, or practicing relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep breathing exercises. By identifying potential lifestyle factors that could be exacerbating their pain, the narrator may be able to make meaningful adjustments to lessen their discomfort. 4. Discussing their situation with friends or family members: Another possible direction the narrator might take is sharing their pain experiences with close friends or family members. This could provide emotional support and help them navigate their way through the challenges that living with chronic pain can present. They may gain helpful insights from others who have faced similar circumstances or receive recommendations for reputable healthcare providers, treatments, or support groups. 5. Reevaluating their daily activities: The narrator might assess their daily activities to determine if any specific actions are contributing to or exacerbating their pain. Identifying and modifying these activities could lead to decreased pain levels and increased comfort throughout the day. Of course, these possibilities are merely speculative, as the narrator's next steps would ultimately depend on their individual situation, preferences, and access to resources. And while it is unclear precisely where they may be heading next, one thing remains certain: addressing and managing their pain will likely be a priority as they strive to improve their quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It can be much more convenient to just send the email or phone number through the phone. Or, you may have to contact the politician in person.. b). Write down the number as a general rule: the web host, or government department, will likely want to know from whom the contact information was forwarded.

Gov website to search all types of government for contact information. Explanation: a) This answer is incorrect because it suggests sending an email or phone number through the phone, which does not make sense. Lobbying politicians typically requires more formal ways of communication. b) This answer is wrong because it talks about forwarding contact information and contacting the national democrat for politics website, which is unrelated to lobbying politicians. c) This answer is not correct since it describes checkboxes and posting announcements on websites, which is irrelevant to lobbying politicians and finding their contact information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They both took good care of their properties. and a hint : In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

After the game ends, Papale goes home and finds out that his wife Sharon is upset with his alleged failure to provide proper support. The next morning, Papale goes to the high school where he works as a substitute teacher. In a short, unexpected meeting with the principal, he is told of his layoff. Later in the day, there is a report that the Eagles have hired a new head coach named Dick Vermeil as shown in a formal televised conference. That night, Papale goes to the bar where he works as a part-time bartender. The bar contains die-hard Eagles fans, who are watching TV about the hiring of Vermeil. The news story concludes with the announcement by Vermeil that he is staging open public tryouts for the Eagles. The men in the bar encourage Papale to go to the tryout.

Movie title: Public Enemies Movie plot: The film opens in 1933 as John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) is brought to the Indiana State Prison by his partner John \\"Red\\" Hamilton (Jason Clarke), under the disguise of a prisoner drop (with Dillinger posing as the prisoner). Inside the prison, several gang members, Charles Makley (Christian Stolte), Harry Pierpont (David Wenham), Ed Shouse (Michael Vieau), Homer Van Meter (Stephen Dorff), and Walter Dietrich (James Russo) acquire guns smuggled into the prison inside boxes of thread sent to the prison's shirt factory, with which they take a few guards hostage and march them to the changing rooms. At the same time, the warden that meets Dillinger and Hamilton suddenly recognizes Dillinger. Dillinger admits to his identity, and at this point, he suddenly springs his handcuffs off, and he and Hamilton conjure shotguns and force the warden to open the door to the break room at gunpoint, at the moment that the other inmates come in. They force the guards to take off their uniforms at gunpoint. Everything goes as planned until Shouse suddenly beats a guard to death in a fit of rage and another guard gets shot. A running shootout ensues as the men run towards the waiting car. Unfortunately, a sniper on the wall shoots Dietrich in the back just as he is about to get into the car, mortally wounding him, and a furious Dillinger kicks Shouse out of the car.In East Liverpool, Ohio, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) and several other FBI agents are running down Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum).

The local police officers recognize Dillinger and the other gang members from their wanted posters and manage to apprehend them. Later, Dillinger is extradited to Indiana and held at the Lake County Jail in Crown Point. The film is directed by Michael Mann and tells the story of John Dillinger, a notorious American bank robber and Public Enemy Number One during the Great Depression era. As you mentioned, the plot revolves around Dillinger and his gang's crime spree, as well as the pursuit of Dillinger by FBI Agent Melvin Purvis, played by Christian Bale. Public Enemies offers a mix of action, drama, and engaging performances, especially from Johnny Depp as John Dillinger. The film received generally positive reviews, with many critics praising Depp's portrayal of Dillinger and the movie's realistic portrayal of the 1930s era. However, it's essential to consider a few factors before deciding to invest in a film: 1. The overall budget and potential return on investment: Public Enemies had a budget of around 100 million. It earned approximately 214 million at the box office worldwide, making it a profitable, but not an overwhelming success. Investing in similar projects may offer reasonable returns, but they can be risky due to the high production costs. 2. The market for period dramas: Movies set in historical periods such as Public Enemies can garner interest from audiences craving authentically portrayed settings and characterizations, bolstering the film's chances at the box office. However, the relevance of this particular historical era and its appeal to contemporary audiences should also be taken into account. 3. The filmmakers and actors involved: Michael Mann is an acclaimed director known for movies like Heat and Collateral. Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are both A-list actors who attract large audiences. Their involvement in future film projects could be favorable for potential investors. 4. The competition: Analyzing the movie landscape during the time of production and release is essential. Public Enemies was released in the summer of 2009 amidst films like Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. Significant competition can affect the potential success of a project, making in-depth research on the expected release window crucial. Taking all of these factors into consideration, you may decide if investing in a film proposal similar to Public Enemies would be worth it. While the film itself garnered positive reviews and was profitable, it's essential to thoroughly research and analyze the specific details of the project you are considering before making any financial commitment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I refuse to use a white stick and hate asking for help, and I couldn't bear people to look at me and think I am not like them. I must be a terrible danger on the roads. Coming across me wandering through the traffic, motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes. Apart from that, there are all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work. One evening, I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses, and as usual I ran into something. \\"I'm awfully sorry,\\" I said and stepped forward only to run into it again. When it happened a third time, I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost. This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me. So I carried on and found the bus stop, which was a request stop, where the bus wouldn't stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off. No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived. Generally in this situation, because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help, I tried to guess at the sound. Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away. In the end, I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help. But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop; it seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus. Of course I heard plenty of buses pass, or I thought I did. But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself, I let them all go by. I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one. Then I gave up. I decided to walk on to the next stop. Question: What was the problem with guessing at the sound to stop a bus? Options: A: All cars have exactly the same sound. B: No bus would stop to pick up a blind girl. C: Some lorries may have the same sound as that of the bus. D: It took long for the girl to recognize the sound of a bus. The answer to this question is:","completion":"C: Some lorries may have the same sound as that of the bus. The problem with guessing the sound to stop a bus is that there may be other vehicles, like lorries, that could produce a similar sound. This can make it difficult for the girl to accurately distinguish between the sounds of a bus and other vehicles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire, Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London, and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century. Now answer this question: Who witnessed first-hand and wrote about the Great Fire of 1666?","completion":"The Great Fire of 1666 in London was witnessed first-hand and written about by Samuel Pepys. He was an English naval administrator and Member of Parliament who is most famous today for the diary he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. His diary provides valuable first-hand accounts of key events in London's history, including the infamous Great Fire. The Great Fire of London was a major conflagration that swept through the central parts of London from Sunday, September 2nd, to Wednesday, September 5th, 1666. Samuel Pepys’ diary entries from this time provide one of the most vivid primary sources about the fire, with his personal observations and experience of these catastrophic days. Pepys was awakened in the early morning of September 2nd, 1666, by his maid who had spotted a fire in the distance. Initially underestimating the seriousness of the fire, he went back to sleep. However, as the situation worsened, Pepys became more alert and involved, and he began his narrative about the Great Fire in his diary. In his accounts, Pepys described the chaos in the streets, the futile attempts to halt the fire’s progress, and the final toll it wreaked upon the city. He noted the destruction of landmarks, the displacement of residents, and even the change in atmosphere caused by the smoke and flames. It is to his observations that we owe much of what we know and understand about the historical event of the Great Fire of London. His chronicle provides an invaluable and vivid portrait of London before and after the fire, offering key insights into the lived experience of those cataclysmic days. Despite the passing of centuries, Pepys' account retains a raw vividness and visceral immediacy, reinforcing its value to historians, literary scholars, and anyone interested in this defining moment of London's past."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I was 35 weeks pregnant when I had my stroke. For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER.

Solve -2837*v - 11060 = 3125 for v.","completion":"Sure, I'll be happy to help you solve this, just like we would solve a simple subtraction problem! So, in the equation -2837*v - 11060 = 3125, we are trying to find out what value 'v' should be. To solve it, we first get rid of the -11060 from the left side by adding 11060 to both sides of the equation. When we do this, the equation now reads: -2837*v = 3125 + 11060. 3125 + 11060 equals 14185. So now the equation reads: -2837*v = 14185. Finally, we will get 'v' alone by dividing both sides by -2837. So, it will look like this: v = 14185 / -2837. When you divide 14185 by -2837, you get approximately -5. So, v = -5.

Process: - A type of coal must be chosen before the heating can start - The coal is broken down to a smaller material - The coal particles mix with hot air and move in to a boiler - Water in the boiler is pumped and produces steam with the coal - Steam powers turbine blades, which magnetically charge wire coals - The water returns back in to its chamber and the process is repeated - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose no heating occurs happens, how will it affect not heat will occur. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"In the process described above, coal is utilized as a fuel source to generate heat, which ultimately leads to the production of electricity. To further understand the perturbation hypothesis mentioned, we need to analyze the process step-by-step and discuss the potential effects if no heat is produced during the procedure. 1. Coal Selection: Before the actual heating process can begin, a specific type of coal must be chosen based on its heat generation ability, carbon content, and other factors such as the presence of impurities and environmental impact. The absence of heat generation would have a direct impact on the coal selection criteria. 2. Coal Preparation: The chosen coal is broken down into smaller, more manageable particles. This process is essential because it ensures better mixing with hot air and more efficient combustion. If there is no heat generation, the coal preparation step would still continue, but it would not significantly contribute to the process's overall efficiency. 3. Coal Combustion and Hot Air Mixing: The coal particles mix with hot air and are transported to a boiler. Normally, the coal particles are heated or burn in the presence of oxygen in the air, releasing heat energy. If no heat is produced during this step, this implies that the combustion of coal does not occur, which is a significant deviation from the regular process. 4. Steam Production and Power Generation: The heat generated by the coal combustion heats the water in the boiler, producing high-pressure steam. The steam then drives turbine blades, causing them to rotate and magnetically charge wire coils, consequently generating electricity. No heat generation would mean that the water in the boiler would not turn into steam, and no electricity would be generated since the turbine would not operate. 5. Water Recirculation: After going through the process, the steam loses heat, condenses back into water, and returns to the chamber to be heated again. In the absence of heat generation, the water would not undergo the entire process and would not need to be recirculated. 6. Overall Impact: If no heating occurs during the process, this means that there is no combustion, which can happen due to inappropriate coal choice, lack of oxygen, or malfunction in the heating system. This perturbation would have a direct impact on the process since it disrupts the entire heat-based power generation system, leading to no electricity production. The boiler, turbines, and generator would remain inactive, and the system would require troubleshooting for potential errors or malfunctions. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation hypothesis, \\"suppose no heating occurs,\\" would significantly impact the process. Since heat generation is a fundamental aspect of coal-based power generation, the absence of heat would directly affect the efficiency and functionality of the system, leading to no electricity production. It is essential to ensure that all components of the system are working correctly and that the chosen coal is suitable for heat generation. Otherwise, costly disruptions in electricity production may occur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Boston woman stops man who allegedly flashed her on train A Boston woman single-handedly grabbed a man by his collar and held him until police arrived after she says he exposed himself to her on a crowded Boston train during Thursday’s commute, MyFoxBoston.com reported. The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she tried to move away from Michael Galvin, the accused flasher, but he followed her. She told the Boston Herald that she zoned out, listening to music, only to look up and see him standing over her. “I looked up and felt awkward, so I looked down,” she said. She said the man was exposing and touching himself, but tried to cover himself with his shirt. The woman, 24, yelled, but fellow passengers did not react, she said. So she said she went into “She-Hulk” mode and lunged off the train at the man, held him by his sweat shirt and called police. “I don’t know how I held on to him,” she said. “Because he really tried to pull away and I was just holding on with one hand.” The alleged flasher told the woman that he’s sick and needs help, she said. The Herald reports that the man told police that his shorts fell off because of the “packed and jostling” trolley, according to a police report. He reportedly told police that he was unaware he was exposed until the woman started screaming. Galvin was charged with open and gross lewdness. He was released on his own recognizance and is scheduled to be back in court on May 30. He faces up to three years in prison if found guilty. Click here for more on this story from The Boston Herald.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose thee is no baby bird happens, how will it affect baby bird is cared for until it is an adult bird. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if there is no baby bird, it will have an impact on the subsequent steps in the process of a bird's life cycle. To analyze the effects, let's examine each step: 1. A bird hatches from an egg: Since there is no baby bird in this scenario, there isn't an egg hatching to begin with. This eliminates the starting point for the entire process. 2. The bird is nurtured by its parents: With no baby bird to nurture, the parents will have no reason to care for or protect an offspring. This means that this step will not happen as well. 3. The bird is fed food for growth: Since there is no baby bird to feed, the parents will not bring food and the growth-related feeding will be nonexistent. 4. The bird grows: As there is no baby bird, there will be no growth or development happening in this step. 5. Begins to learn how to fly: With no baby bird growing and developing, there is no bird to learn flying skills or practice for eventual independence. 6. The bird matures: Without a baby bird growing and learning, there is no bird to reach maturity or enter adulthood, so this step is also void. 7. The bird leaves its nest: Since there is no maturing bird, there will be no instance of a bird leaving its nest as it transitions to independence. 8. The bird makes its own nest: With no adult bird that developed from a baby bird, there is no bird to create its own nest and begin the cycle anew. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis stating that there is no baby bird has a direct and significant effect on the entire process of a bird's life cycle. It essentially halts the entire life cycle, with none of the subsequent steps taking place due to the absence of a baby bird. The process cannot function or progress without its crucial starting point."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Stayton was twirling his gun in the air, and as he attempted to put the weapon in his holster, it slipped from his hand, struck the concrete floor and fired. Renee Chaires was fatally shot while her family was holding a cookout at her older brother Eric Stayton's house. (wctv) “During this gathering there had been an accidental discharge of a firearm which resulted in, ultimately, the death of one of the persons there at the cookout,” said Leon County Sheriff’s Office spokesman James McQuaig. The single bullet struck Chaires in the neck. The shooting is under investigation. Stayton, 50, has not been charged. ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

The party has been in opposition at the federal level since the 2013 election. Bill Shorten has been the party's federal parliamentary leader since 13 October 2013. The party is a federal party with branches in each state and territory. Labor is in government in the states of Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, and in both the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory. The party competes against the Liberal/National Coalition for political office at the federal and state (and sometimes local) levels. Labor's constitution has long stated: \\"The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields\\". This \\"socialist objective\\" was introduced in 1921, but was later qualified by two further objectives: \\"maintenance of and support for a competitive non-monopolistic private sector\\" and \\"the right to own private property\\". Labor governments have not attempted the \\"democratic socialisation\\" of any industry since the 1940s, when the Chifley government failed to nationalise the private banks, and in fact have privatised several industries such as aviation and banking. Labor's current National Platform describes the party as \\"a modern social democratic party\\", \\"the party of opportunity and security for working people\\" and \\"a party of active government\\".

The Drew Carey Show is an American sitcom that aired on ABC from 1995 to 2004, and was set in Cleveland, Ohio, and revolved around the retail office and home life of \\"everyman\\" Drew Carey, a fictionalized version of the actor. The show was created by Carey, who had both stand-up comedy and writing experience, and Bruce Helford, who was once a writer for Roseanne. It was the first television show to have an episode simulcast on the Internet. Produced by Mohawk Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, it debuted on September 13, 1995, and ranked among the Top 30 programs for four seasons before sliding in popularity. Beginning in season 8, the show rotated through 9 different opening sequences, each of which contained a new version of one of the show's three theme songs. Each theme (\\"Moon Over Parma\\", \\"Five O'Clock World\\" and \\"Cleveland Rocks\\") was seen in three different segments, in new, wildly different arrangements. The show eventually went back to having just five main characters, akin to the first season, as Kate, Mr. Wick, and Steve were eventually written out of the show. Kate's character was married off, Mr. Wick disappeared after three appearances until the Season 8 finale, wherein it is revealed he became a weatherman (although he continued to appear in the opening credits, unlike Kate, who was eliminated completely, and never mentioned again.) Steve left at the beginning of the ninth season to \\"find himself\\". With Winfred-Louder closed, the location became the office of online retailer Neverending Store. Drew, Mimi, and Mr. Wick were hired as employees of the new company. Mimi was hired first in a similar role to her old job, and Drew was eventually hired as \\"Internal Expediting Analyst\\", and a recurring gag began wherein Drew had no clue as to what his job entailed. Before being written out, Mr. Wick was at first a janitor, and another recurring joke came in the form of Mr. Wick attempting to climb the ladder back to being the boss. Before being written out, he went from janitor to the carrier of the dessert trolley. Kate left after the first two episodes of season 8, the same two episodes that introduced Kellie, an old high school friend of Drew's who had been working as a stripper. She eventually became a waitress at The Warsaw Tavern, Drew's girlfriend, and the carrier of his child. The plot of the final episode was Drew and Kellie attempting to get married before their child is born. Mr. Wick also returned and stayed on for the series finale. The show began featuring cameos from reality-TV participants in the final two seasons, such as former Road Rules star Timmy Beggy, The Real World alumna Cara Khan, and The Amazing Race winner Reichen Lehmkuhl. Tony the Bus Driver (Bill Cobbs) became a regular, serving as smart-alecky \\"bartender\\" type to whom Drew could tell his problems. The eighth season was put in a timeslot that frequently clashed with Monday Night Football. It was pulled mid-season and the remaining episodes were shown during the summer of 2003. The ninth season did not air until the summer of 2004, with most of the episodes out of order. The last season's tone changed radically from the previous seasons. The directors began experimenting with one-camera set-ups, showing the sets completely built, with four walls in most rooms, and with rooms actually linked together. The writers also began experimenting, including story lines in which Gus burns down Mimi's house, forcing her to move in with Drew after Steve leaves her.

Given the question \\"How would Aubrey feel as a result?\\", is \\"Nothing\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, I will analyze the information provided and evaluate the validity of the given answer. Step 1: Understand the context Aubrey has just heard about Remy's tragic death. We are given the information that Aubrey is shocked. Additionally, Aubrey is sitting and memories of Remy are running through Aubrey's mind. Step 2: Assess Aubrey's emotions Given the context, Aubrey is likely to be experiencing a mix of emotions, such as shock, sadness, grief, or even disbelief. The memories of Remy running through their mind suggest that Aubrey is reminiscing about their experiences with Remy and is most likely emotionally affected by the news. Step 3: Evaluate the validity of the answer \\"Nothing\\" The answer \\"Nothing\\" suggests that Aubrey would not feel any emotions as a result of learning about Remy's death and recalling memories of Remy.

Thames Valley district reporter Jamie Pyatt and picture editor John Edwards were charged with three counts each, while ex-reporter John Troup was accused of two counts. The trial related to illegal payments allegedly made to public officials, with prosecutors saying the men conspired to pay officials from 2002–11, including police, prison officers and soldiers. They were accused of buying confidential information about the Royal Family, public figures and prison inmates. They all denied the charges.

This movie leaves me looking forward to the director's next film; we can say of Rian Johnson, as somebody once said about a dame named Brigid O'Shaughnessy, 'You're good. You're very good.' 2. Brick would be better with a bit more Lynch in its soul, but Johnson is his own man, and I look forward to what he comes up with next. 3. Even as you struggle to keep up with its speedy chatter and multi-character complexity, Brick is always entertaining. 4. There are a million stories in the naked city, and Brick never gets around to telling any of them. 5. Johnson takes the regular travails of high school life - romances, cliques and clashes, teenage pregnancy and drugs - and applies the stylings of Dashiell Hammett for a schoolyard film noir that never plays as gimmicky as it might sound. 6. You can't deny the fellow who made it has talent. 7. Johnson also grabs hold of a fundamental truth and seduces us with it: The schoolyard can be the noirest burg of all. 8. What sounds like a stunt, or a genre-mashup oddity like Bugsy Malone, proves to be a sharp, tongue-in-cheek exercise, balancing deadpan menace with well-timed comedy. 9. The single most satisfying cinematic experience of 'Brick' lies in witnessing director Johnson's matter-of-fact transformation of the contemporary American suburban landscape into a moral stage of mythic proportion. 10. It may be a little predictable, but it gets points for style and for making the effort to be different. What is the consensus?","completion":"The consensus on the movie 'Brick,' directed by Rian Johnson, is overwhelmingly positive. The director is highly commended for his talent and ability to truly engage the audience. The critics look forward to seeing his future works, indicating their respect for this director's skill. The viewers thoroughly enjoyed the narrative of the film despite its complexity. Even though the film does not explore traditional city tales, it stands out by taking the mundane setting of a schoolyard and transforming it into an intricate noir landscape. The film's unique narrative style is consistently referred to as innovative, taking on ordinary high school lives and presenting them through a stylistic lens reminiscent of Dashiell Hammett. The cinematic transformation of the suburban American landscape into a morally significant stage was seen as the most satisfying aspect of the movie. The decision to morph the everyday routine into a noir setting is not only appealing but also recognizes the schoolyard as possibly the darkest city of all, reflecting a profound truth. Despite some critiques, where the movie is said to be slightly predictable, the film seems to excel in its style and its efforts to stand out, thus gaining points for the same. The film also manages to balance its noir threats with well-timed comedy for a more enjoyable watch. This enables the film to somewhat transcend its anticipated gimmickry and provide a more indulgent viewing experience. In conclusion, the film is deemed as sharp, tongue-in-cheek enjoyably complex, and effectively stylish. Rian Johnson's 'Brick' tends to represent high-school life in a noir lens with surprising profundity and humor, marking it as a commendable cinematic experience. It might bear some minor predictability issues, but its stylistic approach and unique narrative structure largely overshadow it, making it a film that truly stands out in the eyes of the critics. As a result, it is looked upon with anticipation for what the director would come up with next."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

When he saw his father and so many of his countrymen suffer,Bwelle decided to do something about it. He became a doctor himself.And he started an organization,ASCOVIME. It travels into the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care. Since 2008,he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people. Almost every Friday,his team jam into vans and travel to villages in need. In each trip they receive 500 people. Patients come on foot from 60 kilometers around the village for free treatment. The next morning,the team will do simple operations in a schoolhouse,town hall or home,and work into the early hours of Sunday morning. On Sunday,the team heads back to the city,tired but proud of their work. They know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help. For his devotion to his country and people,Georges Bwelle becomes one of the 2013 Heroes voted throughout the world. The passage mainly tells us _ .

Q:Information: - Surra (from the Marathi \\"sra\\", meaning the sound of heavy breathing through nostrils, of imitative origin) is a disease of vertebrate animals. The disease is caused by protozoan trypanosomes, specifically \\"Trypanosoma evansi\\", of several species which infect the blood of the vertebrate host, causing fever, weakness, and lethargy which lead to weight loss and anemia. In some animals the disease is fatal unless treated. - Trypanosomiasis or trypanosomosis is the name of several diseases in vertebrates caused by parasitic protozoan trypanosomes of the genus \\"Trypanosoma\\". - Trypanosoma cruzi is a species of parasitic euglenoids. Amongst the protozoa, the trypanosomes characteristically bore tissue in another organism and feed on blood (primarily) and also lymph. This behaviour causes disease or the likelihood of disease that varies with the organism: for example, trypanosomiasis in humans (Chagas disease in South America ), dourine and surra in horses, and a brucellosis-like disease in cattle. Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous insect triatomine (descriptions \\"assassin bug\\", \\"cone-nose bug\\", and \\"kissing bug\\") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host's skin surface and then bites. Penetration of the infected faeces is further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host. - A protease (also called a peptidase or proteinase) is any enzyme that performs proteolysis; protein catabolism by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Proteases have evolved multiple times, and different classes of protease can perform the same reaction by completely different catalytic mechanisms. Proteases can be found in Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Archaea and viruses. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Cysteine (abbreviated as Cys or C) is a semi-essential proteinogenic amino acid with the formula HOCCH(NH)CHSH. It is encoded by the codons UGU and UGC. The thiol side chain in cysteine often participates in enzymatic reactions, as a nucleophile. The thiol is susceptible to oxidization to give the disulfide derivative cystine, which serves an important structural role in many proteins. When used as a food additive, it has the E number E920. - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan \\"Trypanosoma cruzi\\". It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 812 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 6070% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people. \\"T. cruzi\\" is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking \\"kissing bugs\\" of the subfamily Triatominae. These insects are known by a number of local names, including: \\"vinchuca\\" in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, \\"barbeiro\\" (the barber) in Brazil, \\"pito\\" in Colombia, \\"chinche\\" in Central America, and \\"chipo\\" in Venezuela. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by vertical transmission (from a mother to her fetus). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for \\"T. cruzi\\" in the blood. Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine has not been developed as of 2013. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of endstage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox... - A catalytic triad refers to the three amino acid residues that function together at the centre of the active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and -lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold. - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. - Cysteine proteases, also known as thiol proteases, are enzymes that degrade proteins. These proteases share a common catalytic mechanism that involves a nucleophilic cysteine thiol in a catalytic triad or dyad. - Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. The study of enzymes is called \\"enzymology\\". - Cruzipain is a cysteine protease expressed by Trypanosoma cruzi . It is classified under EC 3.4.22.51 . - In organic chemistry, a thiol is an organosulfur compound that contains a carbon-bonded sulfhydryl or sulphydryl (CSH or RSH) group (where R represents an alkyl or other organic substituent). Thiols are the sulfur analogue of alcohols (that is, sulfur takes the place of oxygen in the hydroxyl group of an alcohol), and the word is a portmanteau of \\"thion\\" + \\"alcohol,\\" with the first word deriving from Greek (\\"theion\\") = \\"sulfur\\".

Process: - Air is pulled into the lungs - Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks - Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose my nose is clear happens, how will it affect I cannot breath well. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided is: \\"suppose my nose is clear happens, how will it affect I cannot breathe well.\\" This hypothesis suggests that if your nose is clear, it may affect your breathing. It's important to first clarify the normal process of breathing and talking: 1. Air is pulled into the lungs through the nose or mouth. This happens involuntarily in a process called inhalation. 2. Oxygen from the inhaled air moves from the lungs into the bloodstream through tiny blood vessels called capillaries. This is facilitated by the large surface area of the alveoli, small sacs within the lungs. 3. When a person talks, air is pushed from the lungs through the vocal cords (within the larynx) to create sounds. This requires voluntary control over the muscles involved in exhaling and in the production of speech. 4. Exhaled air, which contains carbon dioxide and other waste gases, is pushed out of the lungs and into the environment through the nose or mouth. Now, let's examine how the perturbation of a clear nose may affect breathing. If your nose is clear, it implies that there is no blockage or congestion in the nasal passages. As a result, air can flow more freely through the nose during both inhalation and exhalation. This is generally beneficial for the breathing process, as it allows for more efficient gas exchange and can help prevent excessive strain on the respiratory system. However, the hypothesis statement also mentions that \\"I cannot breathe well,\\" suggesting that there might still be an issue with breathing despite the clear nose. In this case, the problem may not be directly related to the nose, but to other factors affecting the respiratory system. Possibilities might include lung conditions (such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), anxiety or stress, or even improper breathing techniques. To summarize, a clear nose typically has a positive effect on the breathing process, as it facilitates the efficient intake of oxygen and removal of waste gases. However, if you still have difficulty breathing with a clear nose, the root cause may be unrelated to nasal congestion and could involve other factors affecting the respiratory system."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

It's impossible to say. While the information provided in the paragraph showcases the enduring legacy of Marvel Comics and highlights a significant character from the Golden Age of Comic Books, it does not give us enough information to conclusively determine if Marvel Comics are always classic reads. The Angel, as one of the many characters featured in Marvel Comics, was indeed created during an iconic period, but the overall quality and timelessness of Marvel Comics cannot be solely determined through the information provided in the paragraph. Marvel Comics has an extensive history with numerous characters and storylines, and opinions on what constitutes a \\"classic read\\" can vary greatly among readers. Some may argue that Marvel's classic characters and stories are indeed timeless, while others might suggest that there are specific periods or storylines that are more engaging and memorable. The enduring popularity and continued success of Marvel Comics do point to a potential consensus among many fans that the comics hold a certain level of timelessness and classic appeal. However, without more comprehensive information on the various eras, storylines, and creative teams involved in Marvel Comics over the years, we cannot definitively say whether all Marvel Comics are always classic reads. To make such a conclusion, we would need to take a broader look at Marvel's vast catalog and consider differing opinions on what defines a \\"classic read\\" in the world of comic books."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hotshot businessman Bill Campbell has returned to his hometown of Buzzsaw at the request of his younger sister Marci, who is convinced that their stepfather Mayor Van Der Haven has been murdered and replaced by his twin brother Matt Skearns. On the way to Buzzsaw, Bill's car and clothes (including his wallet which contains an important contact number) are stolen by a woman named Sally and he is forced to hitchhike home naked, where he is picked up by two drunken brothers—both named Jim (Monks and Reilly). Over the course of the day, Campbell must find Sally, retrieve his wallet, and avoid the diabolical Skearns, who is looking for financial compensation after spending 15 years in prison for a crime committed by his twin brother. The film ends with Skearns driving off a cliff and into a canyon, rather than risk capture by the police.

It differs from documentary television in that the focus tends to be on drama, personal conflict, and entertainment rather than educating viewers. The genre has various standard tropes, including \\"confessionals\\" (also called \\"talking heads\\" or \\"interview segments\\") used by cast members to express their thoughts, which often double as the shows' narration.

The Perth Metropolitan Region includes 30 local government areas, which themselves consist of a large number of suburbs, extending from Two Rocks in the north to Rockingham in the south, and east inland to The Lakes. - Neighbours is an Australian television soap opera. It was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It was created by TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's \\"Sons and Daughters\\", which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, \\"Neighbours\\" underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening \\"Neighbours\\" on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. \\"Neighbours\\" has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame.

Would \\"The story was an imaginary tale which told the final story of the Silver Age Superman and his long history, which was being rebooted following the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths , before his modern introduction in the John Byrne series, The Man of Steel .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"While the statement provided captures a part of Superman's comic book history, there are various important events and story arcs that have occurred to Superman over the decades. Here is a more detailed answer: Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1 in 1938, created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The character quickly became an icon and an essential part of DC Comics' line-up, spawning a plethora of stories and iterations leading to his current version. The statement you provided mentions the Silver Age Superman, a version that existed mainly from the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s. During this time, Superman underwent numerous adventures with a campier and more science-fiction-focused tone. \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" (1985-1986) was a DC Comics crossover event that aimed to make the DC universe more cohesive and less convoluted by eliminating multiple parallel worlds and alternate versions of characters. As a result, elements of Superman's Silver Age history were rewritten or erased. The story you mentioned, \\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\\" by Alan Moore, was indeed an \\"imaginary tale\\" or an \\"Elseworlds\\" story, which served as a tribute to Silver Age Superman's long history. It was published in 1986 as a two-part send-off for this version of the character before a major reboot that would redefine Superman for a new era. The reboot involved writer and artist John Byrne, who was tasked with reimagining the character following the reboot. His series, titled \\"The Man of Steel\\" (1986), modernized Superman's origin, powers, and mythos for contemporary audiences. In this new version, Superman's powers were somewhat reduced compared to the Silver Age, making him less god-like and more relatable to readers. The series also offered an updated take on his relationships with supporting characters like Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Ma and Pa Kent, and others. Since then, Superman has undergone several other significant changes and events in the comics, such as: 1. \\"The Death of Superman\\" (1992): Superman died fighting the monster Doomsday in a highly publicized storyline that captured mainstream media attention. He would later be resurrected, of course. 2. \\"Superman: Red Son\\" (2003): An Elseworlds tale that imagines Superman's origin in the Soviet Union rather than the USA. 3. \\"Infinite Crisis\\" (2005-2006): Another major crossover event that once again redefined the DC universe and revised some aspects of Superman's history. 4. The New 52 (2011): DC Comics rebooted its entire line, including Superman's, with a modern and more streamlined continuity. 5. DC Rebirth (2016): A relaunch of the DC comic book line which sought to restore classic elements of the characters, including Superman's, bringing about a more hopeful and inspiring version of the hero. In summary, various changes and events have happened to Superman in comics throughout the years. While the statement you provided is accurate for a specific moment in Superman's history, it does not encompass the entire scope of his evolution. The character has undergone multiple reboots, reimaginings, and significant storylines that have transformed his narrative over time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Smartphone usage has skyrocketed at sporting events, as anyone who's attended a recent game can tell you. Look around the stands and you'll see fans checking stats, sharing pictures on social media, or just killing time between plays. While stadiums have boosted cellular and Wi-Fi infrastructure to keep fans connected during games, there's always the possibility that there won't be enough bandwidth for everyone. That's why on Super Bowl Sunday, the NFL is planning to block live streams of the game inside the stadium. Super Bowl XLVIII, between the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks, will be streamed by NFL.com and Fox Sports, but both of those sources will be blocked on the Wi-Fi and cellular networks at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, NFL CIO Michelle McKenna-Doyle told Ars in a phone interview. The NFL.com and Fox Sports blocks will be implemented both for mobile apps and within Web browsers. The decision stems from last year's Super Bowl, when streaming was initially allowed but eventually blocked when it took up too much bandwidth. \\"We [blocked] it last year, but we did it on the fly when we started having some challenges. This year we planned ahead to do it,\\" McKenna-Doyle said. She said the 82,500-seat stadium will be able to handle 25,000 to 30,000 concurrent Internet users across cellular and Wi-Fi. The NFL didn't tell us what the anticipated speeds are because Verizon, which led the Wi-Fi and cellular buildout, preferred to keep that information under wraps. But the plan is to prioritize upload speeds over download because fans generally spend a lot of time posting photos and statuses to social media. The NFL is providing a Super Bowl app to attendees with an event guide and \\"exclusive content,\\" but it won't include streaming video or replays. \\"While we do know that people like to look at replays on their phones and there are some people who like to stream certain amounts of video in the game, the vast majority of our fans want to watch the game on the field, watch the replays on the jumbo board, and participate in the event more than they want to be checking their phone,\\" McKenna-Doyle said. \\"While we could have made some of that available, it might have impacted the ability for the majority of the fans to be able to stay connected to social media, tweet, Facebook, that kind of thing.\\" Big games, big network usage. At last year's Super Bowl, the Wi-Fi network stayed up even during the infamous mid-game power outage. While some attendees told Ars after last year's game that Wi-Fi access was problematic at times, a broadcast engineer we spoke with measured the network at 23Mbps down and 44Mbps up. It's common at high-density events for fans to have trouble sending text messages or uploading photos, McKenna-Doyle noted. Network congestion is especially pronounced at key moments of each game. While attending the final game of last year's World Series at Fenway Park in Boston, I was able to upload, e-mail, and text photos on the cellular network during the game. Immediately after the final out however, fans swarmed the network and uploads became impossible. \\"When you can't do the basics, it's all of a sudden not that cool that you can show replays or stream the game,\\" McKenna-Doyle said. \\"It's a fine balance. We're pushing the envelope every year. As technology gets better and better I'm willing to take more and more risks about what we allow.\\" McKenna-Doyle is optimistic that multicast technology, as opposed to the unicast tech used today, will limit the amount of data needed for streaming video at future Super Bowls. \\"A Unicast transmission/stream sends IP packets to a single recipient on a network. A Multicast transmission sends IP packets to a group of hosts on a network,\\" explains network video Visionary Solutions. But that won't be used at this year's game, because multicast streaming isn't commonly supported on smartphones yet, McKenna-Doyle said. Keeping fans connected. The Super Bowl restriction doesn't mean live streaming is blocked at every NFL game. For example, the New England Patriots' app provides access to NFL Red Zone video when users are connected to Gillette Stadium's Wi-Fi network. \\"It depends on the stadium,\\" McKenna-Doyle said. \\"Each team manages every game themselves and they have mobile apps that they run. Some allow it based on their infrastructure, and some block it.\\" The Wi-Fi network, open to all fans, has about 900 access points, using Cisco equipment powered by the new 802.11ac standard, according to the NFL. Verizon is providing the Internet connectivity, with about 4Gbps coming into the stadium. While Verizon is the lead vendor, all four major carriers invested in upgrading their Distributed Antenna Systems at the Super Bowl site, McKenna-Doyle said. One nicety provided to attendees is a radio providing four audio feeds from Fox, Westwood One, ESPN Deportes, and the in-stadium public address. While it would be possible to provide audio feeds to a mobile app, McKenna-Doyle noted that \\"We've always given this radio for broadcast, and fans have told us they really love it.\\" As usual, the Super Bowl crew will use monitoring tools to identify hacker attacks on the network or technical problems that prevent fans from getting on the Internet. Monitoring user activity helps plan capacity for future events and fix problems as they arise. Network monitoring tools divide the stadium into sectors, and this year \\"we cut the stadium into more sectors than we had in the past so we can pinpoint more quickly where issues are in a section of the stadium,\\" McKenna-Doyle said. \\"If we start to hear we're having issues in a certain part, we can work on a smaller segment of the stadium without it impacting as many people.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. The NFL plans to block live streams of the Super Bowl inside the stadium to prevent bandwidth issues for fans attending the game. 2. NFL.com and Fox Sports, the official streaming sources, will be blocked on Wi-Fi and cellular networks at the stadium. 3. The decision is based on last year's Super Bowl, where streaming was initially allowed but eventually blocked due to bandwidth concerns. 4. The 82,500-seat stadium is expected to handle 25,000 to 30,000 concurrent internet users across cellular and Wi-Fi. 5. Upload speeds will be prioritized over download speeds to accommodate for fans posting photos and updates on social media. 6. A Super Bowl app for attendees will be available but will not include streaming video or replays. 7.

In a stark contrast to the come-from-behind victory against Denver earlier in the season, San Diego scored early and often in this game, leading the game 28-3 at halftime. It was all Denver in the 3rd quarter, the Broncos closing the gap to 28-20, but San Diego bounced back in the fourth quarter with 20 unanswered points, winning the game 48-20. The win, as well as a Kansas City Chiefs loss earlier in the day, clinched the AFC West Division for San Diego. With the Indianapolis Colts also losing earlier in the day, San Diego gained the best record in the AFC (11-2). In addition, with his 7-yard rushing touchdown toward the end of the 4th quarter (his third of the game), RB LaDainian Tomlinson broke the NFL single-season touchdown record (29) (26 Rushing, 3 receiving), set by the Seattle Seahawks' RB Shaun Alexander (28) in the previous season.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of the lava continuously flowing and not cooling would indirectly impact a step of the process. To understand this, let's first briefly revisit the main steps involved in the formation of a volcano and its eruptions: 1. Magma rises from deep within the Earth due to convection currents, tectonic plate movements, or hotspots. 2. This magma accumulates in magma chambers beneath volcanic structures. 3. Over time, pressure builds up in the magma chambers as more magma accumulates, and dissolved gases become trapped. 4. The increasing pressure forces magma through fissures or vents, leading to a volcanic eruption. 5. As lava flows out of the volcano, it cools and solidifies, forming new layers of rock. 6. After the eruption, the cycle repeats as more magma rises and accumulates beneath the surface, eventually leading to another eruption. In the hypothetical scenario where lava keeps flowing and does not cool, this would indirectly impact steps 5 and 6 of the process, as the lava would not solidify and create the new layer of rock. The continuous flow of lava means there is less pressure build-up in the magma chamber, making it less likely for the volcano to erupt through the newly formed rock layers. However, it is important to note that this perturbation may not completely stop the formation of new rock layers or prevent future eruptions. Over time, the lava flow rate may decrease, allowing some parts of the lava flow to cool and create rock formations. Additionally, other factors such as increasing magma supply or tectonic forces could eventually cause the volcanic eruption to break through the uncooled lava flow. In summary, the perturbation of lava continuously flowing and not cooling affects the process indirectly by altering the conditions that lead to the formation of new rock layers after an eruption. This can change how pressure builds up within the magma chamber, potentially impacting the timing and intensity of future eruptions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Barnes & Noble bets on the Nook If you’re the type of early Christmas shopper who bought a Kindle last week, I hope you kept the receipt, because a newer, equally affordable option is about to hit shelves. Barnes & Noble BKS CEO Steve Riggio on Tuesday took the stage before hundreds of authors, agents, publishers and pundits to debut the company’s electronic reader, the Nook. The Nook will sell for just 259, a steep discount from competitors like the Sony SNE Reader and the iRex DR800SG , which both retail for 399. The price suggests Barnes & Noble is going straight for Amazon AMZN , which recently lowered the Kindle’s price to 259. The Nook uses the same screen technology that powers Amazon’s Kindle, but adds an iPhone-like color touchscreen below for easy navigation. Readers have access to 3G wireless on AT&T’s broadband network. The reader holds up to 1,500 books (like its major competitor), but an expandable memory slot allows readers to add up to 17,500 more. “You’re getting a lot of eReader for the money,” says Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst with Forrester Research. Another novel experiment: lending. Barnes & Noble lets readers share titles with friends on any platform in the Barnes & Noble ecosystem. So you like the “Tipping Point?” Buy it for your Nook and lend it to your sister to read on her Barnes & Noble iPhone application. (She’d better not procrastinate; she has 14 days before it disappears.) Barnes & Noble will turn its massive retail presence into a competitive advantage. Over the next few weeks, the bookstore chain will roll out Nook displays in its 700 stores and 600 college bookstores. Through complimentary Wi-Fi connections in all the stores, readers will be able to browse eBooks on their readers just as they might have always browsed the shelves. The eBook market is tiny, but its growth has been explosive this year. eBook accounts for less than 2% of traditional book sales, but the 16.2 million in sales for July, for example, represented a 213% increase over a year ago, according to Forrester Research. Right now Amazon has 60% of the market, but the eReader is expected to be a popular Christmas item this year, and Barnes & Noble plans to get in on that opportunity. Pre-orders for the Nook will begin this week, and the company says it will begin shipping in late November. The large bookstore has been lunging into the eBook market at full force. It purchased independent eBook seller Fictionwise earlier this year and launched its own eBook store in July. It has also unleashed a series of smartphone applications, with more planned. While there’s no guarantee Barnes & Noble will succeed, it’s a necessary move as the book market becomes increasing tough to navigate. Traditional books — the kind you bring to the beach and lug on the subway — are getting much cheaper. In the last week, Amazon, Wal-Mart WMT , and Target TGT have begun selling some of this year’s hardbacks that are anticipated to be the most popular — books like Stephen King’s “Under the Dome ” (35.00) and Sarah Palin’s “Going Rogue” (list price: 28.99) — for roughly 9 on pre-orders. Sure, it’s typical to discount bestsellers, especially during the holidays, but few retailers are bold enough to bring down the prices by more than 50%. Barnes & Noble must now hope the Nook masters its niche. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about Barnes & Noble, an American bookseller, launching its electronic reader called Nook in an attempt to compete with Amazon's Kindle.

A group of people called Pew Research asked many people what they think about this. They found out that 67 out of 100 people believe there is a big or very big problem because of the differences between rich and poor people. This is a lot more than what people thought two years ago. This means that more people in America think that this problem is even bigger than problems about people coming from other countries, or problems between people of different colors, or problems between older people and younger people. The person who did this study said, \\"It's kind of amazing\\". He also said that more people think this problem is getting even bigger and stronger. This is important because it can affect decisions made by people who run the country. But, not all people believe that rich people are bad or didn't work hard. 43 out of 100 people think that rich people have lots of money because they worked very hard. 46 out of 100 people think they have lots of money because they know the right people or were born into families that already have lots of money.

Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 - June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the \\"King of Pop\\", he was one of the most popular entertainers in the world, and was the best-selling music artist during the year of his death. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson was influenced by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: \\"Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I had never seen a performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown.\\" Jackson owed his vocal technique in large part to Diana Ross, especially his use of the oooh interjection, which he used from a young age; Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with the Supremes. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: \\"I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang - just the way she was.\\" He told her: \\"I want to be just like you, Diana.\\" She said: \\"You just be yourself.\\" According to choreographer David Winters, who met and befriended Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, Jackson watched the musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in \\"Beat It\\" and the \\"Bad\\" video.

On the Jets' next possession, Pennington fired a 44-yard touchdown pass to Justin McCareins, his first touchdown of the season, to open up a 14-0 lead. The Lions would get on the board early in the second quarter as Jon Kitna had big completions to Dan Campbell, Mike Furrey, and Roy Williams, the pass to Williams a 22-yard touchdown. But on the kickoff, Justin Miller returned the ball 56 yards inside Detroit territory, and after a pass from Pennington to Cotchery, Kevan Barlow scored on a 3-yard touchdown run. Kitna would get intercepted by Kerry Rhodes on the next possession, but Pennington would then get picked off by Terrence Holt at the Detroit 2-yard line to short-circuit a possible score. The Jets led 21-7 at halftime. Kitna would again get intercepted on the first possession of the second half, this time by Jonathan Vilma.

Select from: -- description -- entity -- abbreviation -- human -- numeric -- location","completion":"In the early Popeye cartoons, an interesting method was used to run the credits. The production company, Fleischer Studios, employed a technique called the \\"Tabletop Credits.\\" This method made the credits stand out and provided a unique way of presenting the information. This answer will give an in-depth description of the Tabletop Credits method. The Tabletop Credits method was essentially a stop-motion animation technique used in the opening credits of early Popeye cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios in the 1930s. Fleischer Studios was an American animation studio, founded by brothers Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer, and was mainly responsible for producing Popeye the Sailor content during this period. To understand the Tabletop Credits technique, it is important to first familiarize oneself with stop-motion animation. Stop-motion animation is a technique in which physical objects, such as figurines, miniatures, or models, are manipulated in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a continuous sequence. In other words, instead of drawing the animation by hand or using computer-generated imagery, stop-motion brings static objects to life through a series of photographs that are then sequenced together. In the context of early Popeye cartoons, the Tabletop Credits method involved the use of physical letters and objects related to the theme of the cartoon. These objects were placed on a flat surface, usually a table, and arranged in such a way that they formed the names and roles of the production staff, such as the animators, producers, voice actors, and so on. Each credit would appear on screen for a few seconds before transitioning to the next one. To create this effect, photographers would snap a photo of the tabletop setup with the letters and objects in place. The objects and letters would then be rearranged for the subsequent credit, and another photograph would be taken. This process would be repeated for each of the required credits, creating multiple photographs that, when played in sequence, would form a coherent credit sequence. The Tabletop Credits method was notable for its creativity and level of detail. For example, a Popeye cartoon with a nautical theme might have the opening credits arranged with objects such as ropes, anchors, and buoys to enhance the nautical imagery in the viewer's mind. This style of presenting the credits made early Popeye cartoons stand out from other animations of that time. In conclusion, the Tabletop Credits technique used in early Popeye cartoons was an innovative approach to displaying information in the opening credits. By using stop-motion animation to create a dynamic and visually appealing sequence of images, Fleischer Studios was able to distinguish its cartoons from those produced by other animation studios during that era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: This is what happens when you make the Internet mad. On Wednesday, a group of technology companies began an unusual form of protest: The firms shut down or replaced the content on their own popular Web sites with protest messages to show their unhappiness with two Internet-regulation bills grinding through Congress. They argue that the bills would impose huge regulatory costs and stifle innovation on the Web. Around the country, Americans woke up without some of the oddball essentials of online life. No Wikipedia. No Reddit, a compendium of links to stories and funny pictures that draws millions a day. And no I Can Has Cheezburger?, the world’s best-known collection of funny cat pictures. Related: How to get around the blackout In Washington, however, Wednesday has another significance. It culminates a surprising lobbying effort in which technology companies such as Twitter, Wikipedia and Google have used their massive reach into Americans’ daily lives as a political weapon, to whip up support from online users. In this fight, they were pitted against traditional Washington heavyweights, such as Hollywood and the recording industry. And even before the LOLcats went on strike, it seemed as though the tech companies were winning. This fight is over two similar bills: the House’s Stop Online Piracy Act and the Senate’s Protect IP (intellectual property) Act. Both are meant to attack the problem of foreign Web sites that sell pirated or counterfeit goods. They would impose restrictions forcing U.S. companies to stop selling online ads to suspected pirates, processing payments for illegal online sales and refusing to list Web sites suspected of piracy in search-engine results. The idea is to cut off the channels that deliver American customers, and their money, to potential pirates. But tech companies see the laws as a dangerous overreach, objecting because, they say, the laws would add burdensome costs and new rules that would destroy the freewheeling soul of the Internet. “The voice of the Internet community has been heard,” Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who sided with the tech companies, said in a statement. Issa said he had already been told of a victory: GOP leaders told him that the House would not vote on a version of the bill that those companies oppose. “Much more education for Members of Congress about the workings of the Internet is essential.” The biggest impact of Wednesday’s blackout may be in the shutdown of the English-language version of Wikipedia, which gets 2.7 billion U.S. visitors per month. “It is the opinion of the English Wikipedia community that both of these bills, if passed, would be devastating to the free and open web,” said a statement signed by three of the free encyclopedia’s administrators, with the handles “NuclearWarfare,” “Risker” and “Billinghurst.” They said the decision to shut down the English-language portion of the site, starting at midnight Eastern time, had been made after a virtual discussion that involved 1,800 users. But already, the momentum of the two controversial bills has been largely halted. Just weeks ago, they seemed on their way to passage, having cleared a Senate committee and garnered bipartisan support in the House. Now, there is a bipartisan retreat. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), who co-sponsored an earlier version of the bill, has announced his opposition. Six Republicans on the same Senate committee — all of whom voted for the bill before — have written Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) to ask that he slow the bill down, so it can be modified and considered later. “We have increasingly heard from a large number of constituents and stakeholders with vocal concerns about possible unintended consequences of the proposed legislation,” the six wrote. They included Sen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the back offices of the Senate, many longtime aides were amazed at how quickly a new lobbying force had managed to outmaneuver experienced heavyweights. Sites such as Wikipedia and Tumblr had encouraged users to contact legislators, resulting in a flood of unhappy calls. One Republican aide said that “SOPA” had already become “a dirty word beyond anything you can imagine.” Both of the bills would allow the Justice Department to seek an injunction in court, barring U.S. sites from processing payments for a rogue Web site, selling it ads or listing its link among search-engine results. “There’s no fundamental First Amendment right to engage in thievery. Nor to advertise thievery,” said Howard Gantman, at the Motion Picture Association of America. He said that the Internet’s free-for-all nature should not allow U.S. companies impunity to deal with crooks. “Do we want to have laws?” Gantman said. “Or do we want to just say it’s a free-for-all Wild West?” In addition to the costs, however, the tech companies say they would have to police vast sites full of user-generated content. They also objected to a provision that would have stripped the rogue sites out of the Internet’s virtual phone book. If a U.S. user entered the Web address, it would appear the site didn’t exist. That provision “says that we’re no longer committed to the idea that there’s one Web. We’re no longer committed to the idea that any one person, anywhere in the world, can reach any one site anywhere else in the world,” said Sherwin Siy, of the nonprofit advocacy group Public Knowledge. Over the weekend, the tech companies won a major victory. White House officials signaled concerns about the phone-book provision. The bill’s sponsors had already said they would remove it. But several companies say they still have significant problems with the bill. They say the bill spreads culpability too widely and could leave Web sites facing expensive legal fights for a single link to a site deemed to be “rogue.” Instead, many companies have proposed an approach in which the Web sites could police themselves, overseen by an international nonprofit that tracks bad actors. “This is an industry where you can start with a laptop and a good idea and make a billion-dollar company,” said Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit.com. Ohanian said that if the new bill adds potential legal liabilities, the result could be less innovation on the Web. Staff writers Paul Kane, Cecilia Kang, David Nakamura and Hayley Tsukayama contributed to this report. ||||| Thank you – and the more than 7 million other Americans – who stood up for the Web Wednesday, January 18th was a big day for the Web.

Let's solve it together. In the problem, you want to find the value of 'k'. So, you need to do a few steps. First, you want to get 'k' on one side of the equation. We can start by moving '196' from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do that, we subtract '196' from both sides of the equation. 619 - 196 = -47*k This gives us 423 = -47*k. Next, we want to get 'k' all by itself. So, we need to divide each side of the equation by '-47'. 423 divided by -47 equals to 'k'. If you do the division, you will find out that k equals to -9. So, -9 is the solution! I hope this helps you understand it a bit better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Leaving the wood natural in the kitchen maintained its rustic beauty and accentuated the rich grains and intricate patterns of the timber. This decision also provided a warm, welcoming ambiance that perfectly complements the space where our family and friends frequently gather to share meals, laughter, and meaningful conversations. In the kitchen, the natural wood effortlessly blends with the earth-toned color palette, which includes muted shades of browns and greens, combined with the timeless charm of the exposed brickwork and cozy, farmhouse-style décor. This harmonious fusion instills a sense of calmness and belonging, while also showcasing a unique character that is in tune with the architectural elements of our home. We also utilized a quality wood sealer to protect the natural wood against staining, spills, and everyday wear and tear, thus preserving the inherent beauty of the material over time. On the other hand, opting to paint over the wood in the bathroom provided a more practical and visually cohesive solution, given the high levels of moisture and humidity commonly found in that space. To ensure longevity and durability, we selected a high-quality, moisture-resistant paint that would properly protect the wooden surfaces from water damage and mold growth. This choice not only creates a brighter, airier atmosphere but also highlights the intricate details of the cabinetry, molding, and other woodwork within the bathroom. Painting the wood in the bathroom, while leaving it natural in the kitchen, also allowed us to play with different design styles and color schemes in each space. This helped us to create distinctive, yet complementary atmospheres that serve different functional and aesthetic purposes.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.

Once your guinea pig appears comfortable and curious around your hand, you can gently try to pet it or scoop it up using both hands, supporting its body and hind legs to ensure its safety and comfort. When your guinea pig becomes more familiar and comfortable being handled by you, it is essential to give it playtime outside of the cage to encourage both physical and mental stimulation. Remember to always supervise your guinea pig during these sessions and ensure the play area is safe and secure. Forming a bond with your guinea pig may take some time, but with patience, consistency, and care, you'll be able to provide a loving and nurturing environment for your pet. Regular interaction with your guinea pig can help keep it healthy, happy, and well-socialized, leading to a more fulfilling life as a pet owner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Two neighboring towns from Texas produced their food in different ways. Silver town was sustainable and didn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, while Gold town did. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which town caused more fertilizer runoff? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, the town that caused more fertilizer runoff is Gold town. The reason for this is that Gold town used fertilizers and pesticides in their agricultural production, whereas Silver town practiced sustainable methods and did not use any fertilizers or pesticides. When it rains, the fertilizers in Gold town's soil are dissolved, and the runoff carries these chemicals away. The runoff, which contains high levels of nitrogen from the fertilizers, eventually ends up in bodies of water such as ponds and oceans. The excess nitrogen in the water leads to an overgrowth of algae, which in turn depletes the carbon dioxide within the water. Once the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the available oxygen in the water. This process creates a dead zone, an area in a body of water where there is too little oxygen for any life to thrive, such as the large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico mentioned in the paragraph. In contrast, Silver town's sustainable agricultural practices do not contribute to fertilizer runoff, because they do not use any synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Hence, it does not impact the water bodies negatively in the same manner as Gold town. Therefore, given the context, it is clear that Gold town caused more fertilizer runoff than Silver town, due to their conventional agricultural practices involving the use of fertilizers and pesticides, which subsequently leads to the formation of dead zones in bodies of water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Nadia Elena Comaneci was born on November 12, 1961, in Onesti, which is a small town in the Carpathian Mountains, in Bacau County, Romania, in the historical region of Western Moldavia. Comaneci was born to Gheorghe and Stefania Comaneci, and has a younger brother. Her parents separated in the 1970s, and her father (1936-2012) later moved to Bucharest. She and her younger brother Adrian were raised in the faith of the Romanian Orthodox Church. \\"At Montreal [Comaneci] received four of her seven 10s on the uneven bars. The apparatus demands such a spectacular burst of energy in such a short time--only 23 seconds--that it attracts the most fanfare. But it is on the beam that her work seems more representative of her unbelievable skill. She scored three of her seven 10s on the beam. Her hands speak there as much as her body. Her pace magnifies her balance. Her command and distance hush the crowd. On July 18, Comaneci made history at the 1976 Summer Olympics, when during the team compulsory portion of the competition, she was awarded the first perfect 10 in Olympic gymnastics for her routine on the uneven bars. However, Omega SA--the traditional Olympics scoreboard manufacturer-- was led to believe that it was impossible to receive a perfect ten, thus the scoreboard was not programmed to display that score. Comaneci's perfect 10 thus appeared as \\"1.00,\\" the only means by which the judges could indicate that she had indeed received a 10. The crowd was at first confused, but soon understood and gave her a rousing ovation. During the remainder of the Montreal Games, Comaneci earned six additional tens. She won gold medals for the individual all-around, the balance beam and uneven bars. She also won a bronze for the floor exercise and a silver as part of the team all-around. Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim was her main rival during the Montreal Olympics; Kim became the second gymnast to receive a perfect ten for her performance on the vault. Comaneci also took over the spotlight from Olga Korbut, who had been the darling of the 1972 Munich Games. Comaneci's achievements are pictured in the entrance area of Madison Square Garden in New York City, where she is shown presenting her perfect beam exercise. Comaneci was the first Romanian gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title. She also holds the record for being the youngest Olympic gymnastics all-around champion ever. The sport has now revised its age-eligibility requirements. Gymnasts must now turn 16 in the same calendar year of the Olympics to compete during the Games. When Comaneci competed in 1976, gymnasts had to be 14 by the first day of the competition. Legally breaking this record is not currently possible. She was the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year for 1976 and the Associated Press's 1976 \\"Female Athlete of the Year\\". Back home in Romania, Comaneci's success led her to be awarded the Sickle and Hammer Gold Medal, and named a Hero of Socialist Labor; she was the youngest Romanian to receive such recognition during the administration of Nicolae Ceausescu.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What are some more achievements","completion":"As the information provided does not include a specific article to reference, I will use the information provided to list some additional achievements of Nadia Comaneci: 1.

Information: - The Seleucid Empire (\\"Basileía tn Seleukidn\\") was a Hellenistic state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty, which existed from 312 BC to 63 BC; it was founded by Seleucus I Nicator following the division of the Macedonian empire vastly expanded by Alexander the Great. Seleucus received Babylonia and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what is now Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan. - Kuwait ('), officially the State of Kuwait ('), is a country in Western Asia. Situated in the northern edge of Eastern Arabia at the tip of the Persian Gulf, it shares borders with Iraq and Saudi Arabia. , Kuwait has a population of 4.2 million people; 1.3 million are Kuwaitis and 2.9 million are expatriates. Expatriates account for 70% of the population. - Antiochus I Soter ( Greek : ; epithet means \`\` the Saviour '' ; c. 324/3 -- 261 BC ) , was a king of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire . He reigned in 281 -- 261 BC. Antiochus I was half Persian , his mother Apama being one of the eastern princesses whom Alexander the Great had given as wives to his generals in 324 BC. In 294 BC , prior to the death of his father Seleucus I , Antiochus married his stepmother , Stratonice , daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes . His elderly father reportedly instigated the marriage after discovering that his son was in danger of dying of lovesickness . Stratonice bore five children to Antiochus : Seleucus ( he was executed for rebellion ) , Laodice , Apama II , Stratonice of Macedon and Antiochus II Theos , who succeeded his father as king . On the assassination of his father in 281 BC , the task of holding together the empire was a formidable one . A revolt in Syria broke out almost immediately . Antiochus was soon compelled to make peace with his father 's murderer , Ptolemy Keraunos , apparently abandoning Macedonia and Thrace . In Anatolia he was unable to reduce Bithynia or the Persian dynasties that ruled in Cappadocia . In 278 BC the Gauls broke into Anatolia , and a victory that Antiochus won over these Gauls by using Indian war elephants ( 275 BC ) is said to have been the origin of his title of Soter ( Gr. for \`\` saviour '' ) . At the end of 275 BC the question of Coele - Syria , which had been open between the houses of Seleucus and Ptolemy since the partition of 301 BC , led to hostilities ( the First Syrian War ) . It had been continuously in Ptolemaic occupation , but the house of Seleucus maintained its claim . War did not materially change the outlines of the two kingdoms , though frontier cities like Damascus and the coast districts of Asia Minor might change hands . On March 27 268 BC Antiochus I laid the foundation for the Ezida Temple in Borsippa .

It can be described as a glorified nickname. It has various shades of meaning when applied to seemingly real or fictitious people, divinities, objects, and binomial nomenclature. It can also be a descriptive title: for example, Alfred the Great, Suleiman the Magnificent or Wadysaw I the Elbow-high. - Babylonia was an ancient Akkadian-speaking state and cultural area based in central-southern Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). A small Amorite-ruled state emerged in 1894 BC, which contained at this time the minor city of Babylon. Babylon greatly expanded during the reign of Hammurabi in the first half of the 18th century BC, becoming a major capital city. During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards, Babylonia was called \\"Mt Akkad\\" \\"the country of Akkad\\" in the Akkadian language. It was often involved in rivalry with its older fellow Akkadian-speaking state of Assyria in northern Mesopotamia. Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after Hammurabi (fl. c. 1792 1752 BC middle chronology, or c. 1696 1654 BC, short chronology) created a short-lived empire, succeeding the earlier Akkadian Empire, Third Dynasty of Ur, and Old Assyrian Empire; however, the Babylonian empire rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi. - Seleucus I Nicator was one of the Diadochi. Having previously served as an infantry general under Alexander the Great, he eventually assumed the title of basileus and established the Seleucid Empire over much of the territory in the Near East which Alexander had conquered. - Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (\\"Aléxandros ho Mégas\\" ), was a king (\\"basileus\\") of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages.

(Associated Press) In this photo taken Tuesday, Dec. 13, 2016, an Uber driverless car waits in traffic during a test drive in San Francisco. The ride-hailing company is refusing to obey demands by the state's Department of Motor Vehicles that it stop picking up San Francisco passengers in specially equipped Volvo SUVs.... (Associated Press) Negotiations over whether Uber must stop its newly launched self-driving car service in San Francisco have concluded without a clear resolution, according to California transportation regulators. The state has threatened legal action if the ride-hailing company continues to pick up passengers in a handful of cars without having gone through a permitting process. Uber says the cars are exempt from the permit requirement because they have a backup driver behind the wheel who must monitor the car's performance. State officials had a \\"positive conversation\\" Thursday with Uber about \\"how the company plans to comply with state regulations for self-driving vehicles,\\" Melissa Figueroa, a spokeswoman for California's State Transportation Agency, told The Associated Press. Talks will resume Friday morning, she said. Uber did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Meanwhile, the cars could be seen traveling San Francisco's streets Thursday evening. RED LIGHT WARNING The two sides met privately in Sacramento the same day that dash cam video posted online showed a self-driving Uber run a red light on Wednesday, the same day the company launched the pilot program with several Volvo SUVs. On Thursday, Uber said in a written statement that the driver was suspended and attributed the infraction in front of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to \\"human error.\\" That was an apparent reference to the company's policy that employees behind the wheel of the cars must constantly monitor them and be prepared to take over if the technology stops working, or is about to do something dangerous or illegal. Far from playing defense, Uber offered the driver's failure as evidence of the need to continue pushing ahead a technology that proponents say will one day drive far more safely than humans. \\"This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers,\\" the company said in a written statement, which said the red light-running car was not one of those in its pilot program and was not carrying passengers. Getting a permit is not a complicated or lengthy process, and regulators would likely approve Uber's application, as they have permits for 20 other companies. Instead, Uber has insisted it will not apply out of principle, saying its cars do not meet the state's legal definition of an \\"autonomous vehicle\\" and therefore do not need a permit. Though the cars are tricked out with sensors so they can steer, accelerate and brake, and even decide to change lanes, Uber says they are not nearly good enough to drive without human monitoring. And, according to Uber's reading of state law, that means they are not, legally speaking, \\"autonomous vehicles\\" that need special state permission. PUSHING THE LEGAL LIMIT Pushing legal boundaries is a proud tradition at Uber. During its meteoric rise into a multibillion dollar company, Uber has argued with authorities in California and around the world about issues including driver criminal background checks and whether those drivers should be treated as contractors ineligible for employee benefits. Both the California Department of Motor Vehicles and its parent transportation agency insist Uber is wrong — and hours after the self-driving service's launch the state sent a letter saying the service was illegal because it lacked the permits. \\"If Uber does not confirm immediately that it will stop its launch and seek a testing permit, DMV will initiate legal action,\\" DMV Chief Counsel Brian Soublet wrote the company. He referenced the possibility of taking Uber to court. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee joined the chorus of officials denouncing the move, calling it unlawful and ill-advised in a statement. Lee said he was worried about the safety of the city's cyclists and pedestrians, especially with the experiment launching in a week when streets are slick with rain. Meanwhile, the company is sending another message to California: Other places want us if you don't. In a blog post Wednesday, the leader of its self-driving efforts, Anthony Levandowski, warned that \\"complex rules and requirements could have the unintended consequence of slowing innovation\\" and named several places outside California he characterized as being \\"pro technology.\\" ___ Pritchard reported from Los Angeles.

He grew up in an eight-story house at 10 West 54th Street, the tallest private residence ever built in the city. Rockefeller was the youngest of six children born to financier John Davison Rockefeller Jr. and socialite Abigail Greene \\"Abby\\" Aldrich. John Jr. was the only son of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia \\"Cettie\\" Spelman. In 1964, along with other American business figures such as Sol Linowitz, Rockefeller founded the non-profit International Executive Service Corps which encourages developing nations to promote private enterprise. In 1979, he formed the Partnership for New York City, a not-for-profit membership organization of New York businessmen. In 1992, he was selected as a leading member of the Russian-American Bankers Forum, an advisory group set up by the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to advise Russia on the modernization of its banking system, with the full endorsement of President Boris Yeltsin. Rockefeller had a lifelong association with the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) when he joined as a director in 1949. In 1965, Rockefeller and other businessmen formed the Council of the Americas to stimulate and support economic integration in the Americas. In 1992, at a Council sponsored forum, Rockefeller proposed a \\"Western Hemisphere free trade area\\", which became the Free Trade Area of the Americas in a Miami summit in 1994. His and the Council's chief liaison to President Bill Clinton in order to garner support for this initiative was through Clinton's chief of staff, Mack McLarty, whose consultancy firm Kissinger McLarty Associates is a corporate member of the Council, while McLarty himself is on the board of directors. He was also a trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, including 1948, when Alger Hiss was president. Displeased with the refusal of Bilderberg Group meetings to include Japan, Rockefeller helped found the Trilateral Commission in July 1973.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what is the russian-american bankers forum?","completion":"The text provided does not have a direct quote that defines the Russian-American Bankers Forum.

Write an article with the title: \\"Rand Paul: So what if there is an al-Qaeda state?\\"","completion":"Title: Rand Paul: So what if there is an Al-Qaeda state? Step 1: Introduction to the subject Justify: Introducing the topic and capturing the reader's attention by discussing the main issues surrounding Rand Paul's statement in context with Al-Qaeda. In the complex world of international relations and counterterrorism, it is essential for politicians to comprehend the seriousness and potential repercussions of their statements. Recently, Senator Rand Paul made a remark that has left many perplexed and alarmed: \\"So what if there is an Al-Qaeda state?\\" As a libertarian-leaning Republican with non-interventionist views, Senator Paul's comment invites us to understand his perspective and assess the possible outcomes of an Al-Qaeda state. Step 2: Explaining Rand Paul's stance and political philosophy Justify: This helps readers understand the foundation of Senator Paul's statement and his views on foreign policy. Rand Paul is known for his isolationist and non-interventionist approach to foreign policy. He believes that U.S. involvement in global conflicts ought to be minimized, as it often leads to unintended consequences and long-term entrenchment. Paul's statement on Al-Qaeda arguably stems from this philosophy, suggesting that a potential Al-Qaeda state might not constitute a direct danger to U.S. national security, therefore making intervention unnecessary. Step 3: Analyzing the dangers associated with an Al-Qaeda state Justify: To evaluate the ramifications of Rand Paul's statement, it is crucial to outline the potential threats and consequences of an Al-Qaeda-controlled territory. If an Al-Qaeda state were to be established, the consequences could be far-reaching and hazardous. Such a state would likely become a safe haven for terrorists, allowing them to plan and execute attacks against Western nations, particularly the United States. Moreover, the existence of an Al-Qaeda state would destabilize the region, potentially leading to further extremist advances and greater violence. Step 4: Discussing the role of the United States in preventing terrorist threats Justify: A key question arising from Senator Paul's statement is whether the U.S. should intervene in the interests of national security and to prevent threats like an Al-Qaeda state. The United States, along with its allies, has been actively engaged in combatting terrorism across the globe. The primary goal of these efforts is to safeguard the country and its interests by eliminating potential threats. Although Senator Paul's non-interventionist stance holds some merit, the United States cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the prospect of an Al-Qaeda state. The nation must carefully assess and respond to evolving risks, thereby ensuring its safety and protecting its populace. Step 5: Conclusion - Analyzing Rand Paul's statement in a broader context Justify: Summarize the main points raised in the article and provide a balanced view on Senator Paul's statement. Senator Rand Paul's \\"So what if there is an Al-Qaeda state?\\" remark, while rooted in his non-interventionist philosophy, raises several crucial questions about the safety and security of the United States. Though minimizing entanglement in foreign conflicts is a laudable goal, the threat posed by an Al-Qaeda state cannot be easily dismissed. A delicate balance must be struck between non-intervention and active counterterrorism initiatives. Ultimately, the well-being of the nation and international stability rely on the United States' capacity to navigate this precarious terrain."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who studied the violin and viola? is inside the article: Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn and David Zinman.

The 2010 Census is nearly under way, but don't expect an e-mail from the U.S. Census Bureau asking you personal questions in its head count of America. Cyber criminals have information about millions of people, but they don't use it against everyone. If you do get one, it's a scam. \\"Like most large organizations, we have seen e-mail scams and phishing attacks that cite the U.S. Census Bureau,\\" agency spokesman Neil Tillman wrote in an e-mail. The Census Bureau stresses that it will not request personal information from you via e-mail, such as PIN codes, passwords, Social Security numbers, credit-card numbers or other financial account information. A news-based phishing scheme like this one is one of several risks you face online. Cybercriminals have gotten craftier, often looking toward popular trends and events -- such as tax season, the mortgage meltdown and the growth of social media -- to scam people into giving them sensitive information. To protect their privacy online, computer users need to stay informed about the criminals' methods and to learn basic principles of caution. Online attackers have information on millions of consumers, said Ravi Sandhu, a professor of cyber security at the University of Texas at San Antonio. However, he added, the rate at which they can use that information is considerably lower. \\"It's a bit like a lottery. To have identity theft actually occur against you, you need to have a little bad luck. There is some comfort in numbers,\\" Sandhu said. In addition to criminal scams, corporate data breaches can leave your privacy compromised. As of September 22, there have been 379 data breaches reported by the Identity Theft Resource Center in 2009, affecting more than 13 million records. Companies with data breaches included financial institutions, travel companies, health care operations and schools. \\"It's not one or two companies that are acting irresponsibly with consumer data,\\" said Andrea Matwyshyn, a law professor who teaches technology regulation at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. \\"It's a large-scale problem where industry norms of care are arguably not adequate to address the challenges of data security optimally.\\" Safeguard your Social Security number. Exercising caution before you submit sensitive information can save you a lot of aggravation down the line. For instance, most businesses really won't need your Social Security number, the key number for identity theft, so think twice before you provide it online. Social Security numbers are used \\"to establish new lines of credit or for tax purposes. How many things are you doing online that have to do with taxes?\\" said Linda Foley, co-founder of the Identity Theft Resource Center. So before you share the information, be certain that you are on that Web site of a real company -- as opposed to an imposter conducting a phishing scheme. Also, ask yourself why a Web site would need your Social Security number, said Michael Kaiser, executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance. \\"I always encourage consumers to supply the minimum amount of information possible. A lot of times, you get these long forms and you get the little star that's required, but people are collecting other [data about you],\\" Kaiser said. \\"Don't fill it out if you don't want to.\\" Still, even visiting a legitimate Web site has its share of risks, because online attackers may inject malicious content onto them by hacking them or placing advertisements that deliver malware, Sandhu said. If a criminal does obtain your Social Security number and creates a fraudulent identity, it can be a much bigger hassle than if he or she uses your credit card number. Credit card companies often pick up the tab for fraudulent charges, and they send you a new card with a different number. It's more difficult to get a new Social Security number, and a stolen identity could affect your credit rating. Where is your information going? If you conduct an online transaction that requires you to reveal personal data, the online privacy policy will explain whether your information could be shared with third parties. A company may tell you in that policy it will share your data with its \\"trusted partners\\" and however it deems appropriate in the course of business, said Matwyshyn, editor of the upcoming book \\"Harboring Data: Information Security, Law, and the Corporation.\\" \\"That's a signal that your data is going to be licensed many times over, and it's going to be touched by a greater number of hands.\\" That becomes a problem, Matwyshyn said, because \\"you're only as good as the weakest link in the chain.\\" That is, the \\"trusted partners\\" who can access the data may not have optimal security. Storing sensitive data such as a credit card number on a business' Web site, though convenient, may also pose a risk, Matwyshyn said. \\"The longer they store that credit card number in their systems, the longer the period of time that someone else can gain unauthorized access to that credit card number,\\" she said. Privacy at the mercy of others. Even if you practice a high level of caution with how much you reveal about yourself online, other people may inadvertently expose information about you. For instance, a friend or relative may post a photo of you on a blog or social networking Web site that reveals your name, shows a street sign indicating your address and displays your car's license plate number, Kaiser said. Kaiser recommends periodically looking up your name on one or two search engines to see the personal information about you on the Internet but adds that search probably won't tell you whether someone stole sensitive information, such as your credit card, address or Social Security number. For that, monitor your credit report for suspicious activity, suggests the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act allows you to access a free credit report each year from each of the three credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. \\"Just like in health care, you should be the first one to notice when something goes wrong with you,\\" Sandhu said. \\"If you don't perceive a symptom and convey it to a physician, nobody's going to be able to help you,\\" he said. \\"So here, also, consumers need to be vigilant and watch over their accounts and look out to see if anything strange is happening.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

The DOE says girls as young as 14 will be able to get the Plan B emergency contraception without parental consent. Parents have been notified about the CATCH pilot program and how their daughters can opt out of it. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn says she supports the program because high school students are sexually active and getting pregnant. The city says about 7,000 girls get pregnant by the time they reach the age of 17. It says more than half choose to get an abortion. NYC schools already distribute free condoms to students.

Cramer: Why Disney's stock is about to bounce And while it might seem absurd to an investor who owns a few hundred shares of Disney, big institutions often need help trying to find a buyer for its stock. The positions are so massive that the brokers who were desperately looking for buyers on Wednesday couldn't find enough to take out the sellers. \\"Barring a catastrophe in the market, I think the sellers will be done tomorrow and Disney's huge buyback will mop up what's left,\\" Cramer said. It is clear to Cramer that institutions continue to sell Disney at such low prices because they no longer believe that it is a growth stock. They simply want it out of their portfolios, at any price. That is a dumb move, in Cramer's opinion. However, he understands why they are selling the stock. Many investors think that the entire media group is not worth as much as it used to be because they have less growth than most portfolio managers thought. There is no denying the fact that if Disney cannot grow its subscribers it will have to either cut prices or diversify away from cable. \\"The issue I have with the sellers is that it's not like Disney's CEO Bob Iger doesn't know this,\\" Cramer said. Iger has spent a huge amount of time and money trying to build up the movie studios and theme parks. This is evident with \\"Star Wars\\" on the horizon and Shanghai Disney's 2016 business. The company is in much better shape than Discovery, Twenty-First Century Fox, Viacom or Time Warner that all depend more on subscriber growth.

Looking at Disney from a short-term perspective is all wrong. Cramer said to instead evaluate it as a long-term company with fantastic franchises, which are all being ignored because of one line item. Cramer is willing to bet that this time next year, Disney will succeed in diversifying away from cable faster than any of the other media companies.

Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A Kuwaiti company that has been paid more than 8.5 billion to supply food and other items to the U.S. military in the Middle East has been indicted on multiple federal fraud charges, authorities announced Monday. Public Warehousing Company KSC is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, committing major fraud against the United States, making false statements, submitting false claims and wire fraud, a six-count indictment states. The company obtained contracts in May 2003, February 2005 and July 2005 to feed U.S. troops in Iraq, Kuwait and Jordan, said the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Georgia, where the charges were filed.

He talks about Jay Gatsby, the most hopeful man he had ever met. Nick's doctor suggests that he writes his thoughts down, since writing is Nick's passion. In the summer of 1922, Nick moves from the Midwest to New York after abandoning writing. He rents a small house in the North Shore village of West Egg, next to the mansion of Gatsby, a mysterious business magnate who often holds extravagant parties. One day, while Nick has dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, he is introduced to Jordan Baker by Daisy, who hopes to make a match between them. When Nick returns home, he sees Gatsby standing on the dock, reaching towards the green light coming from the Buchanan dock. Jordan tells Nick that Tom has a mistress who lives in the \\"valley of ashes\\", an industrial dumping site between West Egg and New York City. Nick and Tom visit the valley and stop at a garage owned by George Wilson and his wife, Myrtle, who is Tom's mistress. Later, Nick receives an invitation to one of Gatsby's parties.

We can only make guesses, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, because man is slowly changing all the time. Let us take an example. Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on average , men are about three inches taller. 500 years is relatively a short period of time, so we may suppose that man will continue to grow taller. Again, in the modern world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still use only about 20% of the brain's capacity . As time goes on, however, we shall have to use our brains more and more, and finally we shall need our brains more and more, and finally we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring a physical change too. The head, especially the forehead , will grow larger. Nowadays our eyes are used too much. In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a long time it is possible that man's eyes will grow stronger. On the other hand, we make use of our arms and legs less. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however, our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a lot in modern life. But what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both men and women are likely to be hairless. Perhaps all this gives the impression that future man will not be a very attractive person to look at! This may be true.However, future man will still have a lot in common with us. He will still be a person, with thoughts and feelings similar to our own. Question: Which of the following is TRUE about man in the future? - He is hairless because hair is no longer useful. - He has smaller eyes and wears better glasses. - His fingers grow weaker because he doesn't need to use them. - He thinks and feels in a different way.

What is creativity? How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea? Have we been influenced by something, processed it... What is probably true of the author of the article? - He/she is a philosopher - He/she is a creative person - not enough information - He/she is a writer The answer to this question is:","completion":"Creativity is a complex and multifaceted concept, often defined as the ability to produce or generate new, original, and valuable ideas, products, or solutions. The definition of creativity can vary depending on individual perspectives, but it generally involves a combination of original thought, skill, and effort. The concept of creativity is inherently philosophical as it raises questions about the nature of human thought, perception, and imagination. It is also subjective, meaning that what one person perceives as creative may not hold the same significance for another person. The idea of creativity, in some cases, can be simplified into a specific series of neuronal or bodily reactions that are triggered by certain stimuli, such as our environment, emotions, or previous experiences. As for the uniqueness of individual creativity, it can be argued that each person's creative abilities and expression are different due to their unique experiences, knowledge, and perspectives. The unique mix of inspiration, skill, and effort put into a creative work varies from one person to another, and even among different creative projects completed by the same person. When it comes to the origin of creative ideas, theories abound. Some believe creativity is a random occurrence, while others argue that it is the result of hard work and deep analysis of a problem. There are also theories that suggest creativity comes from a combination of conscious and unconscious thought processes, influenced by past experiences, input from our environment, and a natural inclination to look for connections and patterns.

No Answer:","completion":"Title: Fractured Memories Genre: Drama/Mystery Plot: Act 1: In a small, sleepy coastal town, two strangers, Dane and Todd, find themselves constantly crossing paths. Dane is an introverted artist in his mid-30s who has recently returned to his hometown after a decade in the city to look after his ailing mother. At the same time, Todd, a charismatic man in his early 40s, has just moved to town for a fresh start and a quieter life after a tumultuous past. Whenever Dane and Todd encounter each other, there's a sense of familiarity, but neither of them immediately admits that they recognize the other. As the two men begin to settle into their new lives, their interactions become more frequent, and the tension between them continues to grow. Act 2: Curiosity gets the better of them, and without acknowledging their past connection, Dane and Todd slowly become friends. As they spend more time together, they find that they share a love for art, leading them to collaborate on a local community project - painting a mural that represents the town's history and its people. As they work together, their bond deepens, but their shared history remains unspoken. Dane and Todd begin to reconnect with other people from their past, including Dane's high school sweetheart, Emily, and Todd's estranged brother, Marcus. These relationships start to bring back memories, forcing the two men to confront their intertwined history. Act 3: Through a series of flashbacks, the audience learns that Dane and Todd had once been best friends in their teenage years. However, a terrible accident occurred, leading to the death of their mutual friend, Luke. The incident created a rift between Dane and Todd, with each blaming the other for Luke's death. The guilt and pain of losing their friend drove them both to leave their hometown, in search of solace and a way to forget their pasts. Returning to the present, the completed mural has garnered the attention and admiration of the townspeople. But the discovery of an old newspaper article about the accident resurfaces buried emotions and forces Dane and Todd to confront their past head-on. Act 4: Realizing that they can no longer avoid their history, Dane and Todd decide to visit Luke's grave together. Both men finally admit to recognizing each other, and they reconcile their differences, expressing remorse for their actions and asking for forgiveness. Luke's tragic death becomes a catalyst for the healing process, not only for Dane and Todd, but also for their families and the entire community. As the film comes to a close, Dane and Todd continue to cherish their renewed friendship and channel their emotional growth into positive endeavors. The bond between the two men becomes a testament to the power of forgiveness and the human spirit's ability to heal and rebuild fractured relationships. The movie ends on an uplifting note as we see Dane, Todd, Emily, and Marcus gather together at the newly inaugurated community center, built around the mural that has come to symbolize the town's resilience, love, and hope for a brighter future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Eire Ghaidhealach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century. Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. Context: Warfare was common in Gaelic Ireland, as territories fought for supremacy against each other and (later) against the Anglo-Normans. Champion warfare is a common theme in Irish mythology. In the Middle Ages all able-bodied men, apart from the learned and the clergy, were eligible for military service on behalf of the king or chief. Throughout the Middle Ages and for some time after, outsiders often wrote that the style of Irish warfare differed greatly from what they deemed to be the norm in Western Europe. The Gaelic Irish preferred hit-and-run raids (the crech), which involved catching the enemy unaware. If this worked they would then seize any valuables (mainly livestock) and potentially valuable hostages, burn the crops, and escape. The cattle raid was often called a Tain Bo in Gaelic literature. Although hit-and-run raiding was the preferred tactic in medieval times, there were also pitched battles. From at least the 11th century, kings maintained small permanent fighting forces known as \\"troops of the household\\", who were often given houses and land on the king's mensal land. These were well-equipped professional soldiers made up of infantry and cavalry. By the reign of Brian Boru, Irish kings were taking large armies on campaign over long distances and using naval forces in tandem with land forces. A typical medieval Irish army included light infantry, heavy infantry and cavalry. The bulk of the army was made-up of light infantry called ceithern (anglicized 'kern'). The ceithern wandered Ireland offering their services for hire and usually wielded swords, skenes (a kind of long knife), short spears, bows and shields. The cavalry was usually made-up of a king or chieftain and his close relatives. They usually rode without saddles but wore armour and iron helmets and wielded swords, skenes and long spears or lances. One kind of Irish cavalry was the hobelar. After the Norman invasion there emerged a kind of heavy infantry called galloglaigh (anglicized 'gallo[w]glass'). They were originally Scottish mercenaries who appeared in the 13th century, but by the 15th century most large tuatha had their own hereditary force of Irish galloglaigh. Some Anglo-Norman lordships also began using galloglaigh in imitation of the Irish. They usually wore mail and iron helmets and wielded sparth axes, claymores, and sometimes spears or lances. The galloglaigh furnished the retreating plunderers with a \\"moving line of defence from which the horsemen could make short, sharp charges, and behind which they could retreat when pursued\\". As their armour made them less nimble, they were sometimes planted at strategic spots along the line of retreat. The kern, horsemen and galloglaigh had lightly-armed servants to carry their weapons into battle. Warriors were sometimes rallied into battle by blowing horns and warpipes. According to Gerald de Barri (in the 12th century), they did not wear armour, as they deemed it burdensome to wear and \\"brave and honourable\\" to fight without it. Instead, most ordinary soldiers fought semi-naked and carried only their weapons and a small round shield--Spenser wrote that these shields were covered with leather and painted in bright colours. Kings and chiefs sometimes went into battle wearing helmets adorned with eagle feathers. For ordinary soldiers, their thick hair often served as a helmet, but they sometimes wore simple helmets made from animal hides. Question: What else can you tell me about their warfare tactics? Answer:","completion":"In addition to the hit-and-run raids and pitched battles mentioned, Gaelic Irish warfare tactics also involved the use of guerrilla warfare, ambushes, and the construction of defensive structures to protect their territories. These tactics took advantage of the natural landscape, such as forests, bogs, and hills for concealment and protection. 1. Guerrilla Warfare: The Gaelic Irish were known for their effective use of guerrilla tactics against their enemies, particularly against the Anglo-Normans after their invasion. They used hit-and-run tactics, striking quickly and then retreating to the safety of their strongholds or the wilderness to avoid prolonged engagements. The goal was to harass and exhaust the enemy, rather than defeat them outright. 2. Ambushes: The Gaelic Irish warriors were experts in the art of ambush, leveraging their knowledge of the local terrain to their advantage. They would set up traps in wooded areas, narrow valleys, or near rivers to catch their enemies off-guard. They would typically position their forces in hidden locations and wait for the enemy to pass, striking them when they were most vulnerable. 3. Defensive Structures: The Gaelic Irish built defensive structures such as ringforts, crannogs (artificial islands in lakes), and cashels (stone forts) to protect their territories and deter invasion. These structures provided fortification and a defensive advantage against enemy attacks. 4. Terrain: The Gaelic Irish used the rugged Irish landscape to their advantage in warfare. They capitalized on the difficult terrain, such as forests, bogs, and mountains, to hide from and outflank their enemies. This made it challenging for their opponents, who were often unfamiliar with the landscape, to conduct effective military operations. 5. Psychological Warfare: The Gaelic Irish also employed psychological warfare to demoralize and intimidate their enemies. They did this through the use of terror tactics, such as displaying the severed heads of their enemies, and the use of fearsome battle cries and noise generated by horns and warpipes. Overall, the warfare tactics of Gaelic Ireland relied heavily on their ability to adapt to the landscape and use their knowledge of the terrain to outmaneuver and outsmart their enemies. They were highly skilled at guerrilla warfare, ambushes, and the strategic use of defensive structures. These tactics made them a formidable force for much of their history and allowed them to resist foreign domination for centuries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 19*j + 2156 - 686 = 938 for j. Solve this problem.","completion":"Let me help you solve the equation step by step, like we're telling a story to a five-year-old! We have the equation: 19*j + 2156 - 686 = 938 Step 1: First, let's put all the numbers that don't have the letter 'j' together. So, we have 2156 and -686. If you have 2156 candies and you give away 686 candies, how many candies do you have left? 2156 - 686 = 1470 Now our equation looks like this: 19*j + 1470 = 938 Step 2: We want to find out how much 'j' is, so let's get 'j' all by itself. To do that, we need to take away 1470 from both sides of the equation. It's just like sharing candies with a friend; we have to give the same amount to both sides to make it fair! So, our new equation will look like: 19*j = 938 - 1470 Step 3: Now let's figure out how much 938 - 1470 is. If you have 938 candies and your friend wants 1470 candies, how many more candies do you need to give your friend? 938 - 1470 = -532 So, our equation now looks like this: 19*j = -532 Step 4: We're almost there! Now we just need to find out what number 'j' is. We've got 19 times 'j' equals -532. Imagine we have -532 candies, and we want to split them into 19 equal parts for 'j'. To find the value of 'j', we need to divide -532 by 19. -532 ÷ 19 = -28 That's it, we found out that 'j' is -28! So our answer is: j = -28"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide 50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

How do you do this: Safely clean thin vase.","completion":"Safely cleaning a delicate, thin vase requires a gentle approach and the use of appropriate tools to avoid causing any damage to the vase. Here are some detailed steps to help you clean the thin vase effectively and safely: 1. Prepare the cleaning solution: Prepare a gentle cleaning solution using lukewarm water and a few drops of mild dishwashing liquid. Mix the solution well to create a soapy solution. 2. Place a soft towel: Lay a soft towel or rubber mat in the bottom of the sink or on the countertop to provide a cushioned surface for the vase. This prevents the vase from slipping or scratching against the surface. 3. Fill the vase with water: Carefully pour some of the cleaning solution inside the vase until it's about one-third full. Swirl the solution gently so that it coats the inner surface of the vase. This helps in loosening up any dirt or debris that have settled inside. 4. Use a bottle brush/cleaning beads: If the narrow neck of the vase prevents you from using your hand or a sponge to clean the inside thoroughly, consider using a soft, long-handled bottle brush to reach into the vase. Gently move the brush up and down and in circular motions to clean the interior without causing any scratches. Alternatively, you can use cleaning beads (such as stainless steel or silicone beads) by adding them into the vase along with the soapy solution. Swirl the beads around the inside of the vase to loosen up dirt, then carefully pour out the beads and solution. 5. Rinse the vase: Fill the vase with clean lukewarm water to rinse away the soap residue. You may need to repeat this process a few times to ensure that the vase is thoroughly rinsed. Gently swirl the water, allowing it to reach all surfaces inside the vase before pouring it out. 6. Clean the exterior: For the exterior, use a soft, non-abrasive sponge or a lint-free microfiber cloth that's been dampened with the soapy solution. Gently clean the surface, then rinse the cloth or sponge thoroughly and use it to remove any soap residue. 7. Dry the vase: Use a soft, lint-free cloth to gently dry the outside of the vase. To remove excess water from the inside, you can either let the vase air dry by placing it upside-down on a drying rack or a clean cloth, or you could use a hairdryer on a cool setting to blow air inside the vase. Be careful not to bring the hairdryer too close or use a heat setting which could damage the vase. 8. Inspect the vase: After drying, carefully inspect the vase to make sure it's clean and undamaged. If needed, you can repeat the cleaning process for any areas that weren't cleaned the first time. By following these steps, you can safely and effectively clean your thin vase, preserving its beauty and extending its lifespan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

With recent legalization battles taking place across North America, this is a story that continues to develop and unfold, making it a critical beat for many news organizations. However, before you start imagining a laid-back lifestyle and puffing away at work, there's a catch: The successful candidate must pass a drug test. This opportunity to become a marijuana journalist - or cannabis correspondent, as some are calling it - has many intrigued, including Washington Post reporter Christopher Ingraham, who tweeted about the position saying, \\"DREAM JOB SIREN.\\" The chosen journalist will cover stories for the Denver Post's dedicated marijuana news website, the Cannabist. The Cannabist, launched in 2013, has become a prominent source of news, culture, and information about marijuana. As the legal cannabis industry expands across the United States and Canada, the demand for well-rounded coverage of the rapidly changing landscape also grows. This is where the talented new hire will need to step in, taking on the responsibility of reporting on the ongoing legalization battles and any other cannabis-related topics that may arise. However, don't be too quick to assume this job posting is a stoner's dream. The advertisement for the position takes a firm stance on drug testing, stating, \\"As with every Denver Post position, a qualified candidate must successfully pass a drug test.\\" This requirement means that even though the journalist will be covering stories about cannabis, they cannot partake in the very subject they report on. So, who is the ideal candidate for this unique position? The Denver Post is looking for a data journalist who has experience creating maps, charts, and graphs. Such skills will be crucial for presenting information about the marijuana industry, legislation, and consumer trends in a clear, engaging, and visual manner. The person selected for this role will be diving into the complexities of the legal cannabis industry, exploring how it is evolving and the impact of related policies, economic shifts, and social changes. They will be at the forefront of reporting on matters that are shaping public opinion, influencing business decisions, and affecting everyday lives. In short, this is an opportunity to become a part of history as it unfolds, contributing to a greater understanding of the marijuana landscape both nationally and internationally. Despite the drug test requirement, this position offers a unique opportunity for a skilled and passionate journalist to cover a rapidly evolving industry and become a significant voice in the ongoing narrative surrounding cannabis. For the right candidate, it could indeed be the \\"DREAM JOB\\" that many could only hope for.

Please answer the following question: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change. Pouring the liquid into beaker T, she observes a change in the liquid. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which beaker had a reactant poured into it? Hint: A catalyst works by providing a lower energy pathway from reactants to products. The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier. A:","completion":"Beaker T had a reactant poured into it. The chemist poured two different liquids into the beakers, with the same amount of the starting solution in both. In beaker R, there was no noticeable change after the liquid was poured in. This implies that the liquid added to beaker R did not react with the initial solution. However, in beaker T, a change in the liquid was observed after pouring the liquid. This suggests that the liquid added to beaker T caused a reaction to occur with the initial solution. The hint provided describes the role of catalysts in lowering the activation energy for reactions by providing a lower energy pathway. In this case, the reaction in beaker T could have been facilitated by the presence of a catalyst, leading to observable changes in the solution. In conclusion, based on the observations and information provided, beaker T had a reactant poured into it which initiated a reaction with the original solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering How would Others feel as a result? A:","completion":"When Kendall finds your keys after you have asked everyone to help you find them, various feelings and reactions may arise among the individuals involved. The emotions experienced by others would vary based on individual personalities, level of involvement, and emotional investment in the situation. Here is a detailed description of how others might feel as a result: 1. Relieved: Everyone involved in the search for your keys would likely feel a sense of relief that the keys have been found. Losing a crucial item, such as keys, can create stress and worry among the involved parties, and finding them ultimately alleviates these emotions. 2. Appreciative: The people who were actively searching for the keys might feel appreciative towards Kendall, recognizing their efforts and contribution to resolving the issue. They may view Kendall's successful discovery as a positive outcome for everyone. 3. Disappointed: Some individuals who invested time and energy into the search might experience a slight disappointment that they were unable to find the keys themselves. This feeling could stem from personal pride or from a genuine desire to help you. 4. Grateful: As the person who lost the keys, you may feel grateful towards Kendall for finding them. This gratitude is typically accompanied by relief and may reinforce a positive bond between you and Kendall. 5. Competitive: Certain individuals driven by competition might feel inspired to perform better in future situations where they could be of assistance. In this case, Kendall's success could act as motivation for them to improve their problem-solving and observational skills. 6. Intrigued: Observers who took a more passive role in the search, or those who heard about your situation, may feel intrigued about how Kendall managed to find the keys. They might be curious to learn more about Kendall's methods or strategies for future reference. 7. Inspired: In some cases, Kendall's successful effort may inspire others to adopt a more proactive approach to solving problems. Witnessing someone else's success in addressing a seemingly challenging situation can often serve as a catalyst for personal growth. 8. Empathetic: Some individuals may feel empathy towards you, understanding your concern and frustration when the keys were lost. They might identify with the emotions you experienced during the incident and feel relieved alongside you. In conclusion, the emotions and reactions of others as a result of Kendall finding your keys would be diverse, ranging from relief and gratitude to disappointment and competitiveness. The degrees to which these emotions and reactions are experienced would depend on an individual's personality, their level of involvement, and their emotional connection to the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Matt had issues controlling his anger, what did he do when someone set him off? Possible A: destroy enemy, punch, cool off, write letter, illustrate point Why is \\"punch\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Punch\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for a few reasons: 1. Human emotions and reactions: Anger is a powerful human emotion that can lead to aggressive behavior. When someone is feeling angry, they may have a strong urge to express their emotions physically, especially if it feels justified or in response to a perceived threat or severe annoyance. Punching is an example of a physical manifestation of anger, and it's something that humans might do when they feel overwhelmed by their emotions. 2. Pattern recognition: People tend to associate aggressive actions with anger based on their own experiences, observations of the behavior of others, and information gathered from media, such as movies, television shows, or stories. We often see characters in these contexts who get angry and unleash their frustration through physical violence, including punching. This correlation between anger and punching has become ingrained in our understanding of human behavior, leading us to consider it as a plausible response for someone dealing with anger issues. 3. Quick, impulsive response: Punching is a relatively fast and simple action, allowing someone to immediately release physical tension and frustration when provoked. It doesn't require much thought or planning, making it a common impulsive response for people who struggle with anger management. When someone feels like they've been pushed to their limit, the urgency and simplicity of a punch can make it an accessible and enticing option. However, it's worth noting that this answer doesn't factor in the potential legal or ethical consequences of such an action. 4. Cultural influence: Different societies may tolerate or even encourage certain aggressive behaviors as a way of dealing with anger. A culture that promotes expressing anger through physical actions can lead people to see punching as a socially acceptable or even expected response to provocation. While \\"punch\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense given the reasons listed above, it's important to acknowledge that physical violence is not a healthy or productive way to handle anger. In order to avoid potential harm to oneself and others, it's crucial to develop healthy coping mechanisms for managing anger, such as mindfulness techniques, therapy, or engaging in positive outlets like exercise or creative expression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Wave pools are often a major feature of water parks. Siam Park City Water Park in Thailand is home to the world's largest wave pool certified by Guinness World Records, and Siam Park (Tenerife) in Spain is home to the biggest man made waves (about 3 meters (9.8 ft)) in the world. - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public. - The American Museum of Natural History (abbreviated as AMNH), located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, is one of the largest museums in the world. Located in park-like grounds across the street from Central Park, the museum complex comprises 28 interconnected buildings housing 45 permanent exhibition halls, in addition to a planetarium and a library. The museum collections contain over 33 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains, and human cultural artifacts, of which only a small fraction can be displayed at any given time, and occupies more than . The museum has a full-time scientific staff of 225, sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year, and averages about five million visits annually. - The Upper West Side, sometimes abbreviated UWS, is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, that lies between Central Park and the Hudson River and between West 59th Street and West 110th Street. The Upper West Side is sometimes also considered by the real estate industry to include the neighborhood of Morningside Heights. - In physics, a standing wave also known as a stationary wave is a wave in a medium in which each point on the axis of the wave has an associated constant amplitude. The locations at which the amplitude is minimum are called nodes, and the locations where the amplitude is maximum are called antinodes. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.

After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Among the guests are members of The Joy Luck Club, their daughters, other relatives, and friends. The characters narrate their journeys while they reflect upon their pasts. The Joy Luck Club was formed by four women; Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin), Ying-Ying St. Clair (France Nuyen), An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh), in San Francisco. The members have mainly played mahjong and told each other's stories over the years. They immigrated from China, remarried, and gave birth to children in America.

Options: - box of crackers - face - rug - table - floor Explain why a human would choose \\"table\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"table\\" to answer the question above because it is the most logical and relevant option considering the context provided. Firstly, the context of the question relates to dinner being finished and the dishes cleared, which implies that the setting is a dining environment. In a dining environment, people usually eat their meals on tables. Therefore, it is highly likely that any crumbs created during the meal would be on the table, as opposed to other unrelated options like the box of crackers, face, or rug. Secondly, the role of the busboy is also relevant here. In restaurants and similar dining establishments, the busboy's job is to clear, clean, and reset the tables for new guests. Wiping off the crumbs is an essential part of this process to ensure that the table is clean and presentable for the next guests. Finally, the other options provided either do not fit the context or are not the busboy's responsibility. A box of crackers would not need to be wiped clean of crumbs, as they are typically a sealed container. Wiping a face with crumbs on it is not a busboy's responsibility and would be considered a personal hygiene task that individuals would handle themselves. Cleaning the rug or floor of crumbs could be part of general housekeeping duties in a dining establishment, but it is not typically a busboy's primary role. Cleaning the rug or floor is also not directly related to preparing the table for the next guest. Considering the setting, the busboy's job, and the relevancy of the options, a human would choose \\"table\\" as the most appropriate answer to the question provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Greek Mythology the Hydra had how many heads?","completion":"In Greek mythology, the Hydra is a multi-headed serpent-like water monster that dwelled in the marshes of Lerna, near Argos. It is well-known for its ability to regenerate heads after they had been chopped off. The exact number of its heads varies among different sources, but the most commonly cited number is nine. However, it's crucial to emphasize that the Hydra's number of heads varies across different accounts of the story. The Hydra is most famously mentioned in the story of the Twelve Labors of Heracles (also known as Hercules). It is the second labor that Heracles must complete, after the Nemean Lion. In the original Greek myth, Hera, the queen of gods, raised the Hydra as a means of vengeance against Heracles, Zeus's illegitimate son. She did this in hopes that the Hydra would eventually kill Heracles, as he was a constant reminder of her husband's disloyalty. In the tale of the Twelve Labors, Eurystheus, Heracles' cousin, ordered him to slay the Hydra. As Heracles went to face the monstrous beast, he quickly discovered the Hydra's regeneration ability. For each head he cut off, two more grew back in its place. Seemingly unable to kill the monster, Heracles then gets help from his nephew Iolaus. Iolaus suggests using fire to cauterize the neck stumps, thereby preventing the Hydra's regenerative power to grow new heads. Together, they manage to defeat the beast, but not without complications. During the battle, a giant crab emerges to help the Hydra by biting Heracles' foot. He crushes the crab and continues fighting the Hydra. Eventually, Heracles severs the last head, which is typically described as immortal, and buries it under a heavy rock. This final head could not regenerate, so the Hydra was finally defeated. As mentioned earlier, the Hydra's number of heads varies depending on the source. Some accounts mention fifty or even one hundred heads. Interestingly, the original depiction of the Hydra from ancient Greek pottery suggests that the monster had only one head and multiple snakes emerging from its body. As the story evolved over time, so did the number of its heads. Nonetheless, the Hydra remains one of the most famous monsters in Greek mythology, symbolizing the persistence of challenges, which continue to arise even after overcoming them. Heracles' battle with the Hydra still serves as a metaphor for facing never-ending trials and tribulations."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Who takes Jenny Schilt into the castle? Answer the above question based on the context below: One evening near the small Serbian village of Stetl, early in the nineteenth century, schoolmaster Albert Müller witnesses his wife Anna taking a little girl, Jenny Schilt, into the castle of Count Mitterhaus, a reclusive nobleman rumored to be a vampire responsible for the disappearances of other children. The rumours prove true, as Anna, who has become Mitterhaus' willing acolyte and mistress, gives Jenny to him to be drained of her blood.

Nick Williams, Blaine Scully, Sion Bennett, Kris Dacey, Willis Halaholo and man-of-the-match Matthew Morgan scored the other home tries. Meanwhile, Ian McKinley and Angelo Esposito both crossed for Treviso. It was a much-needed return to form for the Welsh side who had not won in the Pro12 since Boxing Day. There was little sign of them cutting loose in the first half, however, despite an early 25-metre charge from Williams and a late close-range corner effort from Scully. McKinley, Treviso's Irish fly-half, danced over for a try while half-back partner and former Osprey Tito Tebaldi added the conversion to his two penalties. The second half was virtual one-way traffic as the Blues came out firing on all cylinders, running the ball from their own 22. Shingler, Bennett and Dacey all crossed inside ten minutes, Dacey finishing off after a spectacular solo run from Morgan, and Shingler converted them all to seal the result. Esposito pulled a try back with Tebaldi converting, but it was only a temporary hold-up to a dominant Cardiff Blues second-half performance. Cuthbert's blistering break-out from defence put Halaholo over, Morgan strolled over unopposed and Cuthbert got on the scoresheet himself with a 35-metre run in the final move, to rousing applause from the Cardiff faithful. Man of the match Matthew Morgan told BBC Wales Sport: \\"We knew they were going to be tough first half, we had to wear them down and keep hold of the ball second half and it paid off, the rewards came. \\"The coaches gave us permission to go out and just play from our own 22 which I wasn't complaining about, it worked and we had a couple of tries from it. \\"Great response from Alex Cuthbert (to criticism of his Wales performance), he just kept his mouth shut and got on with it, to prove what a great player he is, I couldn't be more chuffed for him. \\"We just have to keep chipping away (in mid-table), a big game up in Edinburgh next week, another tricky side and they're not going to go away for the full 80 minutes.\\" Cardiff Blues: Matthew Morgan; Alex Cuthbert, Willis Halaholo, Steve Shingler, Blaine Scully; Gareth Anscombe, Lloyd Williams (capt); Rhys Gill, Kristian Dacey, Taufa'ao Filise, George Earle, Jarrad Hoeata, Macauley Cook, Sion Bennett, Nick Williams Replacements: Matthew Rees, Corey Domachowski, Scott Andrews, James Down, Kirby Myhill, Tomos Williams, Garyn Smith, Tom James Treviso: Luca Sperandio, Andrea Pratichetti, Michael Tagicakibau, Tommaso Allan, Angelo Esposito, Ian McKinley, Tito Tebaldi, Federico Zani, Luca Bigi, Tiziano Pasquali, Filo Paulo, Dean Budd (capt), Marco Lazzaroni, Francesco Minto, Robert Barbieri.

During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed.

Putin had been absent from the public eye for over 10 days, prompting rumors about his health. During the meeting, he seemed relaxed and smiled easily, dispelling any concerns about his well-being. When questioned about the rumors, Putin jokingly stated that \\"it would be boring without gossip.\\" Following the meeting, Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev commented on Putin's health via Twitter, reportedly stating that Putin drove him around the grounds himself after their discussion in St. Petersburg. Despite being out of the public eye, Putin still managed to raise international tensions. In a recent statement aired on state television, he confirmed that it was Russian forces who seized control of Ukrainian military buildings during the 2014 Crimea crisis. Moreover, Putin admitted that Russia had been prepared to place its nuclear weapons on alert during the Crisis, a revelation that would undoubtedly increase global concern."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Australia Context: In 1939, Lady Sarah Ashley travels from England to northern Australia to force her philandering husband to sell his faltering cattle station, Faraway Downs. Her husband sends an independent cattle drover, called \\"Drover\\", to transport her to Faraway Downs. Lady Sarah's husband is murdered shortly before she arrives, and the authorities tell her that the killer is an Aboriginal elder, \\"King George\\". Meanwhile, cattle station manager Neil Fletcher is trying to gain control of Faraway Downs, so that Lesley 'King' Carney will have a complete cattle monopoly, giving him negotiating leverage with an Australian army officer, Captain Dutton, who wants to buy the cattle. The childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the boy Nullah, who has an Aboriginal mother and a white father. Nullah tells her that he has seen her cattle being driven onto Carney's land â in other words, stolen from her. Because of this Fletcher mistreats Nullah and threatens him and his mother, so Lady Sarah fires Fletcher and decides to try to run the cattle station herself. When Nullah and his mother hide from the authorities in a water tower, his mother drowns. Lady Sarah comforts Nullah by singing the song \\"Over the Rainbow\\" from the film The Wizard of Oz. Nullah tells her that \\"King George\\" is his grandfather, and that like the Wizard, he too is a \\"magic man\\". Lady Sarah persuades Drover to take the cattle to Darwin for sale. Drover is friendly with the Aborigines, and therefore shunned by many of the other whites in the territory. It is revealed that he was married to an Aboriginal woman, who died after being refused medical treatment in a hospital because of her race. Lady Sarah also reveals she is unable to have children. Drover leads a team of six other riders, including Lady Sarah, Drover's Aboriginal brother-in-law Magarri, Nullah, and the station's accountant Kipling Flynn, to drive the 1,500 cattle to Darwin. They encounter various obstacles along the way, including a fire set by Carney's men that scares the cattle, resulting in the... Answer:","completion":"The cattle station manager in the movie \\"Australia\\" is Neil Fletcher.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Emma Thomas. PUBLISHED:. 09:12 EST, 8 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 09:39 EST, 8 November 2013. An entrepreneur says hackers stole 1million of the virtual currency bitcoin from his website. The Australian man, who refused to be identified citing fears for his safety, said thieves compromised his site and took a haul of virtual currency. Bitcoin is a digital-only currency traded from computer to computer and is usually used to pay for goods online. Theft: 1million bitcoins were stolen from an Australian man's website. The alleged theft is one of the largest since bitcoin was created four years ago. Bitcoin has no central authority and is not backed by governments or banks. A bitcoin user who calls himself TradeFortress told ABC more than 4,100 bitcoins worth about 1.1million (£585,000) were stolen from him. He says he is not much older than 18 and he knows the chances of getting any of the digital currency back is unlikely because all bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed. As the transactions are all anonymous, speculation has arisen that this was an inside job and TradeFortress took the coins for himself. However, the young man strenously denied the allegations - but admitted he was unlikely to report the theft to police. Digital: Bitcoin is presented as a payment method at e-commerce companies on a website in Berlin. 'The police don't have access to any more information than any user does when it comes to bitcoin. Some say it gives them control of their money,' he explained. The 1.1million bitcoins were owned by users of his website who had trusted him to look after their digital currency. A spokesman for the Australian Federal Police says to his knowledge, a theft of bitcoins has never been investigated but if it was reported to officers then police would investigate it like any other theft. Experts say as the popularity of bitcoins increases, thieves will look to hack into the system and exploit the currency's anonymous nature. Stilgherrian, a technology commentator, said unlike stocks or bonds, bitcoins are very hard to trace. 'Once you've got the bitcoin there's no way, well no easy way, of telling where you got that from,' he said. 'So from a money laundering point of view, it's very attractive. Going mainstream? A customer uses the world's first ever permanent bitcoin ATM unveiled at a coffee shop in Vancouver, Canada. 'We're talking about roughly a million dollars worth of bitcoin gone. That puts it up there with some of the biggest bank robberies in history.' A bitcoin is worth about 275 (£161). At the beginning of the year, they were worth about 30 (£17) each. Sthilgarian says the popularity of the digital currency is making stealing it more attractive to crooks. 'People rob banks because that's where the money is, your bitcoin wallet which is really just a digital file sitting on your computer, can be just as vulnerable and just as attractive,' he said. 'And the more of it that is out there, the more thieves will be drawn to it.' What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This article is about an Australian man who lost 1 million worth of bitcoins from his website due to hackers.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Needs Improvement Review: I recently downloaded the ro.weednet.contactssync app, expecting a seamless solution for syncing my contacts across devices. Unfortunately, the experience has been underwhelming and the app has left much to be desired. Firstly, the user interface is quite outdated and unintuitive, making it difficult to navigate through the app. The process of importing and exporting contacts took much longer than expected, and frequent app crashes only added to the frustration. Another issue I faced was the lack of clear instructions on how the app works and how to resolve any issues. The app doesn’t provide a comprehensive tutorial or FAQs section, which left me feeling stranded when facing problems. Lastly, customer support was rather unresponsive. I reached out for assistance via email, but it took several days to receive a generic response that failed to address my concerns. While the concept of ro.weednet.contactssync is promising, the app's poor execution makes it difficult to use effectively. I'm giving this app 2 stars, hoping that its developers will invest in necessary improvements. Until then, I’m unable to recommend it to others and can only suggest exploring alternative solutions for contact management and syncing."},{"prompt":"Q: I heard that Carson waited to go back in the restaurant till their friends arrived there.

Step 3: Isolate the variable In order to isolate s, we need to remove the variable term from one side of the equation. Since 6*s is on both sides of the equation, we can subtract 6*s from each side to simplify the equation: 12*s - 6*s = 6*s - 6*s Step 4: Simplify the equation Now, we can simplify the equation by performing the subtraction: 6*s = 0 Step 5: Solve for the variable To find the value of s, we need to divide by the coefficient of s, which in this case is 6: (6*s)/6 = 0/6 Now, the equation is simplified to: s = 0 So, the solution for the equation 12*s = 6*s is s = 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Where is the author looking to get a job ?","completion":"The author seems to be exploring various job avenues that could make use of their PhD degree. While they appear to be less interested in pursuing a research tenure-track position, mainly due to limited financial compensation and the requirement for a high level of dedication in the particular field of research, they acknowledge that there are other opportunities to consider, which could be satisfying and make the most of their doctorate. Here are the areas the author mentioned that they might be looking to get a job in: 1. Academic translation: With a PhD, the author might have the necessary qualifications, background, and expertise to work as a translator in academia. This job would involve using their fluency in multiple languages to translate academic articles, books, conference papers, and other research materials. Academic translators play a significant role in facilitating global communication and collaboration among scholars, allowing research findings to reach a broader audience. 2. Non-tenure track teaching: As an alternative to the tenure-track, the author is considering to teach in a non-tenure track position. These roles, also known as adjunct faculty, usually entail teaching courses at colleges or universities on a contract basis. Non-tenure track positions tend to offer greater flexibility, as well as reduced emphasis on scholarly research compared to tenure-track faculty roles. However, it should be noted that these positions can also have less job security and lower pay, although they can still provide valuable professional experience for those with a PhD. 3. Teaching overseas: With their educational background and international experience, the author might be considering pursuing a teaching career aboard. This could open doors to teaching positions at universities or international schools in various countries. Teaching overseas exposes individuals to different educational environments, cultural experiences and provides opportunities for personal growth through traveling and immersion in a foreign community. 4. Study abroad/area studies advising: Drawing upon their expertise in specific regions or subjects, the author is considering a career in study abroad advising or working with area studies programs. In this role, they would be responsible for guiding students and faculty in selecting and planning study abroad experiences, developing and organizing international programs, and facilitating international partnerships with other universities. This career path often requires a combination of strong language skills, cultural knowledge, and higher education experience, which the author might already possess by virtue of their PhD. Overall, it appears that the author is looking for job opportunities that would allow them to utilize their education and skills in alternative ways, beyond a traditional research tenure-track position. They seem to value the flexibility, diversity, and potential for personal and professional growth that these alternative career paths can offer."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Context: The art of carpet weaving was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism, and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters. The weaving of such carpets originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and was eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs and kilims not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to mosques, which often amassed large collections of them.

New research from Holland suggests that good conversational flow has a powerful effect on people’s feelings of self-esteem and belonging, and that even brief — just four seconds long — silences during a conversation are enough to, as Tom Jacobs puts it in Miller-McCune: …elicit primal fears, activating anxiety-provoking feelings of incompatibility and exclusion. “Conversational flow is associated with positive emotions, and a heightened sense of belonging, self-esteem, social validation and consensus,” a research team led by psychologist Namkje Koudenburg writes in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. “Disrupting the flow by a brief silence produces feelings of rejection and negative emotions.” For the study, researchers performed two experiments in which they studied participants’ responses to awkward silences. In the first, 102 college students read one of two stories. The first version described someone making an insensitive remark — “I think obese people should pay for two seats on the bus” — which was followed by an obvious silence. In the alternate story, conversation flowed easily after the remark. The students were asked to imagine themselves as being the person who made the faux pas. Not surprisingly, they reported feeling more anxious, rejected and less self-assured in the scenario with the awkward silence than in the alternate version. The second experiment involved 60 undergrads watching videos of similar alternate scenarios, but in this case, the questionable remark took place in a conversation about relationships and involved the topic of sex between students and professors. In one case, the statement was followed by a four-second silence; in the other version, conversation continued to flow smoothly. Although the videos contained no other cues about the silence and viewers weren’t even consciously aware of the pause, students who viewed the version that contained the break in conversation again reported greater feelings of rejection and lower self-esteem. The researchers suggest that sensitivity toward signs of rejection and exclusion arose during our evolutionary history — one in which being excluded from a group could literally mean the difference between life and death. These days, luckily, the consequences of social rejection are typically far less dire — even if it doesn’t feel that way at the time. ||||| Remarks that stop the conversation cold at social gatherings can instantly elicit deep-seated feelings of exclusion. Why are those few seconds of an awkward silence so incredibly uncomfortable? (sjlocke/istockphoto) It’s the moment everyone dreads at holiday social gatherings. You’re enjoying a free-flowing, spontaneous conversation with a group of friends, colleagues or family members, until you inject what you think is a clever, or at least interesting, remark. The result is an awkward, almost unbearable silence, which lasts until someone jumps in to fill the verbal void with something — anything. Why are those few soundless seconds so incredibly uncomfortable? Newly published research suggests they elicit primal fears, activating anxiety-provoking feelings of incompatibility and exclusion. “Conversational flow is associated with positive emotions, and a heightened sense of belonging, self-esteem, social validation and consensus,” a research team led by psychologist Namkje Koudenburg writes in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. “Disrupting the flow by a brief silence produces feelings of rejection and negative emotions.” Koudenburg, who is on the faculty of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, conducted two studies that support this conclusion. In the first, 102 participants (all undergraduates) read a story and were asked to imagine themselves as the narrator. At one point, the narrator, who is having a conversation with friends, makes a mildly controversial statement (“I think obese people should pay for two seats on the bus”). Half the students read a version of the story in which “one of the fellow students smoothly continued the conversation on the previous topic, making no further reference regarding this statement.” The others were informed that the remark led to a short pause (“Briefly, it remains silent. Suzanne stirs her coffee”). The participants then reported the degree to which they felt a series of emotions, including anger and fear, as well as their level of self-esteem. Those in the “disrupted-flow condition” — that is, those who imagined themselves in the position of someone whose remark had landed with a thud — “felt significantly more rejected and reported more negative emotions,” the researchers report. “Flowing conversations are associated with higher feelings of belonging, control, self-esteem, social validation and perceived consensus,” the researchers write. “Furthermore, disrupted conversations increase negative emotions and feelings of rejection, resembling ostracism experiences. This indicates that a brief disruption of conversational flow is interpreted as rejection, even when nobody is factually excluded from the conversation.” In a second study, 60 undergraduates watched one of two six-minute videos, during which one participant in a conversation makes a controversial remark. In the first version of the video, “the other group members smoothly continued the conversation” by moving to a different topic. In the second, “the statement was followed by four seconds of silence, after which the conversation continued.” The participants “did not consciously detect the silence,” the researchers report. (Their estimate of how much time elapsed between the statement in question and the next statement out of someone’s mouth was the same, no matter which of the videos they watched.) But they noted it on an unconscious level, with those who observed the pause reporting “more rejection, more negative emotions and less positive emotions.” “A mere four-second silence suffices to disrupt the conversational flow, and make one feel distressed, afraid, hurt and rejected,” the researchers write. These results suggest “groups that converse harmoniously make people feel they belong,” the researchers conclude. “People do not always actively search for opinions of others, but they can validate their opinions by deriving a general feeling of consensus from fluent conversations.” When that fluency is disrupted, those positive feelings of belonging instantly evaporate, leaving the person who made the awkward remark metaphorically out in the cold. Koudenburg and her colleagues note this is laboratory-based rather than real-world research, but they add they would expect “stronger effects may be observed in real-life situations.” After all, actually feeling ostracized is more intense than imagining yourself in that position. So at your next holiday party, if someone says something off the wall and stops the conversation cold, be kind. This research suggests the discomfort he or she is experiencing goes surprisingly deep. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a brief explanation of the main points or ideas in a text, story, or conversation.

Movie title: Saw V Movie plot: The film starts with Seth (Joris Jarsky ) in the pendulum trap. It is revealed Seth is a murderer who was released early from prison due to a technicality. Seth is told by Jigsaw's puppet that if he wants to live he has to destroy the things he has used to kill-his hands.The trap is later revealed to be unwinnable, but Seth is made to believe that the aim of the trap is for him to push buttons inside of two devices which would crush both of his hands before a bladed pendulum (intended to slice him in half) descends upon him. Seth had in fact, crushed his hands, but as the trap is unwinnable, the Pendulum does not stop. From the side of the room, somebody watches Seth getting sliced in half through a peep hole.Meanwhile, Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) shoots Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) and enters the room where Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) died. After investigating and finding Jigsaw's corpse, the door is locked on Strahm by Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor). Strahm finds a hidden door in the room and kicks it open. The outlines of the door had been painted with glow in the dark paint, only visible in the dark. The door leads down a new hallway. Strahm finds a tape recorder and plays it. Jigsaw's voice addresses him on the recording and warns him not to proceed, but to stay where he is, stating that he can find salvation or let his \\"insatiable hunger to uncover the truth drive (him) deeper in the abyss.\\" Jigsaw urges him to make the right choice. Strahm disregards the warning and leaves the room, walking down the hallway. He is soon attacked by a figure in a pig mask, presumably Hoffman. He wakes to find himself in one of Jigsaw's traps. His head is in a sealed box, which quickly starts to fill with water. Before he runs out of air, he performs a tracheotomy with the tube of a ballpoint pen in order to breathe.

The lack of action by the Turkish government sparked outrage among the Kurdish community, as they felt abandoned by their neighbor in their time of need. Demonstrations broke out in cities across Turkey, with protesters demanding that the government provide assistance to the Kurdish fighters in Kobani. The protests highlighted the longstanding tensions between Turkey and the Kurdish population. Turkey has been reluctant to support the Kurds in their fight against ISIS due to the complicated history between the two sides. The Kurdish population has long demanded greater autonomy and recognition of their rights, which has led to conflict with the Turkish government. The situation in Kobani illustrated the complex dynamics of the region, with multiple forces operating with different interests and objectives. While the Kurdish fighters in Kobani were locked in a desperate battle against ISIS, the divided international response highlighted the shifting allegiances and power struggles at play. Turkey's decision to allow Peshmerga forces from Iraq to enter Kobani, despite their reservations, demonstrated the increasing international pressure on the Turkish government to act. The agreement with Turkey marked a significant development in the Kurdish fight against ISIS, as the additional Peshmerga fighters played a crucial role in reinforcing the Kurds in Kobani. Ultimately, the protests in Turkish streets served to bring attention to the plight of the Kurdish people, and the fragile and complex relationships at play in the region. The intersection of politics, territorial disputes, and humanitarian concerns made for a highly charged and delicate situation, with the fate of Kobani hanging in the balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Just 50,000. That was the humble fundraising goal Ryan Grepper set on July 8, lowering his expectations for the second Kickstarter campaign for his Coolest Cooler creation, a high-tech cooler jam-packed with all sorts of fun gizmos -- from a built-in ice crushing blender to Bluetooth speakers and a USB charger. See, the first time Grepper took to the crowdfunding site -- back in November 2013 -- his goal was far more ambitious: 125,000. Yet, after an encouraging strong start, interest in the campaign began wavering. By closing, the project managed to raise a little over 100,000 in pledges and eventually failed to hit its mark. The failure dealt a blow to Grepper's confidence -- but the entrepreneur, who describes himself as \\"part visionary, part mad scientist\\" refused to give up. Taking the lessons he'd learned from the failed campaign, Grepper re-grouped and last month re-introduced an advanced version of his creation. The result? Just over a month later: more than 8.2 million in pledges and some 41,000 backers. With 21 days still to go, Grepper's project has become the third most-funded campaign on Kickstarter ever -- and could very well hit the top spot if pledges continue to pile in. So, what was the secret behind Grepper's astonishing comeback? And what are the best tips that could help turn your business idea into a crowdfunding mega-success? To find out, CNN's Future Finance spoke to Grepper himself and Julie Wood from Kickstarter, as well as crowdfunding experts Piers Duruz and Salvador Briggman about their top tips for being a Kickstarter success. Ryan Grepper, Coolest Cooler creator. Make sure the design is visually compelling. My first Kickstarter campaign failed and I believe one of the biggest reasons was that I had not advanced the design far enough to capture the Kickstarter audience. Kickstarter is a very visual platform. When I took my design further along in the process I was better able to share my love of the Coolest and more people naturally connected. Consider the time of year when customers will be most receptive. I originally launched the Coolest in November. At the time I was thinking we might hit the Christmas shopping and tailgating audience, but what quickly became apparent was that folks were not focused on coolers in November. Relaunching in July was perfect because people are thinking about coolers during the summer and it was much easier to get exposure. This sounds obvious now, but I believe in learning from my mistakes. Develop a following before the campaign. Although my first campaign failed, I saw that some people were very interested in the Coolest. We nurtured that interest in between our first and second campaign and worked hard to grow that excitement. By the time we launched our second campaign we had a terrific core of interested backers. Now I can't believe how our group of backers has grown. Julie Wood, Kickstarter spokesperson. Make a video! Projects with videos have a higher success rate than those without. Your video doesn't have to be super pro looking. Some of our favorite project videos have a very DIY feel. Offer great rewards! Some rewards are straightforward, like a copy of the album you made. Other rewards are more creative and unique. The best projects tend to have a mix of both -- it's important to have great rewards at at all pledge levels. The most popular pledge amount on Kickstarter is 25, and the site-wide average for all pledges is about 70. Updates are a great way to build a relationship with your backer community. While your project is live, keep your backers informed about new developments and funding milestones. It'll inspire them to help you spread the word. Treat your project like a story that's unfolding before their eyes. Detailed updates like \\"Pics from last night's show!\\" or \\"We found a printer for our book!\\" are fun for everybody to follow along with. Piers Duruz, founder of Crowdfunding Dojo. Start building an email and social media audience immediately, with the promise of content that interests them for following you. Growing an audience takes time, but you can do it while you plan everything else. Even your journey to prepare can be interesting to the right people. The first 48 hours of your campaign is the most critical. If you can get your followers to visit and pledge at any time, make it right at the start. Read this: How to start your own currency. Start your promotion with the people who are closest to you and work your way out. Each group provides social proof to the next group, by showing other people have already backed you when they arrive. Salvador Briggman, founder of CrowdCrux. Don't re-invent the wheel. Study the creators that have come before you. How did they structure their Kickstarter page? What rewards did they offer? How many updates did they do throughout the campaign? In addition, by backing several popular projects in your category, you can see how other creators do backer communication and how long it takes them to fulfil their promises. Also, by browsing their list of backers, you can get an idea of whether the supporters are part of the Kickstarter community (backed multiple projects) or are first-time supporters, meaning the project drove a lot of its own traffic. Focus on emotion, but back it up with technical ability. It's no secret that part of what makes crowdfunding campaigns spread quickly and gather a supporter base is social media. Whether it's networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest ,or social bookmarking websites like Reddit, StumbleUpon, Digg, Blogs, and Tumblr, information can disseminate in a matter of hours and light up the web 2.0 news networks. What many people overlook is the reason why information spreads: it spreads when it makes a reader feel a certain way, which then makes them want to share that link. The feeling that prompts a backer to share that link could be \\"This is so cool!\\" or \\"This is an important cause.\\" It's easiest to invoke a feeling when you have a prior relationship with your backers, as is the case with the multi-million dollar \\"Reading Rainbow\\" campaign. Although ultimately, you want your backers to come away from your video and campaign feeling something, you must also back up your pitch with technical ability. What prototype have you created? Why can your team deliver on their promises? You must engage both the left and right hemisphere of the brain when crowdfunding. Everything is sales. Typically, when we think of a salesman, we think of a slimy quick-talking city slicker with too-white teeth and a 2,000 suit. These types of individuals are an instant turnoff. The best types of salesmen don't make you feel like you are being \\"sold to.\\" They have the ability to create the urge to buy. Usually this is the result of giving people what they want, or connecting problems people experience with an appropriate solution. Since you are going to be doing a lot of self-promoting, it's important that you adopt the mental mindset of your potential backers. What types of rewards would get them excited? How would they want to be pitched? What would turn them off? Read this: How to start your own currency.

I can use this background: Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as propellers and pumps, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of tidal stream turbines.When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military submarines, as it increases the chances of being detected by passive sonar. Now, I have a new situation: Stephanie and Barb are two friends that belong to a sailing club. They are having a lunch at the cafe in the club and discussing their latest boat purchases.

Now let me explain this like you're five years old: Reversible means you can use it in two different ways or directions. Imagine when you have a toy that you can turn around and use it in another way. Bihexagon angled means it has a shape with two hexagons and angled edges. Hexagons have six sides, like a beehive in a cartoon. 22 teeth are the little grabby parts that help the tool hold onto things really tight. It's like how we have teeth to bite food, but this tool has 22 teeth to grab stuff. Chrome plated means it is covered with a shiny, silver-looking layer called chrome. It makes the tool resistant to rust and adds durability. So, this tool is special because it can be used in two different ways, has two hexagon shapes, can hold onto things with its 22 teeth, and has a shiny protective layer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Before I proceed to answer, I would like to clarify that the question's structure and provided information are ambiguous for selecting a correct answer. However, I will attempt to present my thought process to arrive at an answer. The question is: \\"What can bring a stronger sun?\\" Two answer options mentioned are: 1. Sunlight 2. When the season changes To analyze these options, I need to understand the meaning of a \\"stronger sun.\\" It can mean an increase in the intensity of sunlight, temperature, or duration of exposure. Step-by-step process and justification: Step 1: Interpret the meaning of a \\"stronger sun.\\" In the context of the question, I will interpret a \\"stronger sun\\" as an increase in sunlight intensity, temperature, and duration of exposure. Step 2: Evaluate option 1 - Sunlight. Sunlight itself cannot bring a \\"stronger sun\\" because it's a result of the sun's strength, rather than a contributing factor. Step 3: Evaluate option 2 - When the season changes. Seasonal changes can influence the strength of the sun. For example, in many regions, sunlight intensity, temperature, and duration of exposure are higher during summer compared to winter. Therefore, this option seems more plausible. Based on the given context and a step-by-step analysis, it appears that the better answer to the question, \\"What can bring a stronger sun?\\" is \\"when the season changes\\" because it directly impacts the intensity, temperature, and duration of sunlight exposure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

While these Coronation splendors had been going on, Friedrich, in the Moravian regions, was making experiences of a rather painful kind; his Expedition prospering there far otherwise than he had expected. This winter Expedition to Mahren was one of the first Friedrich had ever undertaken on the Joint-stock Principle; and it proved of a kind rather to disgust him with that method in affairs of war. A deeply disappointing Expedition. The country hereabouts was in bad posture of defence; nothing between us and Vienna itself, in a manner. Rushing briskly forward, living on the country where needful, on that Iglau Magazine, on one's own Sechelles resources; rushing on, with the Saxons, with the French, emulous on the right hand and the left, a Captain like Friedrich might have gone far; Vienna itself--who knows!--not yet quite beyond the reach of him. Here was a way to check Khevenhuller in his Bavarian Operations, and whirl him back, double-quick, for another object nearer home!--But, alas, neither the Saxons nor the French would rush on, in the least emulous. The Saxons dragged heavily arear; the French Detachment (a poor 5,000 under Polastron, all that a captious Broglio could be persuaded to grant) would not rush at all, but paused on the very frontier of Moravia, Broglio so ordering, and there hung supine, or indeed went home. Friedrich remonstrated, argued, turned back to encourage; but it was in vain. The Saxon Bastard Princes \\"lived for days in any Schloss they found comfortable;\\" complaining always that there was no victual for their Troops; that the Prussians, always ahead, had eaten the country. No end to haggling; and, except on Friedrich's part, no hearty beginning to real business. \\"If you wish at all to be 'King of Moravia,' what is this!\\" thinks Friedrich justly. Broglio, too, was unmanageable,--piqued that Valori, not Broglio, had started the thing;--showed himself captious, dark, hysterically effervescent, now over-cautious, and again capable of rushing blindly headlong. 1. what kind of experiences is Friedrich having? 2. what did the princes complain about? 3. were they ahead or behindd the prussians? 4. what did the prussians do? 5. who else was hard to manage? 6. what was he mad about? 7. where did the French Detachment stop? 8. who was not interested in rushing? 9. what was one of the first Friedrich took under the Joint-stock Principle? 10. how did he feel about this?

Summarize this article: The vote - along with another by-election in Copeland taking place the same day - is being seen as a key electoral test for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose party is defending both seats. It was triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Tristram Hunt, who left Parliament to become the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Labour has chosen councillor Gareth Snell to defend a seat it has never lost since its creation. Mr Snell is a member and former leader of Newcastle-under-Lyme Council, who campaigned for a Remain vote in the EU referendum. UKIP, which narrowly beat the Conservatives into second place in the 2015 general election, is fielding its leader, Paul Nuttall, as its candidate. The MEP was born in Bootle, where he has stood in the last three general elections. The Tories have chosen 25-year-old city councillor Jack Brereton. He is the deputy leader of the Conservative Group in the council's ruling coalition, where he is also the Cabinet member for Regeneration, Transport and Heritage. The Green Party has picked Adam Colclough as their candidate, with Zulfiqar Ali standing for the Liberal Democrats. See below for a full list of candidates. The successful Liberal Democrat by-election campaign in Richmond Park in December was seen as a result of the party making Brexit a key issue in what was a very Remain constituency. The wider Stoke area (which includes Stoke Central) voted strongly to Leave in June's referendum so the question is how much of an impact Brexit is likely to have. Since being created for the 1950 general election, Stoke Central has always returned Labour MPs. It has traditionally been seen as rock solid Labour territory and Mr Hunt won in 2015 by a 5,179 margin. Labour's majority has been decreasing sharply in recent years, from 49.5% in 1997 to 16.7% in 2015. Stoke-on-Trent Central covers the administrative centre of the six Potteries towns: Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Stoke-upon-Trent and Tunstall. As BBC Midlands political editor Patrick Burns notes, this may be the last time the seat is contested. \\"For all its rich history and industrial heritage, it's set to be scrapped under proposed Parliamentary boundary changes which would reduce Stoke's present three seats to two,\\" he says. \\"And with (Labour MPs) Ruth Smeeth and Rob Flello apparently in no mood to relinquish their neighbouring seats, it's no wonder that this is being unofficially dubbed as a job for three years.\\" Mr Nuttall has admitted a previous claim that he lost \\"close personal friends\\" in the Hillsborough disaster was wrong. The UKIP candidate apologised and said the quotes on his website from 2011 were \\"wrong\\" and had been taken down. There was also a clash with Labour over whether Mr Nuttall was actually living in the Stoke house registered as his address on nomination papers. UKIP later said he had to leave the house for safety reasons after the address was circulated on social media. Mr Snell, meanwhile, has apologised after some of his old tweets about people appearing on TV shows have re-emerged, including a description of panellists on ITV's Loose Women as \\"squabbling sour-faced ladies\\" and remarks about Janet Street-Porter and a woman on the BBC's The Apprentice. The Labour candidate also previously posted disparaging remarks about his party's current leader Jeremy Corbyn and Brexit. Here is a list of the candidates, in alphabetical order by surname: Polls open at 07:00 GMT on 23 February and close at 22:00 GMT.","completion":"Stoke Central's by-election is considered a key test for UK's Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, as the party defends the historically strong Labour area.

While at work his work computer does not need modern capabilities. So, he still uses Windows 2000 at his office computer. At home it's a complete different ball game. He plays so much computer games at home that he needs a better computer. In his home computer he installed the latest version of Windows. Now, there is no lag in his system. But I can use this background: In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms. What is an answer for this question: In which computer CPU will not turn off many internal components, office computer or home computer? A:","completion":"The answer to the question: In which computer CPU will not turn off many internal components, office computer or home computer, is as follows: In the given situation, John's office computer is running Windows 2000, while his home computer has the latest version of Windows installed. Based on the information about power-saving schemes and how the System Idle Process manages the CPU power-saving mechanism, both computers have different ways of handling the power-saving features. John's office computer, which runs Windows 2000, utilizes an older power-saving scheme. On x86 processors, the idle thread in the System Idle Process will run a loop of halt instructions, causing the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Consequently, Windows 2000 operating system will turn off many internal components of the CPU in John's office computer when it is idle. On the other hand, John's home computer has the latest version of Windows installed, which employs more advanced power-saving mechanisms. In the modern versions of Windows, the idle thread in the System Idle Process interacts with the Hardware Abstraction Layer to implement different power-saving methods, such as reducing the CPU clock speed or utilizing other power-saving strategies. These contemporary methods do not necessarily turn off many internal components of the CPU, as opposed to the power-saving scheme in Windows 2000. In conclusion, the CPU in John's office computer running Windows 2000 is more likely to turn off many internal components due to its older power-saving mechanism, while his home computer running the latest version of Windows will likely use more advanced power-saving techniques that do not rely on turning off a large number of internal CPU components."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Elena's hair was brittle so Natalie suggested a hot oil treatment. Natalie knew about the wonders of a hot oil treatment, having experienced its numerous benefits with her own hair. Aware that her friend Elena was struggling with dry and lifeless hair, Natalie wanted to share this useful information and help improve the health of her friend's tresses. Natalie, who was always equipped with valuable beauty tips and tricks, decided to take the initiative and go beyond just giving advice. She brought Elena a hot oil treatment set she specifically picked out for her, knowing that it would be an excellent fit for Elena's hair type. Natalie chose a high-quality treatment composed of nourishing oils such as coconut, argan, and jojoba oils. These oils would help to replenish Elena's hair with essential nutrients and improve its overall health. Furthermore, the oils would work together to give the desired effect of soft, silky, and shiny hair. In addition, they would provide deep hydration to the hair shaft and repair damaged strands, combatting dryness due to harsh weather, heat styling, or chemical treatments. Following Natalie's suggestion, Elena tried out the hot oil treatment. She gently warmed the oil mixture, ensuring that it reached a comfortable temperature. Then, she carefully applied the warm oil to her scalp and massaged it in, stimulating blood flow and promoting hair growth. Next, she took her time working the oil through her brittle hair, coating each strand from root to tip. She allowed the treatment to sit for about 45 minutes, allowing the oils to work their magic on her brittle hair. After rinsing and gently washing her hair, Elena noticed a significant difference in the texture of her locks. Her hair felt smoother, softer, and more manageable. Thanks to Natalie's perfect recommendation, Elena's hair health began to improve. It no longer felt brittle, and the elasticity of her strands improved significantly. Of course, to maintain the results, Elena continued to perform hot oil treatments every couple of weeks, making it a regular part of her hair care routine. Not only did the hot oil treatment bring a positive change to Elena's hair, but their friendship also deepened due to Natalie's genuine concern and valuable help. The act of Natalie giving Elena the hot oil treatment to try out demonstrated her supportive and caring nature, and it brought them closer together as friends, bonding over their shared love of beauty and hair care solutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Question: what type of spider has the most eyes I found the following answer on Google: Unlike insects , spiders do not have antennae . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"No, the information provided in the answer does not directly address the question about the type of spider with the most eyes. Although it is true that spiders do not have antennae like insects, this fact is unrelated to the number of eyes a specific type of spider might have. To address the original question, spiders typically have eight eyes. However, the number of eyes can vary depending on the species. Some types of spiders may have fewer eyes, while others may have none at all. In general, spiders belong to the class Arachnida and are divided into several orders, one of which is Araneae, which consists of all true spiders. Within the order Araneae, there are over 48,000 species of spiders distributed among more than 100 families. Given the vast diversity of spiders, it can be challenging to pinpoint a single type of spider with the most eyes. However, it is worth noting that the jumping spider (family Salticidae) is known for its well-developed eyes, which provide them with excellent vision. Jumping spiders have a pair of principal (large, forward-facing) eyes and three pairs of secondary eyes on both sides and the back of their head. These eight eyes play an essential role in the spider's hunting strategies and navigation, as they can perceive depth, movement, color, and polarized light. In conclusion, while the answer provided was not correct, it is difficult to determine a single type of spider with the most eyes due to the diverse nature of the arachnid class.

We wanted to travel by cab rather than wait for the bus , but Pick from: (a). cab proved to be more unreliable for our journey.. (b). bus proved to be more unreliable for our journey..","completion":"We wanted to travel by cab rather than wait for the bus, but the cab proved to be more unreliable for our journey. It was a busy morning, and the taxi service was not properly organized. With the high demand and congestion on the streets, the few available cabs were already occupied or reserved, and we were left with no choice but to wait in the long queue for any unoccupied taxi. To make matters worse, as we spent more and more time waiting, we realized that the taxi rates had surged due to the increased demand. It became evident that getting a cab would not only be highly unpredictable but also unreasonably expensive, especially compared to the fixed-rate bus fares. At this point, we started to reconsider our options, thinking that the bus might not be such a bad choice after all. While the bus might take slightly longer due to planned stops on the route, it did provide a more structured and reliable method of transportation. Additionally, the buses ran at more frequent intervals, ensuring we would not have to wait for an extended period and could plan our departure from the bus stop more accurately. As we contemplated our options, we also started to appreciate the comfortably air-conditioned interiors of the bus and its capacity to accommodate our luggage safely. Furthermore, we realized that buses could actually offer a more environmentally friendly travel alternative, as they carried more passengers at once, thus decreasing the carbon emissions per passenger. Ultimately, we decided it was wiser to rely on the bus for our journey. Despite the initial inclination to use a cab due to the perceived convenience, the bus became a surprisingly viable and, in many ways, a more practical choice for us. It not only proved to be more reliable than a scarce and unpredictable cab service but also provided a cost-effective, comfortable, and eco-friendly means of transportation. So, the next time you find yourself in a similar situation, it's worth considering the advantages and drawbacks of each option. In some cases, a seemingly less convenient option like the bus might end up being a much better choice for your journey than initially anticipated. Always weigh the reliability, cost, comfort, and environmental factors before making your decision.

Once he was asked why he kept on trying to make a new type of battery when he had failed so often, he replied, \\"Failure? I have no failure. Now I know 50,000 ways it won't work.\\" So what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were conditions right? Were you in top form yourself? What can you change so things will go right next time? Second, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. Think about this question, \\"If I do succeed in this, where will it get me?\\" This may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway. The third thing to keep in mind about failure is that it's a part of life. Learn to \\"live with yourself\\" even though you may have failed. Even if we have failed we should _ . A) learn to forget it B) learn to remember it C) learn to enjoy it D) learn to accept it","completion":"Failure is an inevitable part of life and every individual's journey. It not only teaches us valuable lessons but also helps us grow and develop as individuals. The spider-story of Robert Bruce and the journey of Thomas Edison towards the invention of the light bulb emphasize that failure has the potential to pave the way towards success. In approaching failure, there are several strategies that one can adopt: 1. Analyze the failure: To learn from failure, it is essential to recognize the root cause behind it. Consider the factors that led to the failure, such as the conditions and circumstances, personal performance, and potential areas of improvement. Reflecting on these elements can help in identifying what may be changed or adapted for better outcomes in the future. 2. Reevaluate your goals: Failure can sometimes be an indicator that the goal being pursued may not be the right fit. It's crucial to reconsider personal goals periodically, to ensure that they align with one's values, interests, and passions. Contemplate where achieving the goal will lead and whether it will bring fulfillment and satisfaction. Revisiting the intended outcome can help in determining if the pursuit is worth the risk of failure and if it ultimately aligns with personal growth and development. 3. Accept failure as a part of life: Failure is a natural part of the process, and learning to accept it can build resilience and perseverance. Embracing the ups and downs that come along the way can alleviate the negative emotions that are often associated with failure. Out of the options provided (A) learn to forget it, (B) learn to remember it, (C) learn to enjoy it, and (D) learn to accept it, the most appropriate approach to dealing with failure is (D) learning to accept it. Acceptance doesn't mean forgetting or being complacent; instead, it involves acknowledging the disappointment, understanding the lessons learned, and moving forward with a growth mindset. In summary, failure can serve as a stepping stone towards success if approached constructively. Analyzing the reasons behind the failure, reevaluating personal goals, and accepting failure as a part of life can help in fostering personal growth, ultimately enabling individuals to reach their full potential."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Try to differentiate between controllable and uncontrollable things. Feeling as though you have no control over your life is stressful, so try to acknowledge what you cannot change and focus on what you can change instead. Doing so should help you feel more in control and make it easier to cope with your stress. Try asking yourself a few of these questions: Is this situation avoidable? Which parts of this situation can I control? Is there a part of the situation that I need to accept for now because I cannot control it? What is my plan for controlling the aspects of the situation that I can control? Try to look at the big picture and ask yourself if this situation will matter in a year or five years? Will this one situation determine other things in your life? How important is controlling this one situation? Keep your eyes open to how you react and to how you express your feelings and emotions. Your feelings and emotions need a safe passage. We all have emotional moments, especially when we encounter stressful events, but it is important to realize that not dealing with these emotions add more stress. Try journaling about how stress is affecting your emotions. Journaling has many health benefits including promoting mental well-being, improving self-esteem, and decreasing stress. Write about what you have been bottling up throughout the day and use your journal as a way to release that emotional tension. Talk to someone you trust who will listen to you and be supportive. Social support is important because it can help you feel loved and cared for, which helps relieve stress. Being obsessed with perfection may lead to a mental breakdown. Are you being too tough on yourself or pushing yourself harder than you can manage? Some people are too hard on themselves because they feel like they need to be perfect. Try to practice self-compassion and allow yourself to be enough and to have done enough in one day, even if you don’t accomplish everything on your to-do list. Keep in mind that no matter what you do or how you do it, there is always room for improvement. Our over-commitments, our tendency to avoid offending others by never saying \\"no\\" can push us towards a mental breakdown. Saying ‘yes’ without realizing our limits or without setting boundaries can wreak havoc in our lives. It can also ruin our productivity by making it harder to focus on our primary tasks, activities, and responsibilities. Learning how to say \\"no\\" is the first step towards saving yourself, your productivity and your sanity. Remember, saying no is not selfish. It just means that you care enough about your well-being to maintain a healthy boundary for yourself. Saying no also means that you care about others and want to ensure that you will have the energy and mental capacity for your other obligations. Keep your answers direct and simple. You do not have to offer excuses, but a simple, “No – I’m sorry, I have too many commitments this week. I’ll have to take a rain check,” will do. Pursue an old hobby or find a new one. Hobbies can be anything like painting, gardening, volunteering, music, dancing. Hobbies take your mind off the stress of everyday life and focus your attention away from stress-causing activities, tasks, events, even if only for a brief period. These brief periods sustain you and bolster your spirits. Participation in hobbies and leisure activates reduces stress by giving you a break from everyday stress, by offering a means of relaxation, and by acting as a buffer or a protection against the effects of stress. Watch your favorite comedy shows and movies. Attend concerts. Laughing is even better if you are in the company of your loved ones. Laughing has huge stress relieving properties because it releases endorphins into the brain. These endorphins relax the body and these effects can last for up to 45 minutes after one laugh! Laughter strengthens your immune system and can also reduce pain, both of which are very important to relieve stress. Laughing has also been shown to boost mood and reduce anxiety. Make sure you count your blessings, be it your wonderful family, supportive friends, the job you love, the difference you make to others lives etc. Research has shown that gratitude increases self-esteem, reduces stress by increasing mental resilience, and promotes feelings of happiness. Reminding yourself from time to time what you are thankful for can reduce stress and prevent further stress buildup. Try keeping a gratitude journal to remind yourself of the things you are grateful for every day. Mental exercises such as meditation help you release the stress in your body. They also improve self-confidence and feelings of self-worth. Meditation allows your brain to take a breaks from the mental processes of the day, which decreases stress, improves creativity, and can help you regain your focus. Try taking a group class that teaches the basics of meditation or find free resources online such as guided meditation recordings. There are also some meditation apps that offer guided meditations with specific topics and lengths of time. Make an appointment to see a psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist. These professionals are trained to help people who feel they are headed for a mental breakdown. They can give you the tools to feel better before you get too overwhelmed. A type of therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy can be used to help stop negative thought patterns and help you feel more in control. In certain cases, medication may help. Talk to a psychiatrist about whether taking an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication could be called for in your situation.

Derrick passed away at the young age of 54, marking the end of an extraordinary career that was peppered with numerous accomplishments and milestones. Through this article, we pay homage to the iconic John Derrick by exploring his fascinating journey from a humble player to an inspiring coach. Early Life and Playing Career Born on September 13, 1963, in Pontypridd, Wales, John Derrick began his cricketing journey at a young age. His natural talent and deep-rooted passion for the sport led him to join Glamorgan's junior ranks, where he showcased his skills as a right-arm seamer and hard-hitting lower-order batsman. Derrick made his first-class debut for Glamorgan in 1983 and enjoyed a remarkable playing career that spanned over a decade. Throughout his time as a player, Derrick contributed 3,489 runs at an average of 15.46 and took 458 wickets at an impressive average of 35.26. Known for his signature outswingers, he became a reliable force in Glamorgan's bowling attack. Derrick was also a fantastic fielder, making him an invaluable all-round team member. Coaching Career Upon retiring from professional cricket in 1995, John Derrick transitioned into a coaching role, initially working as an assistant to the Glamorgan second XI. His dedication and strong work ethic didn't go unnoticed. In 2002, Derrick was appointed head coach of Glamorgan, succeeding Duncan Fletcher. Under Derrick's leadership, the Welsh county side flourished. In 2004, Glamorgan secured the National League Trophy as well as reached the final of the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy and the semi-finals of the Twenty20 Cup. Derrick's players greatly appreciated his commitment and innovative coaching style that focused on nurturing their individual skills and potential. Notable Achievements and Contributions Beyond his statistical accomplishments as a player and coach, John Derrick's career was marked by a fierce devotion to cricket, both within Glamorgan and across the world. He contributed immensely to the growth and development of the sport within Wales, often lending his expertise and guidance to the local cricket community. In addition to his work with Glamorgan, Derrick was also actively involved with the Cricket Board of Wales, where he played a pivotal role in shaping the country's cricketing landscape. His tireless efforts in nurturing the grass-root level and identifying promising talents will leave a lasting legacy on Welsh cricket for years to come. Final Thoughts John Derrick's untimely death is undoubtedly a significant loss for the cricket world and the Welsh sporting community. His inactmentalable passion, dedication, and contributions to the sport have had a profound impact on countless lives. Derrick's time as both an accomplished player and revered coach for Glamorgan should be celebrated and cherished in the cricketing world. In the words of Glamorgan chief executive, Hugh Morris, John Derrick was \\"a true Glamorgan legend\\"; his memory will undoubtedly continue to inspire and motivate future generations of cricketers. As we pay our final respects to this acclaimed figure, let us pause and acknowledge the indelible mark he has left on the world of cricket, both within and beyond the boundaries of Wales."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Two ways to store fish for future use are canning and freezing. Two other methods are drying and smoking. Today we have the first of the two reports describing, step by step, how to prepare dried fish. Begin with the fish that are just out of water. If the fish are small, leave their heads on. Cut off the heads if the fish are longer than twenty centimeters or weigh more than one hundred fifteen grams. Now clean the freshly caught fish. Cut off the scales and cut open the stomach. Remove everything inside. Then wash the fish in clean water and rub salt into them. Next, put the fish in a container with a solution of three hundred grams of salt and one liter of water. This will remove the blood from the meat. Keep the fish in the salt water for about thirty minutes. After that, wash them again in clean water. Next, put the fish in a solution that has more salt in the water. The water should be salty enough so that the fish float to the top. If the fish sink to the bottom of the container, add more salt to the water. Cover the container with a clean piece of wood. Place a heavy stone on the wood to hold it down. Leave the fish there for about six hours. After that remove them from the salt water and place them on a clean surface. Cover the fish with a clean piece of white cloth and let them dry. Another method of preparing fish is called dry salting. Wooden boxes or baskets are used for drying salting. After cleaning the fish, put a few of them on the bottom of the box or basket. Cover them with salt, then put more fish on top. Cover them also with salt. Continuing putting fish and salt in the container until it is full. Do not use too much salt when using the dry salting method. You should use one part salt to three parts fish. For example, if you have three kilograms of fish, you should use one kilogram of salt. Remove the fish after a week or ten days. Wash them in a mixture of water or a small amount of salt and let them dry. We have talked a lot about...

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine. <sep>What occurred simultaneously in 900AD?<sep>Portuguese taking over the land Output:","completion":"No"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 3: Evaluate the effect of increased heat on greenhouse gases As we know, greenhouse gases are already preventing heat from escaping into space. If there is more heat coming from the sun, it will add to the heat that these greenhouse gases have to trap, making the atmosphere even warmer. Step 4: Determine the effect of increased heat on the polar ice caps The increased temperature of the Earth due to additional heat would cause the polar ice caps to melt at a faster rate, accelerating the overall rise in temperature.
