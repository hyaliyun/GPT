Former Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School. Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the 48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive. He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko asks him for outside tutoring. When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts fighter. While watching the UFC at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives 10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA. Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only 750 to the loser. Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his 48,000 goal.

Here is a question about this article: Darwin's barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands.

Article: An increase in the number of suicides in prefix = st1 /South Korea, has led policeman Yoo Byoung-jong to a new job. He patrols Seoul's bridges to stop desperate people from throwing themselves into the river. According to South Korea's health ministry, suicide rates have doubled in a decade and are now the leading cause of death for people in their 20s and 30s. The country has the fourth-highest suicide rate among the 30 industrialized countries in the Organization for Co-operation and Development (OECD). It recorded 22.8 suicide deaths for every 100,000 people in 2003. That's lower than Hungry, Finlandand close neighbourJapan. But the number is growing by about 1 percent each year, faster than for all other OECD nations. In a move to cut suicides by a fifth by 2010, the health ministry is running a television ad campaign. It opens with a lonely man walking on a bridge. A voice over says: \\"Think five minutes more before you give it all away. Don't forget you have a loving family.\\" Other ministry plans include setting up more hotlines and training more suicide counselors. Authorities are also limiting websites that provide suicide methods and sometimes even sell toxic chemicals. Distressed individuals range from students worried about poor grades to people in debt as well as disgraced politicians. Experts say the rising toll in some way can be blamed on media coverage of recent high-profile suicides. These include top business leaders and celebrities who apparently lead a number of people to copy their actions. \\"We saved 50 lives this year when people turned to bridges as a place to die after news reports of such deaths by 'big shots',\\" said the 38-year-oldYoo, in December. Last July, the government and civil associations urged media to avoid reporting specific methods and locations of suicides. But it is difficult to clearly give reasons for the suicide increase.

Towering above the village is the estate of Elias Graves, a wealthy man who hopes to use his influence to remove these squatters from his land. When his lawyer is unable to so directly, he instead enacts a ban on net fishing, removing the livelihoods of many people in the village, including Tess and her father. Despite the ban, some continue to fish illegally, though they are soon confronted by men sent by Graves. In this confrontation, one of Graves' men is shot and killed. Tess' father is wrongfully accused of the murder and arrested. Meanwhile, through these altercations Tess meets Frederick Graves, Elias' son, who is home on a break from his theological studies. Before long, the two begin a forbidden romance. Also on break with Frederick is Dan Jordan, a friend from his fraternity, who simultaneously falls in love with Frederick's sister, Teola. Soon after Dan and Frederick return to college, Teola learns that she is pregnant and struggles to decide if she should tell Dan.

Please answer the following question: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect. Which friend studied less about short wavelength solar energy? A:","completion":"Vick studied less about short wavelength solar energy. While both Vick and Frank were studying the Earth's atmosphere, their areas of focus were different. Vick was focused on studying the troposphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere where weather changes occur and where planes cruise. Its study involves weather systems, cloud formations, air pressure and temperature gradients. On the other hand, Frank chose to study about the Greenhouse Effect. Understanding the Greenhouse Effect involves looking at how sunlight in the form of short-wave solar energy reaches the Earth's surface, getting through the layer of greenhouse gases without being absorbed due to its short wavelengths. Then, studying how some of the longer wavelengths, or far-infrared radiation, from the Earth's heat gets absorbed by these greenhouse gases and is reradiated back towards the Earth, which contributes to the global warming phenomenon represents another important layer of the Greenhouse Effect. Therefore, it can be concluded that Frank studied more about short wavelength solar energy than Vick because understanding this energy's behavior is fundamental to comprehending the Greenhouse Effect, while studying the troposphere doesn't inherently require knowledge of the behavior of short wavelength solar energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While it may be possible that the Asian man is riding his bike home after work, this hypothesis is not definitively supported by the given premise. The man could be riding for leisure purposes or running errands in the city, among other reasons. The brightly lit city can contribute a picturesque atmosphere, or it may point to the time of day, but again, we cannot make a sure conclusion based on the premise alone. To accurately conclude the hypothesis, we would need additional information or context. For instance, if the premise mentioned the time of day (e.g., \\"An Asian male rides a bike in the streets of a large brightly lit city during rush hour after work\\"), then the hypothesis would be more likely to be true.

Zinni feared that Bin Laden would in the future locate himself in cities, where U.S. missiles could kill thousands of Afghans. He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

One day the Prince wanted to go hunt-ing with his men. He told his dog to stay at home and look after his baby son. The baby was in a wooden cradle, which was like a small bed. When the Prince came back from hunt-ing, Gelert ran out to meet his master. He wagged his tail and jumped up to put his paws on the Prince's chest. Then the Prince saw the blood on Gelert's jaws and head. \\"What have you done?\\" the Prince said. He rushed into his house and looked for his baby son.

Court gives banks 'beat-down' over foreclosures NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The Massachusetts high court ruled on Friday that two foreclosures are invalid because the banks could not prove they had the proper paperwork to foreclose. The banks \\"failed to make the required showing that they were the holders of the mortgages at the time of foreclosure,\\" Justice Ralph Gants wrote for the Massachusetts Supreme Court. This could be a harbinger of things to come because it is the first ruling by a state high court on the issue of whether banks can foreclose on homeowners if can't prove they hold the mortgages. Numerous instances of this emerged last fall, as evidence appeared that banks were robo-signing foreclosure documents without actually reading them. As a result, there are dozens of similar cases in lower courts across the country, all waiting for the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling. \\"It's about the most extensive beat-down the banks have received over their shoddy practices,\\" said Christopher Peterson, a real estate law professor at the University of Utah. \\"It could be a wake-up call for rubberstamping judges that they need to more carefully examine practices.\\" What's the issue? Mortgage loans are like real property and can only be transferred by physically signing over the paperwork -- like someone endorsing a check or the title to a car -- and delivering it to the next holder. Without that, the holder of record doesn't change. Under mortgage securitization, loans get transferred many times after origination before landing in pools of mortgages that are sold to investors. But often times, the banks simply didn't endorse the paperwork between steps. Massachusetts law on how to legally transfer mortgages goes back more than 200 years and is very clear, according to Paul Collier, the attorney who represented homeowner Antonio Ibanez in the case. \\"You've never been able to assign in blank in Massachusetts,\\" he said. The high court agreed with that assessment, but also clarified that when banks transfer mortgages into a pool they can establish ownership through proper recording or through a document that states all of the mortgages held in the pool, with addresses and owner names. Although, Justice Grants said, \\"recording is likely the better practice.\\" \\"The key in either case is that the foreclosing entity must hold the mortgage at the time of the notice and sale in order accurately to identify itself as the present holder in the notice and in order to have the authority to foreclose under the power of sale,\\" he added. What happened? Regardless of recording issues, there is little dispute that Antonio Ibanez, a special education teacher in Springfield, Mass., defaulted on his loan for 103,500. He did not even fight the foreclosure when it came in 2007. The case only went to trial because the bank needed to establish clear title to the property after foreclosure so it could resell the house. The insurance companies would not issue title insurance on the home without a court ruling. The case went before state Land Court Judge Keith Long, who found no evidence that the plaintiffs were the actual mortgage holders and asked them to prove it. According to court papers, Ibanez's loan went through five different owners before winding up in a pool of mortgages that U.S. Bank was the trustee for. During that trip down the chain, the parties failed to legally assign the mortgage. The bank produced documents that showed that the loan was one of the mortgages put into a pool, but that failed to satisfy the court, which cited \\"the utter carelessness with which the plaintiff banks documented the titles to their assets.\\" In the case of Mark and Tammy LaRaces, Wells Fargo, provided evidence that the loan had been assigned to a pool. The evidence, however, was merely a copy of the pooling and servicing agreement that had been downloaded from the SEC website and was unsigned. The state's high court ruled that, in both the Ibanez and the LaRace cases, no valid assignments were made after the lender assigned it to the record holder, Option One Mortgage Corp. in both cases. Option One, therefore, was the mortgage holder at the time of the foreclosures and no one else had the right to foreclose. The future: Bruce Allensworth, an attorney for the banks, said they have the records to prove ownership in both cases, but since they were not introduced in Land Court hearing, rules of evidence prevented them from being introduced into the appeal. \\"I'm thinking if there's a way of going back and reintroducing these documents to the Land Court,\\" he said. So where does that leave Ibanez and the LaRaces? According to Collier, his clients may now own the home free and clear. \\"I don't see how [the banks] can win if they challenge the decision,\\" he said, \\"but maybe they'll take a shot.\\" ||||| The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court today upheld a contentious land court ruling that puts in question the ownership of hundreds, possibly thousands, of foreclosed properties in the state. The ruling challenges the way lenders have traditionally foreclosed on properties -- without having all the paperwork in place at the time a home is seized. It affirms a 2009 lower court decision that invalidated foreclosures on two Springfield homes because the lenders did not hold clear titles to the properties. Cambridge attorney Paul Collier, who represented one of the homeowners in the case, said the supreme court ruling invalidates thousands of foreclosures, reverting ownership back to the homeowners who lost the homes, at least temporarily. In most cases, those property takings will have to be redone, further clogging an already bogged down foreclosure process that many real estate specialists say has contributed to the stagnant housing market. \\"The banks and the investors are going to have to deal with those homeowners as to what happens to those properties,\\" Collier said. During the housing boom, millions of mortgages were packaged into bonds and sold to investors, a process that resulted in lengthy and tangled paper trails that can obscure ownership. Many lenders believed they could complete foreclosure transactions and later produce formal proof they held a mortgage. Today's ruling makes it clear that the practice will not be allowed in Massachusetts. \\"We agree with the [land court] judge that the plaintiffs who were not the original mortgagees, failed to make the required showing that they were the holders of the mortgages at the time of foreclosure,'' the justices said in their opinion. The decision will also have national implications at a time when lenders' foreclosure practices are being scrutinized by federal regulators and state attorneys general. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The Massachusetts high court ruled that two foreclosures are invalid due to the banks' inability to present proper paperwork proving their authority to foreclose.

Mortgage loans are transferred multiple times after origination before landing in pools of mortgages that are sold to investors. Banks often fail to endorse the necessary paperwork between these transfers, which the Massachusetts high court has identified as a requirement for a valid foreclosure. This ruling could mean that thousands of foreclosures are invalidated, reverting ownership back to the homeowners, at least temporarily. The banks and investors will now have to work with these homeowners to determine the future of the affected properties.

How to do a pilates push up Align your body in the modified pilates stance by lifting your arms above your head, extending them as far upwards as possible. Keep your body posture tall and straight. Push your shoulder blades downwards and keep them away from your ears.","completion":"In the next steps of performing a Pilates push-up, you will proceed as follows: 1. Engage your core: Before initiating the push-up movement, engage your abdominal muscles to maintain a strong core. This will provide support to your lower back and help in maintaining a neutral spine during the exercise. Take a deep breath in, then exhale while drawing your navel towards your spine. 2. Move into the plank position: With your arms fully extended above your head, hinge forward from your hips, keeping your back flat and legs straight. As you hinge forward, lower your arms and place your palms flat on the ground shoulder-width apart. Ensure that your wrists are in line with your shoulders. Walk your feet back until you reach a full plank position, with your body forming a straight line from your head to your heels. Your legs should be hip-width apart and your gaze should be slightly ahead of your hands. Take a moment to ensure your core is still engaged and your body is in proper alignment. 3. Lower your body: Begin to lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, ensuring they are pointing towards your ribcage and not flaring out to the sides. While doing this, maintain a steady breath, inhaling as you lower yourself down. Keep your body straight and avoid letting your hips sag. 4. Push up: Once your chest is close to the ground, pause momentarily. Exhale as you push your body back up into the plank position by straightening your arms. Make sure you keep your core engaged and maintain a straight body line. 5. Return to the starting position: From the plank position, walk your feet towards your hands, then slowly lift your upper body back up, hinging from your hips. Extend your arms above your head, returning to the initial standing position with your body aligned in the modified Pilates stance. 6. Repeat the push-up sequence: Aim to complete 8-12 Pilates push-ups, ensuring you are maintaining proper form and breathing throughout the exercise. Take a break if needed, but try to keep proper form with each repetition. 7. Add variations (optional): To increase the challenge of the Pilates push-up, you can add variations, such as performing the exercise with your legs lifted one at a time or by placing your hands on an unstable surface, like a BOSU ball or an exercise ball. Incorporating Pilates push-ups into your exercise routine can help improve your upper body strength, core stability, and overall body control. As with any exercise, it's essential to maintain proper form, alignment, and breathing to maximize the benefits and reduce any risk of injury. Remember to stretch and warm up before beginning your workout, and to seek guidance from a certified Pilates instructor if you're unsure of your form or technique."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She is 5. She also has the playset from the fairytopia line. What a waste of money. The wings always fall off and the way they clip on makes it impossible to put other clothes on the doll. The other day she took off the clothes and put them on another barbie. Don't waste your 17.99. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review provided can be described as depicting the product in an unflattering light. Several reasons support this interpretation, which are detailed below. 1. Disappointment from expectations: The reviewer begins by mentioning that the product was a Christmas present for their 5-year-old daughter. The context of a special occasion delivery followed by dissatisfaction implies that the product did not live up to the expectations tied to such an event. 2. Comparison to another product: The reviewer states that their daughter also owns a playset from the Fairytopia line. By mentioning this, it is possible that the reviewer wants to emphasize that they do have experience with this type of product, and therefore, their opinion should be considered reliable. 3. Issues with functionality: The primary complaint of the reviewer is that the product's wings fall off easily, leading to a subpar experience for their daughter. Additionally, they mention that the way the wings attach to the doll makes it difficult to change its clothes. These negative aspects highlight that the product has design flaws affecting its usability and play value, which reflects unfavorably on the product. 4. Preference for other products: The reviewer shares that their daughter went on to dress another Barbie doll with the product's clothes. This detail might suggest that the intended play experience with the product's clothes is more enjoyable when used with other dolls, further casts a negative light on the original product. 5. Price concern: The reviewer concludes by advising potential buyers not to waste their 17.99 on the product. This statement implies that the reviewer believes the product is overpriced given its quality and the issues with its design, adding to the overall negative perception. In summary, the review portrays the product in an unflattering light due to the various issues mentioned, such as design flaws and disappointment from expectations. The comparison to another product line and a clear warning not to waste money on the product further strengthens the negative portrayal of the product."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which entity is this text about? Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, KCN (born 21 September 1963) is a former cricketer from Antigua who played 98 Test matches for the West Indies. A fast bowler, he took 405 Test wickets at an average of 20.99 and topped the ICC Player Rankings for much of his career to be rated the best bowler in the world. His great height--he is 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall--allowed him to make the ball bounce unusually high after he delivered it; allied to his pace and accuracy, it made him a difficult bowler for batsmen to face. A man of few words during his career, he was notoriously reluctant to speak to journalists. The West Indies toured Australia in 1992-93, recovering from losing the second Test to win the final two matches and take the series 2-1. The team also won the annual World Series Cup. In the first three Tests, Ambrose was hampered by pitches which did not suit his bowling and, according to Tony Cozier writing in Wisden, was often unlucky when he bowled, although he took five for 66 in the first Test. In the final two Tests, he took 19 wickets. In the fourth he took ten wickets, including six for 74 in the first innings; in the second innings, he took three wickets in 19 deliveries and the West Indies won the match by one run. According to Cozier, the captains of both teams, Richie Richardson and Allan Border, \\"paid tribute to the man who made the result possible: Ambrose consolidated his reputation as the world's leading bowler\\". On the first day of the decisive final Test, Ambrose took seven wickets at the cost of one run from 32 deliveries and finished with figures of seven for 25. Cozier described it as \\"one of Test cricket's most devastating spells\\". West Indies won by an innings and Ambrose was named man of the series, having taken 33 wickets to equal the record in an Australia-West Indies Test series. He topped the West Indian bowling averages with an average of 16.42. Cozier described Ambrose's performance as \\"instrumental in winning [the series]\\" and his bowling as \\"flawless\\". In the one-day tournament, Ambrose took 18 wickets at 13.38. He took eight wickets in the two-match final--both games were won by the West Indies. In the first final, he took five for 32, driven to bowl with more hostility when the Australian batsman Dean Jones asked him to remove his white wristbands while bowling. He followed up with three for 26 in the second match to be named player of the finals. After a one-day tournament in South Africa, West Indies returned home for Test and ODI series against Pakistan. The ODI series was drawn, but the West Indies defeated Pakistan 2-0 in the Tests. Ambrose took nine wickets at 23.11 to be fifth in the team bowling averages. The Wisden report suggested that he was suffering from fatigue after his team's busy schedule, but although not at his best, he continued to take important wickets. For Northamptonshire in 1993, Ambrose was second in the team first-class bowling averages with 59 wickets at 20.45. Having developed a slower ball, and using the yorker more sparingly, Ambrose took five wickets in three games as West Indies won an ODI tournament in Sharjah in late October and November 1993. The team competed in another tournament, this time in India, later that November. They finished as runners-up, and Ambrose took four wickets in five matches. Immediately following this, West Indies toured Sri Lanka to play three ODIs and a Test, a rain-ruined match in which Ambrose took three wickets.","completion":"This text is about Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, a former cricketer from Antigua who played for the West Indies.

On its own, the word \\"thud\\" does not carry any inherent sentiment – positive or negative. It is an onomatopoeic expression representing a heavy, dull sound produced when an object strikes or falls onto another surface. To determine the sentiment behind this sentence, one must take into account the surrounding context and the intentions of the speaker or writer. Here are a few examples of how \\"thud\\" could be used in different contexts with varying sentiments: 1. In a suspenseful or frightening context: Imagine a scene in a thriller movie where a character is walking through a dark, eerie forest, and suddenly hears a \\"thud\\" in the background. In this case, the sentiment associated with \\"thud\\" would be negative, as it can evoke feelings of fear, anxiety, or tension for the character and the audience. 2. In a humorous or light-hearted context: If \\"thud\\" is used in a funny scenario, such as someone accidentally dropping a watermelon, which makes a loud \\"thud\\" sound on the ground, the sentiment would be more light-hearted and amusing. In this context, the \\"thud\\" may evoke laughter or amusement rather than any negative emotions. 3. In a neutral, descriptive context: If \\"thud\\" is used alone to describe the sound made by an object falling or striking another surface, without any additional context, it can be seen as a straightforward, neutral description of auditory imagery. In this case, there is no specific sentiment associated with the sentence – it is merely providing information about the sound. 4. In a positive or victorious context: In situations where \\"thud\\" is used to symbolize or emphasize a triumph or success, the sentiment can be positive. For example, during a weightlifting competition, a contestant successfully lifts the weights, and the \\"thud\\" sound made as they drop the weights onto the platform may signal victory and accomplishment. Here, the \\"thud\\" could elicit feelings of satisfaction, pride, or enthusiasm. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"thud\\" can be perceived in multiple ways, depending on the context in which it is used. To accurately gauge the sentiment behind it, one must consider not only the word itself but also the surrounding text, dialogue, or scenario in which it appears. Without specific context or additional information, it's challenging to determine the precise sentiment of the word \\"thud.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Snapchat agrees to settle FTC charges that it deceived users Messaging app Snapchat promised users that the photos and videos they send disappear forever seconds after they're opened. But security and privacy advocates have repeatedly reported that that's not always true. On Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission announced that the smartphone app maker has agreed to settle charges alleging that the company had deceived consumers with assurances about the \\"disappearing nature\\" of messages sent through the service and other data collection and security practices. The FTC complaint laid out several ways that photo \\"snaps\\" sent through the application could be saved without the users' knowledge. For example, some third-party apps could be used to capture messages sent through the service, the FTC said, and video messages remained accessible to recipients who connected their smartphone to a computer. The FTC also alleged that the app collected data from users without their consent or knowledge -- including geolocation information from those using the Android version of the app and contacts from the address books of those using the Apple iOS version. Additionally, the complaint alleged that Snapchat failed to properly secure it's \\"Find Friends\\" feature -- resulting in the widely reported security breach that allowed attackers to compile a database of 4.6 million Snapchat usernames and phone numbers. Snapchat later released an update that fixed the issue and let users to opt out of the feature. Under the terms of its settlement, Snapchat will not be fined. But the app maker will be prohibited from misrepresenting the privacy, security or confidentiality of user data within the app and be required to implement a comprehensive privacy program to be monitored by an independent party over the next 20 years. If Snapchat violates the settlement in the future, it could face financial penalties. Although the consent decree did not require Snapchat to admit fault, the app maker acknowledged in a statement to The Washington Post that it had made mistakes. \\"While we were focused on building, some things didn’t get the attention they could have,\\" Snapchat said in the statement, noting that it should have been \\"more precise\\" in how it communicated with users. But the company also insisted that it had resolved many of the issues in the complaint before the settlement was announced and that it is \\"devoted to promoting user privacy and giving Snapchatters control over how and with whom they communicate.\\" A recent update to Snapchat added new capabilities, including text messaging and video conferencing. The text messaging feature will allow recipients to save exchanges without notifying the sender -- a significant departure from the supposedly disappearing picture messages that drove the app's initial growth. Update: Julia Horwitz, Consumer Protection Counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center which originally complained to the FTC about Snapchat, told the Post it was happy with the resolution. \\"We're extremely pleased that the FTC is taking its data privacy protection seriously and is recognizing behaviors by companies like Snapchat that breach promises to consumers,\\" she said. \\"This was a real success.\\" \\"But this consent order's true effectiveness depends upon the agency's consistent enforcement over the next 20 years,\\" she cautioned.","completion":"Snapchat is an app that allows people to send pictures and messages to each other, and the main feature is that the pictures and messages are supposed to disappear after a short time.

Now, Snapchat has agreed to not lie about the privacy of their users' data and to have a special privacy plan that will be checked by an independent group for the next 20 years. They won't have to pay any fines, but if they break the rules in the future, they might have to pay money.

There has been a great deal of debate in the past few years in the United Kingdom about whether to discourage cousin marriages through government public relations campaigns or ban them entirely. The debate has been prompted by a Pakistani immigrant population making up 1.5% of the British population, of whom about 50-70% marry a first cousin. In the 1980s researchers found that children to closely related Pakistani parents had an autosomal recessive condition rate of 4% compared to 0.1% for the European group. For example, Environment Minister (later Immigration Minister) Phil Woolas said in 2008, \`\`If you have a child with your cousin the likelihood is there'll be a genetic problem'' and that such marriages were the \`\`elephant in the room''. Physician Mohammad Walji has spoken out against the practice, saying that it is a \`\`very significant'' cause of infant death, and his practice has produced leaflets warning against it. However, Alan Bittles of the Centre for Comparative Genomics in Australia states that the risk of birth defects rises from roughly 2% in the general population to 4% for first cousins and therefore that \`\`It would be a mistake to ban it''. Aamra Darr of the University of Leeds has also criticized what she called an \`\`alarmist presentation of data'' that exaggerates the risk.

Process: - An organism dies - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden - The minerals form a fossil. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose having fewer remains happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation you proposed, having fewer remains, would directly affect the formation of LESS fossils. Let's analyze the entire process to provide a more comprehensive understanding: 1. An organism dies: The fossilization process begins with the death of an organism. Fewer remains imply the reduced availability of organic material for fossilization to occur. 2. Water seeps into the remains: As water penetrates the dead organism's remains, it begins the process of mineralization. With fewer remains available, there is less opportunity for this step to take place. 3. Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals: The minerals in the water create crystals, which aid in preserving the organism's remains. However, if there are fewer remains, fewer opportunities exist for crystal formation. 4. Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden: Hardening of the remains is an essential step in fossil formation, ensuring their preservation. Fewer remains result in a decrease in this hardening process and thus lesser fossils. 5. The minerals form a fossil: As the crystalized minerals continue to form and replace the original organic material, a fossil is created. With fewer remains available for this process, there will be a reduction in overall fossil formation. In summary, the proposed perturbation of having fewer remains directly impacts the fossilization process, leading to a decrease in the formation of fossils. Less dead organic material means fewer opportunities for each stage of the fossilization process to occur, ultimately resulting in fewer fossils being formed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again.

Here's my step-by-step reasoning: 1. First, I need to understand the key elements of the conversation. The conversation consists of one short question from a character named F: \\"F: Are you going to work long?\\" 2. Secondly, I will try to understand the context or the background of the conversation. Since there is limited context, I'll interpret the question as a general inquiry about the listener's working hours or duration for that particular day or time frame. 3. Next, I will consider possible responses that the listener can say. The answer can naturally fall into one of two categories: affirmative (yes, they plan to work long) or negative (no, they do not plan to work long). The listener might also provide additional information depending on their relationship with F, the context, or personal preference. 4. Then, I will decide on a potential response for the listener based on the categories outlined above. Considering these factors, an apt response for the listener might be: A: No, I don't plan to work too long today. I should be finished in a couple of hours.

Thomson was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the youngest of six children. He arrived in the United States two years later. His father, a cabinet maker, had moved to New York City shortly before Bobby's birth and sent for his family in 1925. Thomson grew up on Staten Island in New York City and signed with the New York Giants for a 100 bonus right out of Curtis High School in 1942. Thomson became a celebrity for his walk-off home run off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca to win the 1951 National League pennant. The home run, nicknamed the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\", was dramatic as, until 1969, league pennants were only decided by playoff when the teams involved finished the regular season in a tie. Prior to 1951 playoffs had only been necessary in 1946 (NL) and 1948 (AL). Although in mid-August the Giants were 13 1/2 games behind the league-leading Dodgers, they won 37 of their final 44 games to tie Brooklyn on the final day of the regular season, forcing a three-game playoff. The Giants won the first game 3-1 as a result of a two-run home run by Thomson (off Branca). Brooklyn's Clem Labine shut out the Giants in the second game, 10-0. The decisive contest, played on October 3 at the Polo Grounds, was the first major sporting event televised coast-to-coast in the United States. The Dodgers took a 4-1 lead into the bottom of the ninth inning; but Giants shortstop Alvin Dark singled, advanced to third on a single by Don Mueller, and scored on a double by Whitey Lockman. With Lockman on second and pinch-runner Clint Hartung at third, Thomson's walk-off home run turned looming defeat into a 5-4 victory. The moment was immortalized by Giants play-by-play announcer Russ Hodges's excited multiple repetitions: \\"The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!\\" Waiting in the on-deck circle to hit behind Thomson was rookie Willie Mays. The Giants' season ended, however, at the 1951 World Series; the Yankees swept the last three games to win the best-of-seven series, 4 games to 2. Thomson batted .238 in the Series with no home runs. The bat from the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" is in the collection of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. The uniform worn by Thomson on that day is apparently a part of a large private collection owned by Dan Scheinman, a member of the San Francisco Giants ownership group. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was the \\"Shot heard round the world\\"?","completion":"The \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" was a very special and famous home run in baseball history. It was hit by Bobby Thomson during a game in 1951. This home run was important because it helped his team, the New York Giants, win the National League pennant.

It's great to hear from you again! First off, Lynn, I hope your recovery goes smoothly and that you feel better soon. The fact that you are communicating with your friends shows how determined you are to overcome your current challenges. It's nice to know that you have supportive people in your life who care about your well-being. Now, about the grueling ride that was mentioned – there could be several factors contributing to the intensity and difficulty of the ride. Here are some possible reasons as to why it was deemed grueling: 1. Challenging terrain: The route chosen for the ride might have included steep inclines, rough surfaces, or technical sections that push riders to their physical and mental limits. Navigating through such tricky terrain requires not only stamina and strength but also advanced riding skills and focus. 2. Weather conditions: Riding under extreme weather conditions, such as scorching heat, torrential rain, or strong winds, can add an extra element of difficulty to the ride. Such conditions require riders to combat fatigue, dehydration, and slippery surfaces, to name a few challenges. 3. Long distance: If the ride covered a long distance or lasted for an extended period, it could lead to increased exhaustion levels and muscle weariness. Longer distances require riders to be both physically and mentally prepared while also ensuring they have enough energy and supplies to complete the journey. 4. High elevation: The ride might have taken place at higher altitudes where the air is thinner, causing a decrease in oxygen levels. This can lead to accelerated fatigue and exhaustion, making the ride much more challenging than usual. 5. Unfamiliar routes: If the riders took a new path they were not familiar with, they might have faced unexpected obstacles or challenges that would make the ride grueling. Being prepared for the unknown is a skill developed with experience. 6. Personal fitness levels: The riders' individual fitness levels play a crucial role in determining how grueling the ride feels. While more experienced riders might have had an easier time, those who are less fit or new to riding might find the same route much more demanding. Challenging oneself and consistently pushing limits is a vital part of developing better endurance and skills. It sounds like you have another exciting adventure planned with the Sheep Mountain Ride tomorrow at the Rattlesnake. Remember to prepare well, stay hydrated, and ensure your bikes and equipment are in good working condition.

A broker can help you create a diverse and profitable investment portfolio in line with your financial goals and risk tolerance. But it's essential to know what to expect when working with a professional broker, from account types and fees to investment strategies and tax implications. In this article, we'll break down eight key expectations to consider when engaging a professional broker to manage your investments. 1. Expect to pay a fee for every transaction you make Professional brokers make their income through commissions and fees. Every time a trade or transaction is executed on your behalf, you should anticipate a fee associated with that transaction. These fees can be based on a percentage of the transaction amount or a flat fee per trade. Always make sure you understand the fee structure upfront to avoid any surprises later on. 2. Expect your broker to ask your acceptable level of risk Before a broker can create a personalized investment strategy for you, they will need to understand your risk tolerance. Your acceptable level of risk will help your broker determine the types of investments that best suit your needs and goals. Be prepared to answer questions about how long you're planning to invest, your financial goals, and your comfort level with potential losses. The more information you provide, the better-equipped your broker will be to create an investment plan tailored to your unique needs. 3. Expect most professional investors to choose margin accounts, not cash accounts There are two primary types of accounts that brokers offer: margin accounts and cash accounts. Margin accounts provide investors with the ability to borrow money from their brokerage firm to invest in additional securities and amplify gains and losses. Cash accounts, on the other hand, only allow investors to trade stocks and other assets limited to the cash available in their accounts. While cash accounts can be appealing for novice investors due to their simplicity, most professional investors opt for margin accounts because of the increased flexibility and purchasing power they provide. Margin accounts can lead to higher returns if used wisely but can also lead to more significant losses. Therefore, it's crucial to consider your risk tolerance, experience, and financial goals before choosing an account type. 4. Expect the broker to determine your tax status based on your financial needs A professional broker should be able to determine and inform you of your tax status as it relates to your investments. Tax implications play a significant role in your overall investment strategy, as different investment products and income streams are treated differently for tax purposes. Understanding the tax implications of your investments ensures you're compliant with tax laws provides crucial information for tax planning and maximizing your investment returns. 5. Expect the meeting to end with a request for your investment money Once your broker has gathered all the necessary information, including your risk tolerance, financial goals, and preferred account type, expect them to request your initial investment. Make sure you have the funds available and are comfortable with the amount you're investing. Keep in mind that investing always carries risks, so never invest more than you're prepared to lose. 6. Expect a professional broker often uses algorithm-based trading Many professional brokers leverage algorithm-based trading in their investment strategies. These algorithms can quickly analyze vast amounts of data, automate specific trades, and help brokers identify potential opportunities based on pre-set criteria. Algorithm-based trading can result in cost and time savings for investors while ensuring your investment strategy is consistently executed in line with your preferences. 7. Expect a professional to invest in things other than stocks While stocks are a popular type of investment, professional brokers will typically develop a diverse investment portfolio on your behalf. This might include other assets like bonds, mutual funds, real estate, commodities, and even alternative investments like cryptocurrencies. Diversifying your investment portfolio helps spread your risk across various asset classes, which reduces your exposure to potential market downturns and increases the chances of long-term success. 8. Expect a broker to invest in \\"funds,\\" or pre-made collections of stocks Along with individual stocks and assets, professional brokers often invest in funds or pre-made collections of stocks. These baskets of securities might include mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and index funds, which give investors exposure to a broad range of stocks while minimizing the risks associated with individual stock picking. Investing in funds can be a more accessible and cost-effective way for investors to diversify and gain exposure to various market segments. Conclusion Understanding what to expect when working with a professional broker is key to building a strong partnership and achieving your investment goals. From fees and account types to investment strategies and tax implications, familiarizing yourself with these eight expectations will ensure you're well-prepared for your journey into the world of professional investing. With the right broker and a proactive approach to managing your investments, you'll be well on your way to realizing your financial objectives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Carthage was Palermo’s major trading partner under the Phoenicians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period. Palermo came into contact with the Ancient Greeks between the 6th and the 5th centuries BC which preceded the Sicilian Wars, a conflict fought between the Greeks of Syracuse and the Phoenicians of Carthage for control over the island of Sicily. During this war the Greeks named the settlement Panormos (Πάνορμος) from which the current name is derived, meaning \\"all port\\" due to the shape of its coast. It was from Palermo that Hamilcar I's fleet (which was defeated at the Battle of Himera) was launched. In 409 B.C. the city was looted by Hermocrates of Syracuse. The Sicilian Wars ended in 265 BC when Carthage and Syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the Romans from gaining full control of the island during the First Punic War. In 276 BC, during the Pyrrhic War, Panormos briefly became a Greek colony after being conquered by Pyrrhus of Epirus, but returned to Phoenician Carthage in 275. In 254 BC Panormos was besieged and conquered by the Romans in the first battle of Panormus (the name Latin name). Carthage attempted to reconquer Panormus in 251 BC but failed.

Thunderstorms form over the ocean: More water vapor can lead to increased thunderstorm formation due to greater moisture available in the atmosphere. This is a direct impact on this step of the process. 2. An area of low pressure causes rotation: The additional water vapor could cause lower pressure areas to intensify, indirectly affecting this step by creating more favorable conditions for rotation. 3. Several thunderstorms come together around this area: With more thunderstorms forming, there is a higher likelihood of multiple thunderstorms converging around the low-pressure area, directly impacting this step of the process. 4. The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating: More water vapor increases the storm's fuel supply, as warm, moist air is essential for hurricane development. This directly impacts this step of the process. 5. When the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is considered a hurricane: The presence of additional water vapor can contribute to increased wind speeds, as more energy is available to the storm. This could indirectly impact this step of the process by making it more likely for a storm to reach hurricane status. Answer: The supposed perturbation due to collecting more water vapor is directly impacting a step of the process and indirectly impacting a step of the process. It directly impacts the formation of thunderstorms and the storm being fed by warm ocean water evaporating. It indirectly impacts wind speeds reaching hurricane status and possibly the intensification of low-pressure areas, leading to rotation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hummer pursued a broadcasting career briefly in 1996 and worked for TVG Network , a horse racing network . Hummer briefly pursued a broadcasting career in 1996 . He first worked for TVG Network , a horse racing network .","completion":"Although the two sentences convey similar information, they do not have the exact same meaning. Here is a detailed analysis of the differences between the sentences: 1. Sentence one highlights that Hummer pursued a broadcasting career briefly in 1996 and worked for the TVG Network, a horse racing network. The sentence structure and phrasing give the impression that Hummer's entire broadcasting career was short-lived and was solely focused on working for the TVG Network during 1996. 2. Sentence two states that Hummer briefly pursued a broadcasting career in 1996 and initially worked for the TVG Network, a horse racing network. This sentence implies that Hummer had a short stint in broadcasting during 1996, with the TVG Network being the first place where he worked. The emphasis on \\"He first worked\\" suggests that there may have been other positions or opportunities within the broadcasting industry after the TVG Network experience. The second sentence leaves the door open to further developments in Hummer's broadcasting career, whether short or long term. In summary, while both sentences point out that Hummer pursued a broadcasting career in 1996 and worked for the TVG Network, the first sentence indicates that his entire broadcasting career was short and limited to his work at the TVG Network. In contrast, the second sentence portrays the TVG Network as the starting point of Hummer's broadcasting pursuit but doesn't exclude the possibility of other broadcasting roles later on."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It delves into the disturbing and complex relationship they shared, as well as the subsequent trial that gripped the nation. Directed by Rob Lowe, the film stars Tania Raymonde as Arias and Jesse Lee Soffer as Alexander, both giving eerily accurate portrayals of the real-life figures they represent. The movie is praised not only for its acting, but also for its storytelling, which manages to present a more nuanced and layered picture of the events than many viewers were expecting. \\"It's not just a regurgitation of the sensational headlines,\\" said one film critic. \\"There's an attempt to understand the characters and the motivations behind their actions, which is more than can be said for many true crime adaptations.\\" While some might argue that it's still a sensationalized portrayal of a tragic and violent event, Dirty Little Secret has undoubtedly surpassed many expectations for a made-for-TV movie.

As the plot unfolds, H escalates his methods (with Brody as the \\"good cop\\"). Brody realizes that Yusuf anticipated that he would be tortured. Yusuf then makes his demands: he would like the President of the United States to announce a cessation of support for \\"puppet governments\\" and dictatorships in Muslim countries and a withdrawal of American troops from all Muslim countries.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What happened one universities were no longer the best place to get scientific information? Context: Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.

Jefferson Thomas, one of the so-called \\"Little Rock Nine,\\" the nine students who integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957, has died, according to Carlotta Walls LaNier, president of the group's foundation. He was 67. Thomas died of pancreatic cancer on Sunday, the Little Rock Nine Foundation said in a statement. He was living in Columbus, Ohio. As a 15-year-old, Thomas was one of the nine African-American students who braved segregationist mobs to integrate the all-white school under the protection of military forces. A retired federal accountant for the Department of Defense, Thomas \\"had spent the last decade of his life doing community service, traveling to promote racial harmony and supporting young people in seeking higher education,\\" the foundation said. In 1999, he and the others received a Congressional Gold Medal from President Bill Clinton. Thomas' oldest sister, Alma Hildreth, told CNN she believes God protected Thomas so that he could accomplish a mission that God had given him: \\"To stand up and do what he thought was right, [and to show] that education belonged to him and all the children.\\" \\"He did a lot of good that he really enjoyed doing and wanted to do. He did a lot of speaking and encouraging young people to reach for the stars. That was his mission, to do that,\\" Hildreth said. President Barack Obama expressed his condolences to Thomas' family in a statement issued Monday, and praised Thomas' bravery in entering Central High School. \\"Mr. Thomas was just a teenager when he became one of the first African-American students to enroll in Little Rock Central High School. Yet even at such a young age, he had the courage to risk his own safety, to defy a governor and a mob, and to walk proudly into that school even though it would have been far easier to give up and turn back,\\" the Obama statement said. Obama said the action \\"helped open the doors of opportunity for their generation and for those that followed.\\" The surviving members of the Little Rock Nine \\"expressed their heartfelt sadness at the passing of the man they called their brother in a unique group for the past 53 years,\\" the foundation's statement said. The nine have remained close, and through their foundation they provided college scholarships and mentoring to students. \\"I will miss his calculated sense of humor,\\" said LaNier, another member of the nine. \\"He had a way of asking a question and ending it with a joke, probably to ease the pain during our teenage years at Central. He was a Christian who sincerely promoted racial harmony and took his responsibilities seriously.\\" \\"Jefferson has always been, to us, a brother,\\" said Melba Pattillo Beals, another one of the nine. \\"He's funny and very strong, like when we would have a very difficult day, things were absolutely at their worst, he would say, 'Smile, you're on Candid Camera,' or, you know, 'Look at what you're wearing!' He was just really, really funny.\\" She said Thomas sent other members of the group funny e-mails almost until the day of his death. On September 4, 1957, a national furor erupted as the nine students attempted to enter Central High. Then-Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus, in defiance of a federal court order desegregating schools, called out the Arkansas National Guard to prevent them from entering. \\"The nine students, chosen by Little Rock school system administrators for their excellent grades and records of good behavior, were stunned by the presence of hundreds of rioting segregationists and the Arkansas National Guard, the foundation said. The group was turned away. For two weeks, the group remained at home, attempting to keep up with their schoolwork. The federal court ordered Faubus to stop interfering with the court order, so he removed the guardsmen from the front of the school. On September 23, the nine entered the school for the first time, but an angry crowd outside beat African-American reporters who were covering the events, according to the encyclopedia. Little Rock police, who feared they could not control the mob, pulled the nine from the school that day, and they returned home. President Dwight D. Eisenhower then mobilized the Army's 101st Airborne Division to escort the nine into the school, calling the mob's actions \\"disgraceful,\\" according to the encyclopedia. The nine entered on September 25. The military presence remained for the entire school year, according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture. However, the harassment did not end after the nine integrated the school. Military guards were assigned to escort the nine students to classes, according to the encyclopedia, but could not go everywhere, and name-calling, kicking and shoving continued in restrooms and locker rooms. \\"I do remember [the family] got a call that he had been knocked out -- someone had hit him on the back of head while he was at a locker in hallway,\\" said Jessie Agee, another sister of Thomas'. \\"But he wanted to continue on with it.\\" When it was time to leave school, he'd run home, and one of his older brothers -- armed with a tire iron -- would wait around a corner to escort him the rest of the way, Agee said. The following year, Faubus closed all the Little Rock high schools to avoid integration, the foundation said. When the high schools reopened for the 1959-60 school year, Thomas and LaNier returned to Central High and graduated in May 1960. \\"We're very sad,\\" Minnijean Brown Trickey, also a member of the nine, told CNN Monday. \\"We were friends before the Little Rock Central crisis, and we've been very close over the years, so it's a great tragedy for us.\\" Thomas was a track athlete at the African-American Dunbar Junior High School in Little Rock when he volunteered to attend Central High as a sophomore, according to his biography on the Little Rock Nine Foundation website. Hildreth said one of the reasons Thomas was inspired to volunteer came to him in biology class. At his old school, the class and the teacher had to share one frog when it came time to dissecting an animal. \\"But he heard at Central, all the students had their own frog to dissect. And he said he wanted to go to Central High because he would be in a class where each student had their own frog,\\" Hildreth recalled. \\"We would laugh about it [later]. He said, 'I just want my own frog.'\\" \\"He found out about the wonderful education they were getting there, and that's what he wanted to experience,\\" Hildreth said. Agee told CNN that everyone in their family, except their mother, thought Thomas' attempt to go to Central was a good idea. \\"She wasn't too keen on it, but she went along with it. His father wanted him to do it. She finally gave in. Him being the youngest, she was very protective of him. And he managed to do it,\\" Agee said. After graduating from Central, he entered Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, but joined his family after they relocated to Los Angeles in 1961. He attended Los Angeles State College, where he was a member of the student government and president of the Associated Engineers. He was inducted into the Army in 1966, and was assigned to duty in south Vietnam with the 9th Infantry Division, the biography said. \\"He served as an infantry squad leader and directed numerous field campaigns as they confronted enemy troops.\\" He returned to civilian life in 1968, where he helped his father run the family business and obtained his bachelor's degree from Los Angeles State College. He went to work as an accounting clerk and later a supervisor for Mobil Oil Corporation's Los Angeles Credit Card Center, while still working with the family business. When Mobile moved its operations to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1978, Thomas chose to stay in Los Angeles and went to work for the Defense Department. When the department relocated some of its Los Angeles operations in 1989, he sold the family business and moved to Columbus. In Columbus, he was active in education and community service. He received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Ohio Dominican University \\"in recognition of his life-long efforts in human rights and equality,\\" the biography said. Thomas was a recipient of the NAACP's Springarn Medal. \\"Date and time are pending for a celebration of Thomas' life in Columbus, Ohio, and Los Angeles, California,\\" the foundation said. Thomas is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, Jefferson Thomas Jr.; and two stepchildren, identified as Frank and Marilyn by the foundation. \\"We volunteered to go to Central, not anticipating the opposition that we would face,\\" Trickey told CNN. It was only after Eisenhower sent in the 1,200 troops that the group was able to enter, she said. \\"We stay in contact because we had that experience, and we grew up together in Little Rock,\\" she said. \\"... we cared so much about each other and felt that, that common experience bonded us in an amazing way.\\" In 1999, the group formed the Little Rock Nine Foundation, which according to its website aims \\"to promote the ideals of justice and equality of opportunity for all.\\" CNN's Jason Hanna and CNN Radio's Michelle Wright contributed to this report.

Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - A mockumentary (a portmanteau of mock and documentary) or docucomedy is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary. - Timothy John Bevan, CBE (born December 1957) is a British film producer, the co-chairman (with Eric Fellner) of the production company Working Title Films. - The Kid from Brooklyn is a 1946 American musical comedy film directed by Norman Z.

It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or folk tale. It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers. - Bloom subsequently established himself as a leading man in Hollywood films such as Balian de Ibelin in Ridley Scott's \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" (2005) and \\"Elizabethtown\\" (2005). He made his professional stage debut in West End's \\"In Celebration\\" at the Duke of York's Theatre in London in 2007 and starred in a Broadway adaption of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" in 2013. In 2009, Bloom was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.

HBO Go will now be available on yet another tablet, the Kindle Fire, through eight out of the top 10 pay TV services in the U.S. And it was just one more incremental move for HBO, as the premium cable company — the leading edge of parent Time Warner’s effort to move the traditional pay TV model into the IP-device world — re-establishes itself as television’s most relevant programming brand. Also read: Preview – How HBO Go on Kindle Fire could boost Amazon’s revenue Yes, HBO is just as important to the evolution of the television business as it was a decade ago, just for different reasons. Instead of bucking the TV establishment with groundbreaking shows, the subscriber-supported service, which still touts an industry-leading 29 million customers, is now carrying the establishment on its back. As traditional TV’s most proliferate brand — available on Xbox 360 game consoles, iPads, Roku set-tops and now Android tablets like Kindle Fire, through a consensus roster of pay TV operators — the fate of HBO Go is the fate of TV Everywhere. Netflix is out there teaching consumers that they can stream all they want for 7.99 a month; HBO is trying un-teach the concept that eight bucks a month will really sustain the kind of truly premium television content you’ve grown accustomed to. And until Netflix proves that it can reliably create a full slate of original hits, no other programmer is as boldly venturing into the multi-device world on the strength of its own content. My zeitgeistiness is gone. Has anyone seen my zeitgeistiness? Certainly, a number of media industry pundits have pondered what HBO isn’t anymore. In April, media writer Michael Wolff explained in The Guardian that in the post-Sopranos era, the network is no longer the “sine qua non of the modern television generation,” i.e. those who are “upwardly mobile, zeitgeisty with-it, and media savvy.” Wolff’s essay followed a March New York Observer story headlined, Is HBO’s Luck Starting to Run Out? The Observer also pondered just how special HBO is anymore, competing in a business in which other cable programmers, from AMC to Showtime, have developed their own Emmy-winning, cinematic-quality adult programs, driven by sharp, independent creative voices. I’ll concede that HBO has lost something in terms of cultural weight and artistic merit — it’ll never be 2004 again, a year in which critically beloved achievements like David Milch’s Deadwood, David Simon’s The Wire and Larry David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm all filled out HBO Sunday night schedules already anchored by still-running hits The Sopranos and Sex and the City. That year was the middle of what Grantland writer Andy Greenwald called television’s “golden age” — an era, kicked off by the introduction of The Sopranos, when a former newspaperman like Simon could get a green light to explore, in the densest of all possible narratives, the interwoven institutional dysfunction of Baltimore (The Wire); or Matthew Weiner, a writer’s-room underling to David Chase on The Sopranos, could get license to make a period drama set in the white-collar world of an ad agency (AMC’s Mad Men). These shows, Greenwald effectively argues, were developed when HBO and AMC were in their younger brand-building stages, able to take chances on acclaimed producers willing to work cheaply in order to freely explore out-there series concepts. The business models — and the ratings expectations — have changed. Top level producers still enjoy ample creative freedom, but they need to be working off of source material with solid commercial foundations. A producer like Alan Ball can make a show like HBO’s True Blood because it’s themed around a popular genre concept (vampires); Frank Darabont can create AMC’s Walking Dead because zombies have also proven to be box-office winners; HBO’s Girls (pictured above) can exist because Sex and the City already showed that female friends living in Manhattan works. HBO’s hit period drama Game of Thrones? Lets just put it this way: the producers of that show came in with an eponymous adaptation of George R.R. Martin’s best-selling novels; when he was pitching The Sopranos in the late-1990s, David Chase was well-regarded as a top show-runner, but all he had was a resume that had Northern Exposure on it. And, of course, it’s always tough to re-create the magic: After Deadwood (right), for example, HBO let Milch develop John From Cincinnati, a strange, etherial drama about a family of Southern California surfers that left viewers and critics trying to get water out of their ears. And last year, Milch and HBO missed again with Luck, a period drama themed around horse-racing that ended up losing the network about 35 million. The cultural touchstones might be gone — not just from HBO, but from TV … everywhere. Has AMC come up with anything as fresh, profound and poignant as Mad Men or Breaking Bad? (I mean, come on, Walking Dead is fun, solid TV, but it is, in the end, just good genre television). And for however many comedic-dramas Showtime creates around female anti-heroes, will it ever top Weeds? Yeah, I think Greenwald might be right — that magic hour, when desperate forces collided in the cable programming business and innovated the narrative story-telling capability of television, is gone. It probably ended in 2007, when Chris Albrecht, the brilliant architect of the programming renaissance HBO foisted upon the industry, was forced out following a very public Las Vegas arrest; or when Rob Sorcher and Christina Wayne, the creative executives who introduced Mad Men and Breaking Bad, left AMC in a huff. I wonder if, in the ultra-fragmented video age we operate in, where DVR/VOD appointments are always pending and the spoiler-alert status is always on orange, if we could even coalesce a water-cooler hit anymore. What would happen if you told your office mates about a new show you saw the night before set in 1960s-era Madison Avenue? If you weren’t told, “Don’t tell me about it — I have it recorded,” you might hear “I watched Downton Abbey on PBS” instead. Maybe, as they try to get attention to their emerging original series accumens, Netflix or Hulu will achieve an old-fashioned HBO level of alchemy, but so far initial efforts like Lilyhammer and Battleground have fallen far short of the mark. The brand plays on For its part, HBO has moved on to its next phase of product innovation — proliferating across platforms. And the programming mandate is different. Its hits may not command the national conversation as say, The Sopranos once did, or Mad Men and Breaking Bad still do. But measuring its audience across platforms — something HBO started doing several years ago, way ahead of most other traditional programmers — the audience for Game of Thrones this season has averaged over 10 million viewers. That’s twice the size of Mad Men‘s audience. There was a time when shows like The Wire, Deadwood and the creepy, Depression-themed Carnival helped HBO stand out and distinguish its brand. The attention from TV critics was nice. But when you’re fighting with Netflix, Hulu and other original-series aspirants, seeking to make potential cord cutters not just cable subscribers, but cable subscribers who pay an additional 12 bucks a month for premium channels, merely appealing to well-educated media consumers in Manhattan and L.A. may not be enough. The Wire gets you the “zeitgeisty with-it.” Game of Thrones gets you authenticated. ||||| HBO Related HBO Says No, for Now, to Fans Who Want a Web-Only Option New York Times It was just one more small step for TV Everywhere.

In April, media writer Michael Wolff explained in The Guardian that in the post-Sopranos era, the network is no longer the “sine qua non of the modern television generation,” i.e. those who are “upwardly mobile, zeitgeisty with-it, and media savvy.” Wolff’s essay followed a March New York Observer story headlined, Is HBO’s Luck Starting to Run Out? The Observer also pondered just how special HBO is anymore, competing in a business in which other cable programmers, from AMC to Showtime, have developed their own Emmy-winning, cinematic-quality adult programs, driven by sharp, independent creative voices. I’ll concede that HBO has lost something in terms of cultural weight and artistic merit — it’ll never be 2004 again, a year in which critically beloved achievements like David Milch’sDeadwood, David Simon’s The Wire and Larry David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm all filled out HBO Sunday night schedules already anchored by still-running hits The Sopranos and Sex and the City. That year was the middle of what Grantland writer Andy Greenwald called television’s “golden age” — an era, kicked off by the introduction of The Sopranos, when a former newspaperman like Simon could get a green light to explore, in the densest of all possible narratives, the interwoven institutional dysfunction of Baltimore (The Wire); or Matthew Weiner, a writer’s-room underling to David Chase on The Sopranos, could get license to make a period drama set in the white-collar world of an ad agency (AMC’s Mad Men). These shows, Greenwald effectively argues, were developed when HBO and AMC were in their younger brand-building stages, able to take chances on acclaimed producers willing to work cheaply in order to freely explore out-there series concepts. (MORE: Google Takes Another Experimental Step Toward Delivering TV) The business models — and the ratings expectations — have changed. Top level producers still enjoy ample creative freedom, but they need to be working off of source material with solid commercial foundations. A producer like Alan Ball can make a show like HBO’s True Blood because it’s themed around a popular genre concept (vampires); Frank Darabont can create AMC’s Walking Dead because zombies have also proven to be box-office winners; HBO’s Girls (pictured above) can exist because Sex and the City already showed that female friends living in Manhattan works. HBO’s hit period drama Game of Thrones? Lets just put it this way: the producers of that show came in with an eponymous adaptation of George R.R. Martin’s best-selling novels; when he was pitching The Sopranos in the late-1990s, David Chase was well-regarded as a top show-runner, but all he had was a resume that had Northern Exposure on it. And, of course, it’s always tough to re-create the magic: After Deadwood, for example, HBO let Milch develop John From Cincinnati, a strange, etherial drama about a family of Southern California surfers that left viewers and critics trying to get water out of their ears. And last year, Milch and HBO missed again with Luck, a period drama themed around horse-racing that ended up losing the network about 35 million. The cultural touchstones might be gone — not just from HBO, but from TV … everywhere. Has AMC come up with anything as fresh, profound and poignant as Mad Men or Breaking Bad? (I mean, come on, Walking Dead is fun, solid TV, but it is, in the end, just good genre television). And for however many comedic-dramas Showtime creates around female anti-heroes, will it ever top Weeds? Yeah, I think Greenwald might be right — that magic hour, when desperate forces collided in the cable programming business and innovated the narrative story-telling capability of television, is gone. It probably ended in 2007, when Chris Albrecht, the brilliant architect of the programming renaissance HBO foisted upon the industry, was forced out following a very public Las Vegas arrest; or when Rob Sorcher and Christina Wayne, the creative executives who introduced Mad Men and Breaking Bad, left AMC in a huff. I wonder if, in the ultra-fragmented video age we operate in, where DVR/VOD appointments are always pending and the spoiler-alert status is always on orange, if we could even coalesce a water-cooler hit anymore. What would happen if you told your office mates about a new show you saw the night before set in 1960s-era Madison Avenue? If you weren’t told, “Don’t tell me about it — I have it recorded,” you might hear “I watchedDownton Abbey on PBS” instead. Maybe, as they try to get attention to their emerging original series accumens, Netflix or Hulu will achieve an old-fashioned HBO level of alchemy, but so far initial efforts like Lilyhammer and Battleground have fallen far short of the mark. The brand plays on For its part, HBO has moved on to its next phase of product innovation — proliferating across platforms. And the programming mandate is different. Its hits may not command the national conversation as say, The Sopranos once did, or Mad Men and Breaking Bad still do. But measuring its audience across platforms — something HBO started doing several years ago, way ahead of most other traditional programmers — the audience for Game of Thrones this season has averaged over 10 million viewers. That’s twice the size of Mad Men‘s audience. (MORE: Apple Wants to Upend the TV Business: Will Big Content Play Ball? There was a time when shows like The Wire, Deadwood and the creepy, Depression-themed Carnival helped HBO stand out and distinguish its brand. The attention from TV critics was nice. But when you’re fighting with Netflix, Hulu and other original-series aspirants, seeking to make potential cord cutters not just cable subscribers, but cable subscribers who pay an additional 12 bucks a month for premium channels, merely appealing to well-educated media consumers in Manhattan and L.A. may not be enough.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which student learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators? Hannah and Joe are two colleagues. They both study horticulture. They've been studying ants lately for their entomology class. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus. Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators. Answer:","completion":"Joe learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators, as he studied ants that farm fungus rather than ants that farm aphids. Hannah, on the other hand, studied ants that farm aphids and thus learned about the ants' mutualistic relationship with aphids and their protective behavior against aphid predators."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They argue that it hinders reconciliation, replaces old wrongs with new wrongs, undermines the achievements of minorities, and encourages groups to identify themselves as disadvantaged, even if they are not. It may increase racial tension and benefit the more privileged people within minority groups at the expense of the disenfranchised within better-off groups (such as lower-class whites and Asians).There has recently been a strong push among American states to ban racial or gender preferences in university admissions, in reaction to the controversial and unprecedented decision in Grutter v. Bollinger. In 2006, nearly 60% of Michigan voters decided to ban affirmative action in university admissions. Michigan joined California, Florida, Texas, and Washington in banning the use of race or sex in admissions considerations. Some opponents believe, among other things, that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive.

Before you can start finishing your basement, you’ll need to make sure that you don’t have uncontrollable mold and moisture problems. Work to stop all mold in your basement and ensure that you can stop water from getting in. If you can’t, then you may need to consider that it would be unwise to continue. Once you know that it’s possible to finish your basement, you’ll need to create a budget to find out how much money you really have to work with. Don’t forget to take into account things like building supplies, extras, labor you’ll need to hire, and the items you’ll need to put in the basement like toilets and showers. Hiring a contractor or a designer may be a good idea, as they can help you figure out how much money you need and where you can save a few bucks. You’ll need drawn out plans, especially if you’re going to be doing the work yourself. You’ll need to know the lengths of all the walls you’ll put in, how much square footage of flooring material you’ll need, how much wall space you need to drywall, etc. Draw out plans for your basement and the changes you plan on making and remember: measure twice, cut once!

This involves eliminating any existing mold and taking preventive measures to keep water from entering the basement. If moisture problems persist or are uncontrollable, it may not be feasible to proceed with the project. Once you have confirmed that your basement can be finished, the next step is to establish a budget. This budget should account for building supplies, additional items (such as toilets and showers), hired labor, and other associated costs. Hiring professionals like contractors or designers can help you better understand the expenses involved and possible areas for cost-saving.

The law is upheld, so where does it go from here? A. Now the scramble to enact the law continues. Unless the law is repealed by Congress, most of the major changes take effect on Jan. 1, 2014. By then, states must have set up health insurance exchanges, where people can buy coverage. Insurers will have to offer policies to anyone who applies, including people with expensive medical conditions. And people who do not qualify for exemptions based on income or religion will be required to have minimum insurance coverage or pay a penalty. Q. In what way was the Medicaid expansion “limited”? What is the meaning of this portion of the decision? A. The Supreme Court’s decision means that the Medicaid expansion is now an option for states, not a requirement. If states do not participate, experts have speculated that it could create a subset of people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid — the exact threshold varies — but not enough to qualify for the tax credits that would help them pay for insurance. States will not have to pick up the added costs of the Medicaid expansion until 2016. After that, the federal government will gradually reduce its contribution until it reaches 90 percent of the costs by 2020. Q. I’m unemployed and can’t afford health care, what does this ruling do for me? A. Beginning in 2014, the law expands Medicaid to cover people who are under 65 and earn income up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or 30,657 for a family of four in 2012. Families who make between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level — or 92,200 for a family of four in 2012 — will be eligible for tax credits for insurance plans that are purchased through state-run exchanges. Q. My parents are screaming about higher taxes from the Affordable Care Act. Any figures for those who have health insurance through our employers already? What does this mean for us? A. The law imposes tax changes that would affect some people who are covered through their employers, especially those in higher tax brackets. Beginning next year, the law increases the Medicare tax by 0.9 percent on earnings over 200,000 for individual taxpayers and 250,000 for married couples filing jointly. It also imposes a 3.8 percent tax on unearned income for high-income households. Q. Does the ruling that allows states to reject the expansion of Medicaid allow states to reject all expanded care in the A.C.A.? A. No. The rest of the law stands. For example, states must continue to set up health insurance exchanges or the federal government may step in operate the exchanges itself. Q. I’ve heard that I’m required to have insurance. When does that go into effect? And what sort of penalties will I face if I don’t comply? A. Starting in 2014, most Americans will be required to have health insurance and could face federal penalties if they do not. Taxpayers will be required to indicate on their tax returns whether they have health insurance that meets minimal benefits standards, according to the Commonwealth Fund. If consumers do not have insurance by 2014, they would owe 95, or 1 percent of taxable income, whichever is greater. The penalty rises to 325, or 2 percent of taxable income in 2015, and then 695, or 2.5 percent of taxable income in 2016, up to a maximum of 2,085 per family. Q. What does the law mean for retirees on Social Security and facing high drug costs? A. The law shrinks the Medicare drug coverage gap known as the “doughnut hole” by requiring pharmaceutical companies to give a 50 percent discount on brand-name drugs. Federal subsidies will gradually fill in the rest of the gap until it is closed by 2020. Q. I am now being covered by a plan in New Jersey that covers people with pre-existing conditions. It ends December 2013. What will happen? A. The high-risk pools that cover people with pre-existing conditions are intended to be a temporary measure until the rest of the law takes effect. Beginning on Jan. 1, 2014, insurers are no longer allowed to turn away customers with pre-existing conditions, and they must charge them rates that are comparable to other healthy people their age. Q. What happens to employees receiving health insurance from small-business employers? A. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees are exempt from penalties that otherwise will be imposed for not covering their workers. Small businesses with fewer than 25 workers and average wages of less than 50,000 get tax credits to help cover their workers. The state health insurance exchanges, which go into effect in 2014, will also allow small businesses to buy coverage there. Q. Will my insurance premium go up? A. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that private health insurance premiums will increase by 5.7 percent each year, on average, from 2012 until 2022. But premiums would be getting more expensive with or without the Affordable Care Act. The budget office has estimated that, relative to what would happen in the absence of the law, premiums in the individual insurance market will be a little higher, employer-sponsored insurance premiums for big companies will be a little lower and employer-sponsored insurance premiums for small companies will stay about the same. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The government passed a law called the Affordable Care Act to help people get health insurance. In 2014, this law will help people who can't afford insurance by giving them money to buy plans. Some people will also qualify for Medicaid, which helps people with lower incomes get healthcare. If you don't get health insurance, you might have to pay a penalty. This law will also help seniors with high drug costs and people with pre-existing conditions get better insurance. Some people will have to pay a new tax, but overall, the law is meant to help more people get affordable healthcare."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve 28*s + 11*s = 195 for s.","completion":"To solve the equation 28s + 11s = 195 for s, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. Since both terms on the left side of the equation contain the variable s, we can add them together. 28s + 11s = (28 + 11)s = 39s Now the equation is simplified: 39s = 195 Step 2: Isolate the variable s. To isolate s, we need to get it by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 39: (39s) / 39 = 195 / 39 s = 5 Step 3: Check the solution. To check if the solution is correct, we can plug the value of s back into the original equation to see if both sides of the equation balance: 28(5) + 11(5) = 195 140 + 55 = 195 195 = 195 Since both sides of the equation balance, the solution s = 5 is correct. Therefore, the solution to the equation 28s + 11s = 195 is s = 5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Traditional typometry units are different from familiar metric units because they were established in the early days of printing. Though most printing is digital now, the old terms and units have persisted. - The thumb is the first digit of the hand. When a person is standing in the medical anatomical position (where the palm is facing to the front), the thumb is the outermost digit. The Medical Latin English noun for thumb is pollex (compare \\"hallux\\" for big toe), and the corresponding adjective for thumb is pollical. - The pica is a typographic unit of measure corresponding to 1 72 of a foot , or 1 6 of an inch . The pica contains 12 point units of measure . The pica originated around 1785 , when François - Ambroise \`\` L'éclat '' Didot ( 1730 -- 1804 ) refined the typographic measures system created by Pierre Simon Fournier le Jeune ( 1712 -- 1768 ) . He replaced the traditional measures of cicéro , Petit - Roman , and Gros - Text with \`\` ten - point '' , \`\` twelve - point '' , etc. To date , in printing these three pica measures are used : The French pica of 12 Didot points ( also called cicéro ) generally is : 12 × 0.376 = 4.512 mm ( 0.177 in ) . The American pica measure of 0.013837 ft. ( 1 72.27 ft ) . Thus , a pica is 0.166044 in . ( 4.2175 mm ) The contemporary computer pica is 1 72 of the International foot of 1959 , i.e. 4.233 mm or 0.166 in . Note that these definitions are different from a typewriter 's pica setting , which denotes a type size of ten characters per horizontal inch . Usually , pica measurements are represented with an upper - case \`\` P '' with an upper - right - to - lower - left virgule ( slash ) starting in the upper right portion of the \`\` P '' and ending at the lower left of the upright portion of the \`\` P '' ; essentially drawing a virgule ( / ) through a \`\` P '' . ( P ) Likewise , points are represented with number of points before a lower - case \`\` p '' , for example , 5p represents \`\` 5 points '' , and 6P2p represents \`\` 6 picas and 2 points '' , and 1P1 represents \`\` 13 points '' , which is converted to a mixed fraction of 1 pica and 1 point . Publishing applications such as Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress represent pica measurements with whole - number picas left of a lower - case \`\` p '' , followed by the points number , for example : 5p6 , represents 5 picas and 6 points , or 5 picas . Cascading Style Sheets defined by the World Wide Web Consortium use \`\` pc '' as the abbreviation for pica ( 1/6 of an inch ) , and \`\` pt '' for point ( 1/72 of an inch ) . - The metric system is an internationally agreed decimal system of measurement. It was originally based on the and the introduced by the French First Republic in 1799, but over the years the definitions of the metre and the kilogram have been refined, and the metric system has been extended to incorporate many more units. Although a number of variants of the metric system emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the term is now often used as a synonym for \\"SI\\" or the \\"International System of Units\\"the official system of measurement in almost every country in the world. - Middle English (ME) is collectively the varieties of the English language spoken after the Norman Conquest (1066) until the late 15th century; scholarly opinion varies but the Oxford English Dictionary specifies the period of 1150 to 1500. This stage of the development of the English language roughly followed the High to the Late Middle Ages. - The yard (abbreviation: yd) is an English unit of length, in both the British imperial and US customary systems of measurement, that comprises 3 feet or 36 inches. It is by international agreement in 1959 standardized as exactly 0.9144 meters. A metal yardstick originally formed the physical standard from which all other units of length were officially derived in both English systems. - The Germanic languages are a branch of the Indo-European language family spoken natively by a population of approximately 500 million people mainly in North America, Oceania, Southern Africa, and Central, Western and Northern Europe. It is the third most spoken Indo-European subdivision, behind Italic and Indo-Iranian, and ahead of Balto-Slavic languages. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information. - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. - An inch (abbreviation: in or ) is a unit of length in the imperial and United States customary systems of measurement now formally equal to yard but usually understood as of a foot. Derived from the Roman uncia (\\"twelfth\\"), \\"inch\\" is also sometimes used to translate related units in other measurement systems, usually understood as deriving from the width of the human thumb. Traditional standards for the exact length of an inch have varied in the past, but since the adoption of the international yard during the 1950s and 1960s it has been based on the metric system and reckoned as exactly 2.54cm. Name. The English word \\"inch\\" was an early borrowing from Latin \\"\\" (\\"one-twelfth; Roman inch; Roman ounce\\") not present in other Germanic languages. The vowel change from Latin /u/ to English // is known as umlaut. The consonant change from the Latin /k/ to English /t/ or // is palatalisation. Both were features of Old English phonology. \\"Inch\\" is cognate with \\"ounce\\", whose separate pronunciation and spelling reflect its reborrowing in Middle English from Anglo-Norman \\"unce\\" and \\"ounce\\". - In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object. In the International System of Quantities, length is any quantity with dimension distance. In other contexts \\"length\\" is the measured dimension of an object. For example, it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter than wire thickness. - An ounce (abbreviated oz; apothecary symbol: ) is a unit of mass used in most British derived customary systems of measurement. It is most pervasive in the retail sale of groceries in the United States, but is also used in many other matters of domestic and international trade. Similar customary uses include recipes in cookbooks and sales of bulk dry goods. - Typesetting is the composition of text by means of arranging physical types or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called sorts in mechanical systems and glyphs in digital systems) are retrieved and ordered according to a language's orthography for visual display. Typesetting requires the prior process of designing a font (which is widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for typeface). One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of works could be spotted more easily, making it difficult for copiers who have not gained permission.

Jason Munt said him and Carly Furnish got beamed up by a bunch of aliens just after he'd boldly gone with her in the car park woods. It was the boldly going bit people thought was bullshit. Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog.

In middle school, a lot of kids think it's cool to cuss and toss around four-letter words like a soccer ball at recess. McKay Hatch, 16, launched an initiative to curb the use of profanity. But when McKay Hatch was in eighth grade, he called foul on the cussing he heard. Hatch started the No Cussing Club. It began at his school and then, through his Web site, attracted members of all ages from all 50 states and 30 countries. His efforts even got the attention of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which declared the first week of March \\"No Cussing Week.\\" CNN's Nicole Lapin spoke to the 16-year-old about the recent success of his movement and the trials he overcame to start it. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. McKay Hatch: Actually, when I first went to my parents about the idea, my dad was kind of like, 'No, no, don't do this.' He knew I'd get bullied and teased, which I did, and more. I got a lot of death threats from people, but I realized that through this whole thing that these people were bullies and I wasn't going to let them win. Watch the entire interview with McKay Hatch ». Nicole Lapin: Well, you received not only death threats we should say, McKay. Your site was hacked into, prostitutes were sent to your house. Were you ever scared by any of those threats? Hatch: At first I was actually pretty scared because they said, 'I know where you live.' Our address was posted online on a really big Web site and at first I was scared. But like I said, these are bullies and they wanted me to be scared and I wasn't going to let them win. Lapin: Even with the bullies, even with the threats, is this now in 30 different countries with thousands of members? Is it worth it? Hatch: It's definitely worth it. Now we have members in all 50 states and 30 countries. People are signing up with our Web site nocussing.com and they're taking the pledge to use language to uplift and make people feel good about themselves. That's what this whole club is. Lapin: It's not really about just cussing. It's also about civility.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which happened first, Franz Claasen becoming the first 'free colored\\" landowner or the African slave trade being ended by Denmark?","completion":"Title: The Chronology of Social Milestones: Franz Claasen and Denmark's Abolition of the Slave Trade Introduction: The history of the African slave trade and the struggle for racial equality are undeniably interconnected. Two events – Franz Claasen becoming the first \\"free colored\\" landowner, and the abolition of the African slave trade by Denmark – stand as milestones symbolizing hope and progress. But which of these two events happened first? In this article, we will take an in-depth look at the timeline of these two historical events and determine their chronological order. Step 1: Research on Franz Claasen as the first \\"free colored\\" landowner To determine when Franz Claasen became the first \\"free colored\\" landowner, we'll need to delve into the available historical records. Our preliminary research reveals that Franz Claasen, a former slave, was a South African man who lived in the Cape Colony during the Dutch colonial rule. He was granted his freedom in 1676 and, thereafter, acquired land in Stellenbosch in 1679, making him the first known \\"free colored\\" landowner in South Africa. Step 2: Research on the end of the African slave trade by Denmark Now that we have the relevant information about Franz Claasen's milestone, we'll turn our attention to Denmark's abolition of the African slave trade. Denmark was among the first European countries to abolish the trade in African slaves. A thorough investigation into historical records indicates that the Danish parliament passed a law to abolish the slave trade in Danish colonies on March 16, 1792, which came into full effect on January 1, 1803. Step 3: Comparison of the two events With the critical information gathered for both milestones, we can now accurately compare their dates: 1. Franz Claasen becoming the first \\"free colored\\" landowner – 1679 2. The African slave trade being abolished by Denmark – 1792 (enforced in 1803) Conclusion: Based on our research, it is clear that Franz Claasen becoming the first \\"free colored\\" landowner (1679) preceded Denmark's end to the African slave trade (1792). While both events signify important steps in the path toward racial equality and the cessation of the inhumane slave trade, their chronology establishes that the beginning of progress was marked by individual struggles, such as Claasen's, which ultimately culminated in collective efforts, like that of Denmark, to bring about systemic change."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jason moved far overseas without Logan since","completion":"Jason moved far overseas without Logan since he received an amazing job opportunity that he couldn't refuse. He felt a mix of excitement and sadness, as this meant leaving behind his best friend, Logan. They had been nearly inseparable since kindergarten, and the idea of being thousands of miles apart was daunting. Step 1: Introduce Jason's new life and work As Jason settled into his new life in this foreign country, he began working diligently at his new job as a software engineer. The company he joined was a leading technology firm, and the work environment was both challenging and stimulating. However, the absence of Logan left a void in his life that he struggled to fill. He spent his evenings exploring the city, tasting exotic foods, and trying to make new friends. But he couldn't shake off the constant longing for his old pal. Step 2: Show Jason's attempts to maintain a connection with Logan To bridge the distance, Jason and Logan set up weekly video calls, where they would catch up on each other's lives and share their experiences. Jason listened intently as Logan narrated stories of their hometown, and Logan eagerly took in Jason's tales of his new adventures. Despite this, they both felt that it wasn't enough; the bond they shared could never be truly replaced through video calls alone. Step 3: Introduce a catalyst One day, Jason received an email from a local cultural center, inviting him to join a weekend workshop on the traditional dance of his new country. Seeing this as an opportunity to immerse himself in the local culture and make new friends, he signed up. Maybe, he thought, this kind of experience would help fill the void that Logan's absence had left. Step 4: Describe Jason's experience at the workshop At the workshop, Jason was teamed up with a lively, friendly local named Maria. Together, they awkwardly tried to navigate the challenging dance steps, laughing at their own mistakes and clumsiness. Through this shared experience, Jason and Maria quickly became friends, and she introduced him to her circle of friends, who welcomed him with open arms. Step 5: Develop Jason's transition and growth As time went on, Jason began feeling more at home in his new country. He formed meaningful connections with his new friends, who showed him all the hidden gems of the city and helped him understand the local customs and traditions. Even as he created new bonds, he continued maintaining his strong friendship with Logan. The weekly video calls never stopped. Step 6: Introduce a plan for the future One evening, during one of their video calls, Jason shared an idea with Logan. He proposed that they should plan a big trip together, with a dual purpose: for Logan to visit him and explore his new country, and afterward, for both of them to set off on a backpacking adventure through neighboring countries. This way, they could create new memories together while exploring the world. Step 7: Conclude the story Both excited about the plan, Jason and Logan started researching possible routes and making arrangements. This newfound sense of purpose brought them even closer, despite the distance that physically separated them. Jason realized that friendships weren't defined by proximity, but by the genuine bond forged between two hearts. And as their adventure drew near, they knew that no matter where life took them, their friendship would continue to flourish and grow."},{"prompt":"Q: Question: what is the highest point in oahu?

When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby. Initially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake. When Carrie disobeys her father's rules regarding visits to the nearest town, Hank decides to punish Carrie by temporarily relocating Flicka to the farm of one of his ranch hands, Toby. After a midnight visit by Carrie, Flicka tries to follow Carrie home to Hank's ranch, but accidentally ends up on the ranch belonging to Amy's father HD Walker.

It has borders with many countries, including Russia. In the past few days, some airplanes from Russia have been flying into the sky above Turkey. This is a big problem because countries have their own space in the sky, just like in a playground, and they don't like when others come into their space without asking. Turkey's leader, a man called Ahmet Davutoglu, who is the Prime Minister, said he wants to make sure his country's borders stay safe and that no one comes into their space without permission. He doesn't want the airplanes from Russia to keep coming into Turkey's sky. However, Turkey is also friends with a big group of other countries called NATO. NATO stands for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They are like a big team of friends that help each other out when someone needs it. Turkey doesn't want the problems with Russia to become a bigger issue that could cause trouble for their NATO friends. So, what is Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu saying?

As well as scoring a UK top twenty trad jazz hit, he helped the careers of many musicians, notably the blues singer Ottilie Patterson, who was at one time his wife, and vocalist/banjoist Lonnie Donegan, whose appearances with Barber triggered the skiffle craze of the mid-1950s and who had his first transatlantic hit, \\"Rock Island Line\\", while with Chris Barber's band. His providing an audience for Donegan and, later, Alexis Korner makes Barber a significant figure in the British rhythm and blues and \\"beat boom\\" of the 1960s. The 2017 line up is; Chris Barber and Bob Hunt (trombones); Mike Henry and Pete Rudeforth (trumpets), Bert Brandsma, Nick White and Ian Killoran (clarinets and alto sax, tenor sax, baritone sax). John Watson (drums), John Day (double bass), Joe Farler (banjo & guitar) Pat Halcox, trumpeter with the Chris Barber Band since 31 May 1954, retired after playing his last gig with the Big Chris Barber Band on 16 July 2008. Halcox and Barber were together in the band for 54 years - the longest continuous partnership in the history of jazz, exceeding even that of Duke Ellington and Harry Carney (48 years between 1926 and 1974). Tony Carter (reeds) also left the band at this time. Vic Pitt (double bass) retired in January 2007 after 30 years with the band. His feature duet with the drummers of the day - \\"Big Noise From Winnetka\\" was not only a feature of the Barber concerts, but also his time with the Kenny Ball band immediately before. When Amy Roberts joined the band in 2011, she was still a student at Royal Northern College of Music and thus not always able to be present. On several tours Bert Brandsma (reeds) replaced her. Brandsma joined as a permanent member in 2012. At St Luke's, London, on 9 June 2007 Barber appeared in the horn section of Nick Lowe's band during a concert. In 2008 Barber, along with Eric Clapton and others, were involved in a new co-operative record company, Blues Legacy. On 23 July 2009, Barber, Bilk and Ball played a one-off concert at Indigo2 at the O2 in Greenwich. The concert was presented by the British Music Experience.

He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

They must now set out to discover the truth behind their bizarre situation. As the story unfolds, Stella and Elle first suspect that they might be victims of some extraterrestrial force or the shuttle expedition somehow altered their reality during the time they spent on Seloria.

Given the question: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds. \\"We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,\\" said professor Desai, who led the study. \\"But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.\\" Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters. The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure. \\"Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,\\" he said. \\"The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.\\" Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. Why did experts pay little attention to the problem of Atlantis? A) Because it worked perfectly. B) Because the right booster was still OK. C) Because nothing serious happened then. D) Because fewer people died in the flight.

The incident left both the responders and the witnesses in a state of shock and anguish, haunted by the events that unfolded before their eyes. The NYPD has now launched a manhunt to track down the unidentified assailant, who managed to escape the station after the incident. The investigators have released a description of the individual, calling for public support to help apprehend the suspect and bring him to justice. Meanwhile, detectives are thoroughly examining available CCTV footage and are trying to piece together a clearer picture of the events that led to the tragic death of Joshua Basin. This horrendous incident has left the community devastated and understandably concerned about safety in and around public transportation facilities. In response, local authorities have announced plans to increase security measures at subway stations, aiming to prevent any similar occurrences in the future. The family and friends of Joshua Basin are mourning the loss of the young man, who was known to be full of potential and well-loved by those who were fortunate enough to have known him. As they grapple with this profound grief, they are also faced with the painful reality that his life was taken so senselessly and violently. As the hunt for the perpetrator continues, the community stands united in their support for the victim's family and their desire for justice. The devastating events that transpired on Saturday evening serve as a grim reminder to all of the fragility of life – and the importance of ensuring that public spaces remain safe environments for everyone. In memory of Joshua Basin, a vigil is scheduled to take place near the Greenpoint Avenue Station this weekend, offering a space for mourners to gather and pay their respects to the young man whose life was cut tragically short."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Stallman was born to Alice Lippman, a school teacher, and Daniel Stallman, a printing press broker, in 1953 in New York City. Stallman had a difficult relationship with his parents, as his father had a drinking habit and verbally abused his stepmother. He later came to describe his parents as \\"tyrants\\". He was interested in computers at a young age; when Stallman was a pre-teen at a summer camp, he read manuals for the IBM 7094. Context: As a first-year student at Harvard University in fall 1970, Stallman was known for his strong performance in Math 55. He was happy: \\"For the first time in my life, I felt I had found a home at Harvard.\\" In 1971, near the end of his first year at Harvard, he became a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and became a regular in the hacker community, where he was usually known by his initials, RMS (which was the name of his computer accounts). Stallman received a bachelor's degree in physics (magna cum laude) from Harvard in 1974. Stallman considered staying on at Harvard, but instead he decided to enroll as a graduate student at MIT. He pursued a doctorate in physics for one year, but left that program to focus on his programming at the MIT AI Laboratory. While working (starting in 1975) as a research assistant at MIT under Gerry Sussman, Stallman published a paper (with Sussman) in 1977 on an AI truth maintenance system, called dependency-directed backtracking. This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems. As of 2009, the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking. The technique of constraint recording, wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper. As a hacker in MIT's AI laboratory, Stallman worked on software projects such as TECO, Emacs for ITS, and the Lisp machine operating system (the CONS of 1974-1976 and the CADR of 1977-1979--this latter unit was commercialized by Symbolics and LMI starting around 1980). He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which at that time was funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. When MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20% of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward. Question: what did he study at Harvard? Answer:","completion":"At Harvard University, Richard Stallman studied mathematics and physics. He was particularly known for his strong performance in Math 55 during his first year. He eventually received a bachelor's degree in physics (magna cum laude) from Harvard in 1974."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question 2: How can I play video from one file and audio from another file simultaneously so that I can enjoy video playback from one file and audio from another? Choose from: [i] no; [ii] yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Question 1: What is the best way of moving a really big file from one computer to another? The best way to move a really big file from one computer to another depends on your available resources, time constraints, and the size of the file. Here are a few different methods to consider: 1. External hard drive: Using an external hard drive is one of the most straightforward ways to move a large file between computers. Connect the drive to the source computer, copy the file to the drive, then connect the drive to the destination computer and copy the file from the drive to the new location. This method is relatively fast and is suitable for files that are too large for other transfer methods. 2. Network transfer: If both the source and destination computers are on the same local network, you can transfer the file directly between them without using an external drive. Set up a shared folder on one of the computers, then copy the file to that shared folder using the other computer. This can take a while depending on your network speed and file size, but it's convenient because it doesn't require additional hardware. 3. Cloud storage: Uploading the file to a cloud storage service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive is another option, particularly if the computers are not in the same physical location. Upload the file to your chosen cloud storage from one computer, then download it to the other. This method can be slow, depending on your internet connection speed and the file size, and it might require a paid subscription to accommodate large files. 4. File transfer tools: Some applications, like FileZilla, TeraCopy, and Resilio Sync, are specifically designed for transferring large files quickly and efficiently. These tools often use optimized algorithms to improve transfer speeds and can handle files of any size. 5. Physical mail: In some cases, especially when transferring really large files and when there's no time constraint, it might be more convenient to copy the file to an external hard drive or high-capacity USB drive and then physically mail it to the recipient. This is often referred to as the \\"sneakernet\\" method. Question 2: How can I play video from one file and audio from another file simultaneously so that I can enjoy video playback from one file and audio from another? To play video from one file and audio from another file simultaneously, you will need to use a media player that supports this functionality. Here are two popular media players that allow you to do this: 1. VLC Media Player: - Open the video file in VLC Media Player. - Pause the video. - In the menu, go to \\"Audio\\" -> \\"Audio Track\\" -> \\"Open File.\\" - Browse to the audio file and select it. - The audio will now play in sync with the video. You can adjust the synchronization by going to \\"Tools\\" -> \\"Track Synchronization.\\" 2. MPC-HC (Media Player Classic - Home Cinema): - Open the video file in MPC-HC. - Pause the video. - In the menu, go to \\"Play\\" -> \\"Filters\\" -> \\"MPC Audio Renderer\\" -> \\"Properties.\\" - Click \\"Add External File,\\" browse to the audio file, and select it. - The audio will now play in sync with the video. You can adjust the synchronization by using the +/- keys on your keyboard or going to \\"View\\" -> \\"Options\\" -> \\"Internal Filters\\" -> \\"Audio Switcher.\\" Regarding whether the answer to these two questions would be the same, the answer is [ii] yes, because the methods and tools discussed in each question vary significantly. Question 1 focuses on transferring large files between computers, while question 2 deals with playing video and audio from separate files simultaneously."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gomez's lawyer Tully Alford owes money to loan shark Abigail Craven, and notices that her son Gordon closely resembles Fester. Tully proposes that Gordon pose as Fester to infiltrate the Addams household and find the hidden vault where they keep their vast riches. Tully and his wife Margaret attend a sÃ©ance at the Addams home led by Grandmama in which the family tries to contact Fester's spirit. Gordon arrives, posing as Fester, while Abigail poses as psychiatrist Dr. Pinder-Schloss and tells the family that Fester had been lost in the Bermuda Triangle for the past 25 years. Gomez, overjoyed to have Fester back, takes him to the family vault to view home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns the reason for the brothers' falling-out: Gomez was jealous of Fester's success with women, and wooed the conjoined twins Flora and Fauna Amor away from him out of envy. Gomez starts to suspect that \\"Fester\\" is an impostor when he is unable to recall important details about their past. Gordon attempts to return to the vault, but is unable to get past a booby trap. Gomez's wife Morticia reminds \\"Fester\\" of the importance of family amongst the Addamses and of their vengeance against those who cross them. Fearing that the family is getting wise to their con, Abigail (under the guise of Dr. Pinder-Schloss) convinces Gomez that his suspicions are due to displacement. Gordon grows closer to the Addams family, particularly the children Wednesday and Pugsley, whom he helps to prepare a swordplay sequence for a school play. The Addamses throw a large party with their extended family and friends to celebrate Fester's return, during which Abigail plans to break into the vault.

Jimmy is dumped by his unscrupulous girlfriend, and Fletch is fired from his job as a clown for punching a child. They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi). They are invited to join a party on the bus. The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a lesbian vampire on her 18th birthday.

Answer the following question: Information: - A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells. - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - Menangle virus is a virus that infects pigs , humans and bats . - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. What is the relationship between 'menangle virus' and 'species'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between the Menangle virus and species lies in the virus's ability to infect and impact various species, including pigs, humans, and bats. These species can be potentially affected by the Menangle virus, which is an infectious agent replicating inside the living cells of other organisms. This relationship between the virus and species showcases the interconnectedness and complexity of biological systems. In the context of this information, 'species' refers to distinct groups of organisms that share similar characteristics and can interbreed to produce fertile offspring. In the case of Menangle virus, it impacts the following species: 1. Pigs: Pigs belong to the genus Sus within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates, and they encompass the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals that can be affected by the Menangle virus, possibly leading to health issues or disruptions in the pig's population dynamics. 2. Humans: As part of the animal kingdom and members of the species Homo sapiens, humans are also susceptible to infection by the Menangle virus. Although rare, transmission from pigs to humans has been reported, posing potential public health concerns. 3. Bats: Bats represent another group of species that can be affected by the Menangle virus. These mammals serve as natural reservoirs for various viruses and may play a crucial role in the transmission and maintenance of the Menangle virus in nature. Thus, the relationship between the Menangle virus and species lies in the virus's ability to infect and affect multiple species' health and potentially trigger cascading effects within various ecosystems. Studying this relationship further can help us better understand the virus's transmission pathways, its potential risks to affected species' populations, and possible methods for preventing or controlling its spread."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Movie title: Shriek of the Mutilated Context: A very brief pre-credits sequence shows an execution beside a pool, where a young blindfolded woman is decapitated by a man while two other complicit individuals watch.At a university, Dr. Ernst Prell (Alan Brock) lectures a small group of four students, Keith (Michael Harris), Karen (Jennifer Stock), Lynn (Darcy Brown), and Tom (Jack Neubeck). Prell gives them a presenation on the Yeti, displaying slides with representations of what the unknown beast might look like based on descriptions of supposed eyewitnesses. Prell is planning an expedition with the four graduate students to Boot Island, where his associate Dr. Karl Werner (Tawm Ellis) lives. Werner has told Prell that he suspects a yeti lurks in the woods around his estate, and Prell intends to capture evidence proving the creature's existence. Prell seems particularly interested in Keith, and takes him to dinner at an exclusive restaurant, where he orders a meal for them that isn't on the menu, a special dish called \\"gin sung\\".The other students go to a party where they meet a former student of Prell's, Spencer Ste. Clair (Tom Grail). Spencer starts drinking, much to the objection of his wife (Luci Brandt), and when he overhears the students talking about the expedition with Prell, Spencer causes a scene at the party. He becomes hysterical, recounting his own experience on one of Prell's expeditions 8 years prior. Spencer and Prell were the only ones to survive, the others presumably killed by the yeti, which Spencer says attacked him and left him for dead. The people at the party don't take Spencer's story seriously, and he and his wife leave.

Earth Answer:","completion":"Title: Invaders of Metaluna Plot Summary: In the depths of the cosmos, the distant and advanced civilization of the Metalunans is facing the imminent destruction of their home planet, Metaluna, due to a dying sun and catastrophic solar flares. Desperate to save their people, the Metalunan leaders, led by King Zargon, seek out a new planet to relocate their entire population. After years of searching and numerous attempts at contact, the desperate Metalunans finally set their sights on Earth. Act 1: The movie opens with a series of increasingly powerful solar flares devastating the planet Metaluna. The viewer is introduced to the Metalunans, a technologically advanced species with an innate connection to metal, which they use to create and power their incredible technology. The Metalunans' close bond with their planet has allowed them to endure the increasingly harsh conditions for centuries. However, they have now come to the realization that they cannot survive much longer on their dying world. Desperate to save their people, King Zargon and his council summon the best and brightest minds to create a plan to find a new home. Xandra, a brilliant scientist, discovers Earth—a planet with abundant resources and a climate suitable for the Metalunans. Fascinated by the human race and their technology, Xandra sets off to Earth to establish contact and secure a lifeline for her civilization. However, her arrival does not go unnoticed by the humans. Act 2: Military and intelligence operatives detect Xandra's arrival with awe and trepidation. Fearful of the unknown, the human leaders attempt to make contact with the alien visitor. Despite their cultural differences and initial miscommunications, Xandra eventually befriends Jessica, a brilliant scientist working for the government, and shares the urgent need of her people. Jessica, moved by the plight of the Metalunans, takes the matter to the world's leaders, urging them to cooperate. However, the governments of Earth are divided—some leaders see the Metalunans as potential allies, while others are wary of the consequences of allowing an extraterrestrial species to settle on Earth. Act 3: With time running out for the Metalunans, tension between the human governments reaches a boiling point. As conflicts arise, Jessica feverishly works alongside Xandra to develop a plan for peaceful coexistence, leading to the establishment of a groundbreaking space alliance. Meanwhile, King Zargon, growing impatient and desperate, takes matters into his own hands, assembling a fleet of warships to secure Earth by force, if necessary. In the climactic final act, Jessica and Xandra must race against time to convince the world's leaders to unite against the approaching warships and present the peaceful coexistence plan. Just as tensions escalate and a war between humans and Metalunans seems inevitable, the united front of Earth's nations stands tall, convincing King Zargon that peace is the best course of action. Epilogue: King Zargon accepts the proposal, preventing war and ushering in a new era of cooperation between the Metalunans and humans. The Metalunans find a new homeland on Earth, and together with their human counterparts, embark on a journey to advance both species' technology and understanding, eventually stabilizing Metaluna's sun and rebuilding their home planet. \\"Invaders of Metaluna\\" becomes a thrilling tale of survival, diplomacy, and the power of unity, as two vastly different races come together to preserve their futures and change the course of the galaxy forever."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Manchester City 3-1 Everton Sergio Agüero of Manchester City scores his team's second goal against Everton in the Premier League at Etihad Stadium. Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images The big news was that Joe Hart kept his place as Manuel Pellegrini fingered Micah Richards, Gaël Clichy and Matija Nastasic as the chief culprits from the defence that played in the miserable 3-1 defeat to Bayern Munich here on Wednesday evening. This meant Hart and Vincent Kompany were the sole survivors from that back five, with Jesús Navas and Edin Dzeko also being dropped ahead of an afternoon that would prove fine entertainment. The contest pitted a Manchester City that hoped to avert a third consecutive defeat against an Everton seeking to maintain the division's only unbeaten record. By the time Sergio Agüero claimed his second, on 69 minutes, to give his gang a 3-1 advantage, it would be City who had accomplished their mission, though Everton continue to look a fair outside bet to challenge for a Champions League berth. Although Hart was at fault for Everton's goal he would also be cheered for every regulation catch, save or kick he performed as the home crowd followed Pellegrini's decision to stand by his man by offering their support. While Kompany would last only 34 minutes before an injury meant Nastasic was restored, the contest lit up just past the quarter hour mark. This was when Romelu Lukaku collected a fourth of the season from a strike that will again focus scrutiny on Hart. The on-loan Chelsea forward took the ball, moved too easily past Joleon Lescott inside the area, then aimed an effort that went to the right of the goalkeeper. Hart got a glove to the ball but the failure to make the save will disappoint. With the Etihad Stadium still digesting this, City moved up-field and equalised almost instantly through Alvaro Negredo. Every time the \\"Beast of Vallecas\\" features for the Blues he makes an impact. In the hiding received from Bayern, Negredo entered as a second-half replacement ahead of pirouetting and potting sweetly beyond Manuel Neuer, for his team's consolation goal. Selected in the starting XI on Saturday, the Spaniard was in the right place at the right time to finish an eye-catching move. Fernandinho drilled a pass into David Silva, who ensured Yaya Touré received possession precisely where he would want. The Ivorian, particularly disappointing against the Germans, found Negredo and he pulled the trigger to slip the ball under Tim Howard for a fourth City goal of his debut season. Passages now ensued where City were given the runaround by this bright Everton side, though these became almost nonexistent during the second period. Ross Barkley continues to impress, his ability to ghost past opponents with his head up reminiscent of a young Paul Gascoigne. An illustration came when, in a central position, the Everton No20 skipped forward and looped the ball on to Kevin Mirallas's head, who drew an impressive save from Hart, before Martin Atkinson blew for offside. City's second came moments after Negredo and Seamus Coleman engaged in an argument near Everton's goal, which consisted of the latter accusing the former of going down too easily. Play had moved near City's end before, when it returned, Silva slid a cold-eyed ball along the inside right channel to Agüero. The diminutive Argentinian turned on the after-burners to gain half a yard, then rifled the shot past Howard. Pellegrini, who had had an animated conversation with James Milner after Everton's opener, showed further disquiet following the incident that forced Aleksandar Kolarov off on 57 minutes. After Steven Naismith shoved Nastasic into the left-back, Kolarov suffered a facial injury that meant Clichy should have been primed to enter, having warmed up. Instead, the Frenchman sat back on the bench to leave Pellegrini waving him back while asking his assistant Brian Kidd what, exactly, had occurred. The same question might have been asked of Atkinson of the 68th-minute penalty he awarded. Coleman made minimal contact with Pablo Zabaleta yet the referee still pointed to the spot. Agüero chose the nonchalant approach to execution and came close to coming unstuck: his spot-kick was a pea-roller that did not fool Howard, who palmed the ball on to his left post only for it to rebound from his head and in. Summary:","completion":"Manchester City played against Everton in a soccer game. It was a fun and exciting match to watch. Manchester City wanted to win, so they wouldn't lose three games in a row. Everton wanted to win too, because they hadn't lost any games yet. In the end, Manchester City won the game with a score of 3-1. There were some really cool and skillful moments during the game, like when Sergio Agüero scored his second goal to help his team win.

Being that Ace's influence is disruptive to the monastery, the Grand Abbot eagerly gives Ace excuses by which to justify his departure.Greenwall asks Ventura to find a sacred animal called Shikaka, which has become a point of contention. Shikaka, which is a great white bat, is a sacred animal for the Wachati and Wachootoo tribes of Nibia; whenever its name is spoken, the tribesmen must bow. Accompanied by his capuchin monkey, Spike, Ace travels to Africa and returns to his pet detective work.After arriving in Nibia and meeting with the head of the consulate, Vincent Cadby, Ace begins learning about his case as well as the possible suspects.

His career subsequently halted after his 6th birthday. Since his heyday, he has been reduced to parking cars at Morton's and appearing on Celebrity Boxing, where he is matched with Emmanuel Lewis. In the public eye and to his girlfriend Cyndi who apparently leaves him during a roadside incident, Dickie is washed up. After talking to an old friend, Leif Garrett, Dickie is absolutely convinced that a new Rob Reiner movie in the works, Mr. Blake's Backyard, will be his comeback vehicle. Even after Sidney, his agent, does not land him an audition, Dickie persists. While on duty at Morton's, he joy rides in a customer's vehicle, drops into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and he pesters Tom Arnold to hook him up with Reiner. After he is kicked out because he's not an alcoholic, Dickie fakes being wasted and crashes what turns out to be a Lamaze class. However, Brendan Fraser (in an uncredited cameo appearance) is in the class and, finding his entrance to the class hilarious and ridiculous, he agrees to help him out and calls Reiner for Dickie. Reiner bluntly tells Dickie that the part is not within his abilities because it requires knowing how a regular person lives.

Answer the following question: Article: There are plenty of different parks to visit in the UK. All theme parks in Britain have cafes, restaurants, picnic areas and gift shops, so you'll still have plenty to see and do when you and the kids have been on enough rides. There are usually smaller \\"funfair\\" rides and games as well, so younger children won't get bored. Several theme parks also have other attractions next to them, e.g. water parks often open all year round, unlike the theme parks. Wherever you are in Britain, there's likely to be a theme park within one or two hours' drive, bus ride or train journey. Several theme parks even have accommodation so you can stay for a day or two if you want to make a trip into a short holiday. Prices for UK theme parks vary considerably; some have an entrance price which allows you to go on all the rides, while in others you have to pay for every ride individually. It can also make a difference whether you go during peak time or not. For example, tickets always cost more during school holidays and weekends than they do during the weekdays. Theme parks always get very busy during the summer months, so if you don't like crowds, it's usually a good idea to go earlier or later in the year! If you're thinking of visiting a UK theme park, it's worth having a look for special offers on tickets. Products such as chocolate bars and cereals sometimes have \\"buy one get one free\\" offers on theme park tickets, so keep a look out in shops and supermarkets.

The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, it emerges that Roman has made a bad investment and is broke. He has not told Kate and was planning to hit up Chet for the cash. Later, during a thunderstorm, the twins wander off and fall into a mine shaft. Chet and Roman find them, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny mine shaft. After some encouragement from Chet, Roman summons up all his courage, while Chet goes in search of a rope to pull them out. Upon realizing that the mine is stocked with old dynamite, Roman takes his daughters and climbs out of the shaft on his own.

The mills in North Carolina exist because textile capital migrated from the Northeast in pursuit of low wages, no unions, and cheaper materials. Does it follow that \\"All of the mills in the Northeast shut down and moved to North Carolina.\\"?","completion":"It does not directly follow that \\"All of the mills in the Northeast shut down and moved to North Carolina,\\" as the statement is an oversimplification of a more complex historical, economic, and social phenomenon. While it is true that many mills in the Northeast did shut down or relocate to states like North Carolina due to the reasons mentioned, it is important to note that the process was not uniform, and some mills continued to operate in the Northeast for a variety of reasons. There were several factors that contributed to the shift of textile mills from the Northeast to states like North Carolina. As the statement suggests, one major factor was the pursuit of lower wages. Workers in the Northeast, who were often represented by labor unions, demanded higher wages and better working conditions. In contrast, states in the South, particularly North Carolina, had a large supply of workers who were willing to work for lower wages and were not a part of strong union movements. This made it more cost-effective for mill owners to operate in the South. Another factor contributing to the shift was the availability of raw materials, particularly cotton and other fibers, which were more abundant and less expensive in southern states. Moreover, the South's generally milder climate and widespread use of hydroelectric power also played a role in driving down operating costs for the mills. However, it is worth noting that not all mills in the Northeast shut down and moved to North Carolina, or the South in general. Some mills continued to operate due to various factors, such as population density and demand in the Northeast region, diversified product lines that gave them a competitive advantage, or the desire to maintain a family business in their traditional location. Additionally, over time, many of the factors that originally drove mills to North Carolina lessened in impact: international competition, modernization of facilities, and some regional convergence of wages further changed the landscape of the textile industry. In conclusion, the statement that \\"All of the mills in the Northeast shut down and moved to North Carolina,\\" is not entirely accurate. While many mills did indeed relocate or shut down due to the factors mentioned, it is important to recognize that the process was not uniform and some mills did continue to operate in the Northeast. The textile industry's migration from the Northeast to North Carolina, and the South more broadly, is better understood as a multifaceted process influenced by a combination of economic, social, and historical factors, and not as a simple, all-encompassing phenomenon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia? , can you please find it? Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \\"outward growth of the mind's scope\\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\\".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony...","completion":"The full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia, is Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921-22).

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

Question: Who acted as protector to Martin Luther when he was under the ban of the Empire? Answer: The immediate provocation spurring this act was Pope Leo X’s renewal of the indulgence for the building of the new St. Peter's Basilica in 1514. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: No, the given response does not answer the question about who acted as a protector to Martin Luther when he was under the ban of the Empire. The correct answer is Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, also known as Frederick the Wise. Frederick the Wise, who ruled Saxony from 1486 until his death in 1525, was a key political and religious figure in the early years of the Protestant Reformation. He played a significant role in protecting and supporting the German monk and theologian Martin Luther, who was one of the foremost leaders of the Reformation. When Martin Luther displayed his opposition to the Catholic Church's sale of indulgences and numerous other contentious practices, the church resorted to its conventional methods for silencing critics by excommunicating and threatening him with further punishment, including potential death. Pope Leo X excommunicated Luther in 1521, and Luther was soon after declared an \\"outlaw\\" by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V during the Diet of Worms. This essentially meant that anyone could kill Luther without suffering legal consequences, and it urged the political authorities to capture and hand him over to the emperor. In such a precarious situation, Frederick the Wise provided an essential safeguard for Luther. Upon Luther's departure from Worms, Frederick arranged for his abduction and subsequent safekeeping at the Wartburg Castle in Eisenach. Out of public sight and under the alias of Knight George, Luther had the time and security to work on his writings, including his famous translation of the New Testament into German. Frederick the Wise continued to offer protection and support to Luther even as the Reformation took hold in Saxony, creating friction between the regional powers and the Catholic Church. Frederick may not have been a fervent supporter of religious reform, but his principled protection of Martin Luther and his efforts to establish political stability certainly facilitated the growth and maturation of the Protestant Reformation in Germany. Without Frederick III acting as a protector, it is uncertain whether Luther, his ideas, and the Reformation would have thrived as they did."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While journeying to the Soviet port of Batumi to return to the United States to complete his business with the Turkish Navy, Graham and his wife stop in Istanbul and are met by Kopeikin, a Turkish employee of Graham's company, who under the pretense of discussing business, takes Graham to a nightclub to introduce him to dancer Josette Maretl and her partner Gogo. Banat tries unsuccessfully to kill Graham during a magic act, shooting the magician instead. Graham is brought to the headquarters of the Turkish secret police for questioning, where Colonel Haki blames the assassination attempt on German agents seeking to delay the re-arming of Turkish ships. The colonel shows Graham a photograph of Banat, who he says was hired by a Nazi agent named Muller. Haki then orders Graham to travel secretly to Batumi aboard a tramp steamer, while Haki personally oversees the safe overland transit of Stephanie.

Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes. The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. \\"I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,\\" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. \\"As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around.\\" The weather forecast continued to predict mostly dry weather for the area for Friday, with high temperatures from the mid-90s into the 100s, the Forest Service said.

Hot and dry weather combined with a historic drought have made conditions ripe for rapid fire growth. In the past seven days, the Forest Service has responded to 224 fires burning a combined 31,541 acres.

The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000. During these trips the NSC, Treasury, and intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials, and later interviewed members of the Bin Laden family, about Usama's inheritance.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What action does Serena, despite considering Rachel and Jacob a threat, remain unaware of? ? In Depression-era North Carolina, George Pemberton is an ambitious timber baron who meets Serena Shaw, a young woman with a sad past. He falls in love with her, they marry, and Serena comes with George to his land. There, she starts taking control of things, pressuring and questioning George, while remaining affectionate towards him. George's business partner Buchanan feels threatened by her, as she begins to exceed his authority. Things grow worse between George and Buchanan, and Buchanan strikes a deal with the local sheriff, who wants to buy George's land to make a park. George is hurt by Buchanan's betrayal, and Serena convinces George that Buchanan was never his friend. The next day, they both go shooting alone from the group attempting to flush out a bear. After some snide remarks from Buchanan, George contemplates killing him only to hesitate and be seen by Buchanan. As Buchanan cocks his rifle, George fires first and shoots him in the chest. Campbell, George's worker, witnesses the murder, but denies it when Sheriff McDowell inquires. The death is ruled an accident. Serena consoles George and justifies his actions. One day, he sees his illegitimate son, Jacob, posing with his mother, Rachel, for a picture. He feels responsible for the boy, and since Rachel never asked for anything, he begins giving sums of money in envelopes to her for Jacob. Serena remains unaware of this, though she does consider Rachel and the baby a threat. One day, an accident occurs in the forest and Galloway, a mysterious worker, loses his hand to an axe swing. Serena rushes to help him and uses a belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding which saves his life. Having problems with her pregnancy, Serena and George rush to the hospital after Serena experiences heavy bleeding and pain. She miscarries. They learn that she can never again bear children. Things continue to grow worse, and Rachel's baby becomes more obvious to Serena. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The action that Serena, despite considering Rachel and Jacob a threat, remains unaware of is George giving sums of money in envelopes to Rachel for the support of their illegitimate son, Jacob.

Q: The scientific team of Dr. David Conway (William Leslie), Dr. Ellis Morton (Tristram Coffin) and Laura Hutchinson (Kathryn Grant) has built a machine that can predict earthquakes. After predicting one will hit California within the next 24 hours to a uniformly skeptical Gov. Cheney (Raymond Greenleaf) and state-level political and civil defense officials, the earthquake does materialize and does immense damage to northern parts of the state. Now with the support and funding necessary from the reformed skeptics, the team works on further predictions and comes to the conclusion that a wave of earthquakes are pending in and around the southwestern United States. They trace the epicenter of the pending disaster to an area beneath the Carlsbad Caverns and descend to a hitherto unexplored level.Here they find a strange ore which, when removed from contact with water, becomes highly explosive, and realize that this element, somehow working its way from deep in the Earth, is responsible for the earthquakes. Although the material is not analyzed for specific atomic traits, it is named Element 112 just because so far, 111 chemical elements had been discovered.

Answer the question When two objects are touching, heat is transferred from the warmer object to the cooler one by","completion":"When two objects are touching, heat is transferred from the warmer object to the cooler one through a process called conduction. Conduction is the transfer of heat within or between solid objects that are in direct contact with one another. The process occurs due to the collisions between rapidly moving particles and slower moving particles, resulting in the exchange of energy. In any material, the microscopic particles—atoms, molecules, and ions—are in constant motion. As these particles move, they possess kinetic energy. In warmer objects, the particles have more kinetic energy and vibrate at higher speeds. When two objects with different temperatures come into contact, the faster-moving particles of the warmer object collide with the slower-moving particles of the cooler object. As the particles collide, energy is transferred from the higher-energy particles to the lower-energy ones, causing the cooler object's particles to vibrate faster and gain kinetic energy. This leads to a rise in the cooler object's temperature. The transfer of heat through conduction continues until both objects reach thermal equilibrium, meaning that their temperatures become equal. At this point, the net flow of heat energy between the objects ceases, as the rates of energy transfer between them become equal and opposite. The efficiency of heat transfer through conduction depends on several factors: 1. Material properties: The thermal conductivity of the materials involved plays a significant role in determining the rate of heat transfer. Thermal conductivity measures a material's ability to conduct heat. Some materials, like metals, have high thermal conductivity, which means they readily transfer heat. In contrast, insulators, such as wood or plastics, have low thermal conductivity and slow down the transfer of heat. 2. Surface area: The amount of surface area that is in contact between the two objects also affects the rate of conduction. The larger the area of contact, the more particles are available to collide and transfer their energy. This results in a higher rate of heat transfer between the objects. 3. Temperature difference: The greater the difference in temperature between the two objects, the faster heat will be transferred through conduction. This is because the energy difference between the particles in the warmer object and the cooler object will be larger, leading to more effective collisions and energy exchange. 4. Thickness of the material: The thickness of the material also affects the rate of heat transfer. Thicker materials or objects take longer to heat up or cool down, as the heat must travel a greater distance through the material. In summary, when two objects are touching, heat is transferred from the warmer object to the cooler one by conduction. This involves the transfer of kinetic energy from the rapidly moving particles in the warmer object to the slower moving particles in the cooler object, leading to an increase in temperature for the cooler object. The process continues until thermal equilibrium is reached, at which point the net flow of heat between the objects ceases. Factors such as material properties, surface area, temperature difference, and thickness of the materials influence the efficiency of heat transfer through conduction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: What is traditionally added to sulphur and saltpetre to make gunpowder?","completion":"Gunpowder, also known as black powder, is a significant invention dating back to the 9th century in China. It has been used extensively since then for various purposes such as fireworks, weaponry, and mining. Gunpowder consists of three primary ingredients: sulfur, saltpetre (potassium nitrate), and a form of carbon. Traditionally, the carbon source added to sulfur and saltpetre to make gunpowder is charcoal. Charcoal is produced by heating wood or other organic materials in the absence of oxygen, a process called pyrolysis. It mainly consists of elemental carbon, along with small amounts of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements. Charcoal is preferred as the source of carbon in the production of gunpowder because of its porous nature and the advantage it provides as a reliable and efficient fuel for combustion. When combined in appropriate proportions, the three ingredients create a powerful exothermic reaction when ignited. The general ratio of the components in gunpowder is 75% potassium nitrate, 15% charcoal, and 10% sulfur by weight. The potassium nitrate, or saltpetre, acts as an oxidizer, supplying oxygen to support the combustion process. Sulfur serves as a fuel that burns at a low temperature, thereby reducing the ignition temperature and making the mixture more easily ignitable. Finally, charcoal acts as the main fuel component, readily burning in the presence of oxygen supplied by the potassium nitrate and quickly releasing energy in the form of heat and gas. Once ignited, the rapid production of heat and gas generates a significant amount of pressure in a confined space, which can be harnessed to propel projectiles in firearms or create explosive effects for pyrotechnics or mining activities. While modern propellants and explosives have largely replaced traditional gunpowder due to their higher efficiency, increased stability, and reduced smoke production, the significance of gunpowder in shaping human history as an essential component of warfare, mining, and entertainment cannot be understated."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Title: Behind the mask Review: As the author relates his work in the CIA from the early seventies when the American people started challenging our government's role in world politics, to today's even more chaotic world, he's revealed an agency frought with ineptitude and inefficiency. As one of the grunts on the ground, working clandestinely, he's watched in alarm as the effectiveness of the agency has gone from a stellar one gathering behind the scenes information to being a hand-tied-behind-their-backs (dis)organization. It's a fascinating read through the eyes and ears of one who's worked some of the most dangerous parts of the world. Is this product review negative? Choices: + Yes. + No. Answer:","completion":"No, this product review is not negative. Despite describing some challenges and deteriorations in the CIA over time, the reviewer does not express a negative opinion about the product in question, which appears to be a book. The reviewer finds the book to be \\"fascinating\\" and values the author's insider perspective from \\"one of the grunts on the ground\\" and his experience from \\"some of the most dangerous parts of the world.\\" The reviewer may express a negative view of the CIA's progress over the time, pointing out the agency's transition from an efficient intelligence gathering entity to an inept and inefficient organization. However, such criticism related to the contents of the book does not straightly translate to a negative review of the book itself. In fact, this critique may well be part of the reviewer's fascination with the book, as they offer readers a unique, critical insight into the CIA. The areas of ineptitude and inefficiency highlighted by the author might have possibly made the account more engaging and insightful for the reader. The review, thus, does not focus on negative aspects of the book's writing style, structure, or the way it delivers the content, which are classic ways to negatively review a book. Summary executions of the book's protagonists or negative depictions of persons or situations would also be areas where one might look for negativity, but these are not present. Instead, the content seems to offer exactly what a reader could be seeking— an insider's view to the state of affairs within the CIA and its course over time and amidst changing political landscapes. This rarity of viewpoint might be what prompts the reviewer to describe the book as a 'fascinating read.' Therefore, it's safe to conclude that the review in question is not negative in terms of the product (book)."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:Information: - Exmoor is loosely defined as an area of hilly open moorland in west Somerset and north Devon in South West England. It is named after the River Exe, the source of which is situated in the centre of the area, two miles north-west of Simonsbath. Exmoor is more precisely defined as the area of the former ancient royal hunting forest, also called Exmoor, which was officially surveyed 18151818 as in extent. The moor has given its name to a National Park, which includes the Brendon Hills, the East Lyn Valley, the Vale of Porlock and of the Bristol Channel coast. The total area of the Exmoor National Park is , of which 71% is in Somerset and 29% in Devon. - Minehead is a coastal town and civil parish in Somerset, England. It lies on the south bank of the Bristol Channel, north-west of the county town of Taunton, from the border with the county of Devon and in proximity of the Exmoor National Park.

These machines have many sorts of applications in many industries, including: - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - The Anarchy was a civil war in England and Normandy between 1135 and 1154, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order. The conflict was a succession crisis precipitated by the accidental death of William Adelin, the only legitimate son of Henry I, in 1120. Henry's attempts to install his daughter, the Empress Matilda, as his successor were unsuccessful and on Henry's death in 1135, his nephew Stephen of Blois seized the throne with the help of another nephew, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester. Stephen's early reign was marked by fierce fighting with English barons, rebellious Welsh leaders and Scottish invaders. Following a major rebellion in the south-west of England, Matilda invaded in 1139 with the help of her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester. - Dunster Working Watermill ( also known as Castle Mill ) is a restored 18th century watermill , situated on the River Avill , close to Gallox Bridge , in the grounds of Dunster Castle in Dunster , Somerset , England . It is a Grade II * listed building . The mill stands on a site where a mill was first recorded in the Domesday Book , but the present building was constructed around 1780 . It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used to grind flour . The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels . It is owned by the National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company . - Somerset is a county in South West England which borders Gloucestershire and Bristol to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east and Devon to the south-west. It is bounded to the north and west by the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel, its coastline facing southeastern Wales. Its traditional border with Gloucestershire is the River Avon. Somerset's county town is Taunton. - A shell keep is a style of medieval fortification, best described as a stone structure circling the top of a motte. - Dunster Castle is a former motte and bailey castle, now a country house, in the village of Dunster, Somerset, England. The castle lies on the top of a steep hill called the Tor, and has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century. - A textile or cloth is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibres (yarn or thread). Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton, or other material to produce long strands. Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, or felting. - A sawmill or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber. Prior to the invention of the sawmill, boards were rived (split) and planed, or more often sawn by two men with a whipsaw, one above and another in a saw pit below. The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade. - A hammer is a tool or device that delivers a blow (a sudden impact) to an object. Most hammers are hand tools used to drive nails, fit parts, forge metal, and break apart objects. Hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. - Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains or roots and used to make many different foods. Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures, making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history. Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern, North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Bristol is a city, unitary authority area and county in South West England with an estimated population of 449,300 in 2016. It is England's sixth and the United Kingdom's eighth most populous city, and the most populous city in Southern England after London. The city borders the Unitary Authority areas of North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the historic cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively. - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million. - South West England is one of nine official regions of England. It is the largest in area, covering and the counties of Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, as well as the Isles of Scilly. Five million people live in South West England. - A metal (from Greek \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms. - A paper mill is a factory devoted to making paper from vegetable fibres such as wood pulp, old rags and other ingredients using a Fourdrinier machine or other type of paper machine. - The Severn Estuary is the estuary of the River Severn, the longest river in Great Britain. It is at the mouth of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range of about means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy. - The River Avill is a small river on Exmoor in Somerset, England. - A water turbine is a rotary machine that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of water into mechanical work. - Wiltshire (or ) is a county in South West England with an area of . It is landlocked and borders the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The county town was Wilton but Wiltshire Council is now based in the new county town of Trowbridge. - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point. - A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of free-flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load. - A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses moving water as its power source. It is thus a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. Thus watermills may be gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, wire drawing mills, and so on. - Lumber (American English; used only in North America), or timber (used in the rest of the English speaking world) is wood that has been processed into beams and planks, a stage in the process of wood production. Lumber may also refer to currently un-needed furniture, as in Lumber room, or an awkward gait, ultimately derived from the look of unfashionable and unwanted furniture. - A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing. The wheel is one of the main components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel and flywheel. - Wire drawing is a metalworking process used to reduce the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). There are many applications for wire drawing, including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, paper clips, spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. Although similar in process, drawing is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a cold working process, but it may be performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a versatile material with many uses, including writing, printing, packaging, cleaning, and a number of industrial and construction processes.

It was very easy to press the clay in order to make a wheel. The","completion":"villagers had been using this method for generations, and it was known to yield some of the most durable and long-lasting tools. Step 1: Gather the materials Before starting, I ensured that I had the necessary materials at hand – water, clay, and a wooden board to work on. The clay was sourced from the local riverbank, where the villagers believed it to have the perfect consistency for pottery making. Step 2: Knead the clay I began by kneading the clay to remove any air bubbles and achieve a uniform texture. This would ensure a smooth, balance, and strong wheel. It was important for the clay to be moist enough to work with but not too wet, which would cause cracking upon drying. Step 3: Shape the clay into a wheel Once the clay was prepared, I proceeded to shape it into a thick, round disc. I used the palms of my hands to flatten the clay while keeping it uniformly thick, checking for any cracks and ensuring that the edges were smooth and even. Step 4: Cut out the center I carefully measured and marked the center of the clay disc. Using a sharp-edged tool, I gently cut out the middle portion to create a hole for the wheel's axle, making sure the hole was large enough to accommodate the axle without compromising the wheel's structural integrity. Step 5: Refine the shape After cutting the center, I continued to refine the wheel's shape by smoothing out the edges, flattening any irregularities, and ensuring that the sides were as even as possible. This would ensure that the wheel would roll smoothly and reliably while in use. Step 6: Allow the wheel to dry Once I was satisfied with the shape, I placed the wheel in a dry, well-ventilated area to allow the water to evaporate from the clay. This process would take several days, and it was crucial to ensure the wheel was fully dried to prevent cracking while in use. Step 7: Firing the wheel When the wheel was dry, it was time for firing. This process would harden and solidify the clay, making it even more durable and long-lasting. The villagers had built a traditional wood-burning kiln where the wheel could be fired at a high temperature. Once the kiln reached the desired temperature, I carefully placed the wheel inside and let it fire for the appropriate amount of time, monitoring the temperature to ensure the wheel was properly fired. Step 8: Cool and inspect the wheel After the firing process was complete, I allowed the wheel to cool down gradually. Once it was cool enough to handle, I inspected the wheel for any cracks or imperfections caused during the firing process. To my satisfaction, the wheel turned out strong, smooth, and free from any defects. Step 9: Installing the wheel Finally, I brought the wheel back to the villagers, who celebrated its completion with much joy. The wheel was then installed onto the axle of a cart, and the villagers marveled at how smoothly and efficiently the new, handmade wheel performed. The age-old tradition of wheel-making was preserved, and the villagers were proud to continue this craft which had been passed down through generations. They recognized that their wheel-making skills, honed and perfected over time, were an integral part of their identity and a testament to the human spirit of innovation and adaptation. With every wheel crafted and every cart put to use, the villagers knew that they were keeping their ancestor's legacy alive."},{"prompt":"Q:For convenience some customers want things straight to the doorstep and use what?

Process: - Several types of gases form in the atmosphere - May come from different sources - The gases remain trapped in the atmosphere - Through the suns light the gases hold in heat and energy - Trap them in our atmosphere - The earth may become warmer this way. suppose Less gases remain trapped in the atmosphere happens, how will it affect a GREATER greenhouse effect. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"If less gases remain trapped in the atmosphere, it will directly affect the greenhouse effect by reducing its intensity. The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat and energy in the Earth's atmosphere. This leads to an increase in global temperatures, causing climate change and other environmental impacts. In the scenario where fewer greenhouse gases are trapped in the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect will be lessened, which means that less heat and energy will be retained in the atmosphere. This could potentially lead to a decrease in global temperatures, thus counteracting or mitigating some of the negative consequences associated with climate change. In this case, the perturbation is directly impacting a step of the process, as it influences the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and affects the primary mechanism through which the greenhouse effect occurs. By reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that are trapped in the atmosphere, the process of heat and energy retention is directly altered, impacting the overall intensity of the greenhouse effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Gory 'NeverDead' is one ridiculous romp After spending a few days playing Konami's \\"NeverDead,\\" I couldn't help but think video game makers are running out of ideas — or at least good ones. That's because the protagonist in this aptly-named game is an immortal demon hunter with a unique ability: He can be ripped apart and then must hop or roll around to reattach his body again. In fact, his rolling head can be used to solve puzzles, such as squeezing into tight spaces, before rejoining his torso and limbs when the job is done. Not only is this over-the-top Japanese-made adventure just ridiculous, the execution — if you can pardon the pun — is as faulty as the premise. The convoluted story starts 500 years ago when our hero Bryce Boltzmann is cursed with immortality by a bizarre demon king named Astaroth. Fast-forward to today and Boltzmann is a bitter mercenary-for-hire, who has watched his loved ones die for centuries. He exacts revenge by hunting demons — and makes some serious cash on the side, too. Boltzmann fights alongside a sexy female fighter, Arcadia — a mortal who can succumb to her injuries. Using a number of weapons including automatic machine guns and a katana sword, this third-person game has you shooting and slashing increasingly weird demons, solving a few environmental puzzles and unlocking new areas to continue the fight. Not only is Boltzmann unable to die, he can still survive without his head — er, unless it's eaten. While clearly campy, this game mechanic doesn't work well because just as you're frantically trying to regroup your body parts you're torn apart again by the vicious demons. This makes for a frustrating experience. It's too bad, because the swordplay can be quite fun at times. The right analog stick on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 controller moves your blade through the sharp-toothed enemies approaching you from all sides. The camera angles are also an issue as you can't always see your character clearly, or the body parts you need to find. Plus, the game tends to slow down when there's a lot of action onscreen at the same time. Boss fights are also problematic as many regain their health before you can finish them off. At times you won't know where to go next, unless Arcadia stares at a door and waits for you to figure it out; you're supposed to press down on the game controller's d-pad to get a hint on where to go next, but this only works about a quarter of the time. The indoor and outdoor environments are repetitive and unimaginatively designed. As you can see, there are some issues with the game, which offers both a single-player campaign and online options for both cooperative (co-op) and head-to-head play (again, pardon the pun). On one hand, the bloody and gory \\"NeverDead\\" is certainly unique thanks to its body dismemberment feature, but its numerous shortcomings — which could've been addressed with more time and polish — mean it's not worth your time or money. If you're intrigued by its silly premise and want to give it a spin, rent it for the weekend or wait until the game ends up in the bargain bin. It won't be long. Platform: Microsoft Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 Score: 2.0 stars (out of 4)","completion":"\\"NeverDead\\" is a video game with a funny story about an immortal demon hunter who can be ripped apart and then put himself back together again. He fights lots of weird demons with different weapons and solves puzzles with his body parts. But the game has some problems: it's hard to see what you're doing sometimes, it's confusing where to go, and the fighting can be difficult and annoying. Even though it has a strange and interesting idea, there are many issues with it and it's not very good. It's better to rent the game or wait for it to get cheaper before trying it out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Furthermore , the locations of zoos in urban areas leads to incidents like the fox attack at London Zoo in 2010 that killed 11 South African and Rockhopper penguins .","completion":"The debate topic that these sentences pertain to is the ethicality and justifiability of keeping animals in zoos. This topic examines whether zoos, as institutions that hold and display animals for public viewing, are morally defensible considering the negative impact they have on the physical and psychological well-being of the animals they house. The debate typically revolves around weighing the various pros and cons of zoos, including their potential educational, conservation, and research benefits against the issues of animal welfare and ethics. The sentences provided emphasize the concerns related to animal welfare in zoos: 1. The good intentions of zookeepers may not outweigh the suffering experienced by animals in zoos. 2. Animals in zoos are confined to small spaces and separated from the public by cages and bars, which may impact their natural behaviors and well-being. 3. Enclosures for large mammals like elephants are significantly smaller than their natural habitats, leading to restricted movement and unnatural living conditions. 4. Polar bears in zoos are confined to spaces that are a fraction of their natural territories in the Arctic, which poses issues for their natural behaviors and well-being. 5. Due to unnatural conditions and confinement, animals in zoos may suffer psychological distress, often displayed by abnormal or self-destructive behavior. 6. Aquatic animals may have insufficient water in their enclosures, and birds are prevented from flying by having their wings clipped and being confined to aviaries, suppressing their natural instincts and behaviors. 7. The urban locations of zoos can pose additional threats to the animals, such as predator attacks on zoo inhabitants (e.g., the fox attack at London Zoo in 2010 that killed several penguins). The debate on zoos raises questions about our responsibility towards animals, the necessity and effectiveness of zoos' conservation and education efforts, and whether the captivity of these creatures is justified in light of the physical and psychological distress they may experience. Those in favor of zoos argue for their importance in wildlife conservation, species preservation, and public education, while opponents emphasize the inherent cruelty and ethical dilemmas associated with confining animals and disrupting their natural lives for our benefit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific Andhrakavitapitamaha (lit, \\"father of Telugu poetry\\") and Tenali Ramakrishna, the court jester who authored several notable works.

Step 1: Identify the language of the text The text is indeed in Spanish. This is clear from recognizing common Spanish words and the grammatical structure of the sentences. Step 2: Determine the percentage of people who can read Spanish According to Ethnologue, there are approximately 460 million native Spanish speakers in the world, with additional people who speak it as a second or foreign language. The global population is approximately 7.8 billion. Step 3: Calculate the percentage of people who can read Spanish Assuming that only native Spanish speakers can read Spanish (which is not accurate, as there are also non-native speakers who can read it), we can create a rough estimation: (460 million / 7.8 billion) * 100 = 5.9%. This means that approximately 5.9% of the world's population are native Spanish speakers and would likely be able to read the text. Step 4: Determine the percentage of people who can't read Spanish Since the percentage of people who can read Spanish is estimated to be around 5.9%, the percentage who can't read Spanish would be the remaining proportion: 100% - 5.9% = 94.1% Conclusion: It is not accurate to say that \\"99% of people can't read this since it's in Spanish\\". A more appropriate estimation would be that approximately 94.1% of people can't read it due to it being in Spanish.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what kind of plant would shed its leaves each year?\\" is \\"grapevines\\", given that grapevines shed their leaves seasonally each year? Possible answers: (a). Yes; (b). No; Answer:","completion":"(a). Yes, I believe grapevines can indeed be considered an appropriate answer to the question \\"what kind of plant would shed its leaves each year?\\" as they are known to shed their leaves seasonally. Grapevines (Vitis spp.) are deciduous plants, which means they shed their leaves annually, usually during the autumn months. This seasonal leaf shedding is a natural part of the plant's life cycle as it prepares for dormancy during the winter. In response to changes in temperature, day length, and other environmental factors, grapevines experience physiological and biochemical changes that lead to leaf senescence and eventual leaf drop. The process of leaf shedding in grapevines occurs as follows: 1. As daylight hours decrease, chlorophyll production slows, causing leaves to change color from green to hues of yellow, orange, or red. 2. As leaves lose their chlorophyll, they become less capable of producing food for the plant through photosynthesis, eventually leading to leaf senescence. 3. During senescence, nutrients from the leaves are transported back into the main plant body to be stored and later used during the next growing season. 4. Abscission, the process of shedding leaves, occurs as a weakened abscission zone forms at the base of the petiole (the leaf stalk), which eventually causes the leaf to detach from the plant. While grapevines are not the only plants to undergo this process, they are an example of the type of plant that does. Deciduous plants, such as grapevines, shed their leaves annually as part of their life cycle, allowing them to conserve resources and tolerate harsh environmental conditions during winter. As such, grapevines are indeed an example of a plant that would shed its leaves each year, making \\"grapevines\\" the correct answer to the given question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Portuguese Restoration War was the name given by nineteenth-century Romantic historians to the war between Portugal and Spain that began with the Portuguese revolution of 1640 and ended with the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668.

The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, much of it occasioned by Spanish and Portuguese entanglements with non-Iberian powers.

Please answer the following question: Justin Nelson, Jr., pounded the last of the stakes of his new cattle pen into the dry dirt. Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions.

Usage: In the given task, you need to know the meaning of overruling in a legal context. For example, when a higher court nullifies a decision made by a lower court or the same court in a previous case, that's referred to as overruling. So, the first step is to have a clear understanding of this concept. Part #2: Analyzing the provided sentence. Usage: You should read and understand the given sentence. In this instance, the sentence is about differing interpretations of membership policies. Part #3: Determining whether the sentence is overruling or non-overruling. Usage: Once you understand the sentence, you need to identify whether it is overruling or non-overruling. In this case, the sentence refers to a debate concerning the rules of membership - it has nothing to do with overriding prior law or legal precedent. Thus, it would be classified as non-overruling. This meets the criteria because it's not talking about a newer law or decision that nullifies a previous case or decision. Part #4: Classifying the sentence. Usage: Mark your analysis either as overruling or non-overruling. In this example, the sentence will be marked as non-overruling because the sentence is debating membership policies, not overruling a legal precedent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One in three drivers is so clueless when it comes to road signs that they cannot even recognise the symbol for the national speed limit, a survey claims. A quarter of us are also unaware that blue motorway signs also explain the speed limit, while one in seven motorists mistakenly thought that 'slippery road' warning sign meant that the road had been freshly painted. Eight per cent of drivers admitted they were baffled by the common 'road narrowing' sign, while almost a fifth said they did not know that when driving in a built-up area the speed limit is 30mph unless signs say otherwise. The scale of ignorance was revealed in a survey of 2,000 drivers by car insurers More Than. The results also found that a 'worrying' proportion of drivers regularly ignore speed limits and drive as fast as they want to. More than a third (36 per cent) said they disregard 30mph limits, travelling at an avergae of 38mph, while 32 per cent said they break 47mph limits, going 47mph on average instead. On motorways, even more people admitted to ignoring the law, with 43 per cent breaking the 70mph in favour of an average speed of 81mph.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is endangered when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death-threatening postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill lurks around Kahane's home and is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi), whom he watches while talking to her on the phone, that Kahane is at a showing of 'The Bicycle Thief'. Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards. Kahane continues goading Mill about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot the two men fight. Mill loses his balance and falls, and feeling threatened, kills Kahane, then makes the death look like a robbery gone wrong.The next day, Mill receives another postcard. Mill attends Kahanes funeral and gets along with June; she knows none of the other mourners. Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive.

She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling... The answer is:","completion":"The first name of the person is not provided in the given text. However, it is mentioned that the person who probably appears before a donor is Mary, who is also given three roles in the painting: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans,\\" and Queen of Heaven."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: John is trying to figure out how the shape of an object affects how it reacts with other elements. For that, he chose two objects, both made of the same element - object A and object B. Object A has a larger surface area, but object B has smaller surface area. He let these objects to react with other reactants to see how the processes work. But I can use this background: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. What is an answer for this question: Would object A be more or less exposed to the reactants than object B?","completion":"Based on the provided background information, it is clear that the surface area of a solid object plays a significant role in determining how effectively it can react with other elements because only the matter at the surface of the solid can interact with the reactants. In the situation you mentioned, John has chosen two objects, object A and object B. Both of these objects are made of the same element, but object A has a larger surface area, while object B has a smaller surface area. Consequently, the reaction rate of these two solid objects should be directly influenced by the differences in their surface areas. In line with this understanding, object A would be more exposed to the reactants than object B, as its larger surface area allows it to have more contact points available for interaction with the surrounding reactants. This increased exposure would consequently result in a higher reaction rate for object A than for object B, given the identical nature of the elements they are made of. An analogy to this concept can be seen in the example of the hammer and nails. Both the hammer and nails are made of iron, but the nails have a larger surface area relative to their volume, which exposes more of their material to the surrounding oxygen and consequently accelerates the rusting process compared to the hammer. Similarly, the increased surface area of object A exposes more of its material to the reactants surrounding it, facilitating a faster reaction process than the reaction involving object B. In conclusion, object A will be more exposed to the reactants than object B as it has a larger surface area, which increases the number of contact points available for interaction with other elements. This, in turn, results in object A potentially experiencing a higher reaction rate compared to object B, assuming all other factors remain constant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Robert Wilson \\"Robb\\" Royer (born December 6, 1942 in Los Angeles, California) is an American musician and songwriter, best known as a founding member of Bread from 1968 to 1971. While he was with the band, they had a #5 UK/#1 US hit single with \\"Make It With You\\". He was replaced by Larry Knechtel in 1971. Context: In 1982 Royer wrote the song \\"Quittin' Time\\" (co-written with Roger Linn) which eight years later was recorded by Mary Chapin Carpenter and won an ASCAP Airplay award. Royer traveled to Nashville to receive the award and stayed with Griffin, who had previously relocated from L.A. to Nashville. Larry Knechtel had also been living and working as a session musician in Nashville. Royer relocated to Nashville in 1994. Todd Cerney was already a grammy-nominated songwriter when Royer met him in 1994 at Jim Della Croce's house. Cerney had written two top-forty songs (Loverboy's \\"Notorious\\" and Restless Heart's \\"I'll Still Be Loving You,\\" which reached number one on the Country charts). Cerney had established a private recording studio in his home where he engineered a number of other singer-songwriters' albums. Griffin, Royer and Cerney first collaborated by co-writing the song \\"Kyrie\\" in 1994. Knechtel later joined the trio and together they performed and co-wrote songs (including the 1995 song \\"Slow Train\\") under the band name \\"Toast\\". Toast performed at various Nashville venues including the Bluebird, Third and Lindsley, and 12th & Porter. They wrote and performed their own songs including such titles as \\"Road Kill,\\" \\"Knechtelodeon,\\" \\"No More Smokin',\\" \\"Grenadine,\\" \\"Magdelena,\\" and \\"Radio Dixie.\\" The group used session drummers for their recordings and performances. The group would later be known as Radio Dixie in 1998. The name change was intended to help with promotion of the group, but the group disbanded by the end of 1998.

The astronauts had powered up their space-craft and were awaiting word from Mission Control to fire their breaking rockets and head for home when controllers announced early Monday that low clouds over Cape Canaveral would postpone the landing. When cloud cover still threatened after the second of two landing opportunities, NASA officials rescheduled the landing for Tuesday, when they would consider two alternative landing sites in addition to Florida'sKennedySpaceCenter. Before the weather _ , Discovery had been set to land before dawn. Its return to the earth would have concluded the first shuttle flight sinceColumbiadisintegrated while re-entering the earth's atmosphere 21/2 years ago. Discovery's 13-day flight to the international space station may be the last one for a long while. NASA grounded the shuttle fleet after a slab of insulating foam broke off Discovery's external fuel tank during liftoff---the very thing that doomed(...) Columbia and was supposed to have been corrected. Discovery was the first shuttle to visit the station since 2002.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The World Health Organization (WHO) planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease. Two doctors were chosen to make the study. They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries. They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa. The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor. The diseased children are usually from one to four years old. As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body. The skin changes color and may break out in open sores . The hair changes color and starts to fall out. The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time. Stomach liquids are no longer produced. The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat. Their mothers, after stopping their breastfeeding, gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins. They found that the addition of milk to the food of the children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives. The unbelievable thing about kwashiorkor is that the very existence of the disease--which has been killing thousands of children for centuries--was not even recognized in Latin America as recently as ten years ago. The deaths of those children were mistakenly listed as due to other diseases. It was the WHO's work in Africa that led to the discovery of the problem in Central America.

And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up. Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products. Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power. Both companies strive to be more efficient and to pollute less. Which company made less fuel for trucks? Answer:","completion":"Company H made less fuel for trucks.

Case B: Induction Induction, on the other hand, refers to the transfer of charge or energy without direct physical contact between the objects. In this case, the two objects do not need to be touching each other for charge to occur, but rather, they can be situated a certain distance apart from one another.

Given the question: The city of Lampo is currently experiencing some soil piping in the ground. The government officials of Lampo are currently looking to start a casino to bring in extra revenue to the town. They are currently consulting with a company that is located in Himpton, a city that is not experiencing soil piping. The company is a well respected leader in the casino industry and is eager to work with Lampo. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Are sink holes more or less likely to form in Lampo? Hint: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. The answer is:","completion":"Sink holes are more likely to form in Lampo. Step-by-step justification: 1. The question asks about the likelihood of sink holes forming in Lampo. 2. The paragraph provides information about the situation in Lampo, including the fact that it is experiencing soil piping. 3. The definition of soil piping, as mentioned in the hint, states that it is a form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface and causes sink hole formation, among other issues. 4. Since Lampo is currently experiencing soil piping, and soil piping causes sink hole formation, it is reasonable to deduce that sink holes are more likely to form in the city of Lampo."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To properly assess the presence and size of waterfalls in the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas, we must consider additional information on the region's natural landscape and geological features. The Ozark Mountains, also known as the Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic region in the United States that covers parts of Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The region is characterized by its unique geomorphology, consisting of plateaus, deep valleys, rivers, and springs. It is common for such geological formations to create waterfalls as water flows from higher elevations to lower ones, causing the erosion of soft rock layers and creating steep drops. Some of the river systems in the Ozarks, including the Buffalo National River, contain picturesque waterfalls. Northwestern Arkansas, where the Arkansas Mountain AVA is located, is a part of the Boston Mountains, which are the highest and most rugged portion of the Ozarks. The region is abundant in water resources due to the presence of numerous rivers, such as the Buffalo, Mulberry, and Kings rivers, as well as many smaller creeks and tributaries. These rivers and streams give rise to numerous waterfalls throughout the area, some of which are well-known, such as Triple Falls, Glory Hole, and Hemmed-in Hollow Falls. There are also many lesser-known, smaller waterfalls scattered throughout the region. Given the information regarding the landscape features of the Ozark Mountains, particularly the presence of many rivers, creeks, and tributaries, in addition to the region's rugged terrain in the Boston Mountains of northwestern Arkansas, we can conclude that the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas possess a significant number of waterfalls. However, the provided data about the Arkansas Mountain AVA does not directly relate to the conclusion, as the AVA's focus is mainly on viticulture, not the presence or size of waterfalls. In summary, though the information provided about the Arkansas Mountain AVA does not directly address or support the conclusion, additional information about the Ozark Mountains' geology and hydrology does indicate that there are numerous waterfalls in the area. However, the sizes of the waterfalls may vary, ranging from large, well-known ones to smaller, less celebrated cascades."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The premise given is: \\"No, Mr. White.\\" This statement indicates a denial, refusal, or disagreement with something related to an individual referred to as Mr. White. However, the statement does not provide ample context or information. It is unclear what is being denied or to what aspects of Mr. White's situation the remark is referring. On the other hand, the hypothesis provided is: \\"The man's last name was White.\\" This hypothesis is a statement about a specific individual, asserting that he has the last name 'White.' To conclude whether the hypothesis is true or not based on the given premise, we need to see if there is a logical connection between the two of them. If we analyze the premise and hypothesis, we can see that both statements involve someone with the last name 'White.' The premise directly refers to a person called 'Mr. White,' while the hypothesis states that a man has the last name 'White.' However, the initial statement that says, \\"No, Mr. White\\" only provides a negative response or denial to an unknown request or action involving someone named Mr. White, and does not give any information about the man's identity or personal information. It does not confirm, nor deny, the hypothesis directly. Based on this analysis, we cannot firmly conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well. The premise, while involving a person named Mr. White, does not give any specific information about the man or his last name, and therefore, cannot be used to definitively support or disprove the hypothesis. We would need more context and information in order to draw a stronger connection between the premise and hypothesis for a valid conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Objective: How to Make a Non Toxic Wood Furniture Polish Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, I will outline both the solutions and discuss the naive physics reasoning behind them. After assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each solution, it will be easier to determine which one is more sound. Solution 1: A Homemade Olive Oil and Lemon Furniture Polish Ingredients: - 1 cup of olive oil - 1/4 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice Procedure: 1. Mix the olive oil and lemon juice in a glass jar or a spray bottle. 2. Shake the container well to combine the ingredients, as the oil and lemon juice are immiscible liquids and may separate. 3. Apply a small amount of the polish to a clean, soft cloth or microfiber cloth. 4. Gently rub the cloth onto the wood furniture in circular motions, working on small sections at a time. 5. Allow the polish to absorb into the wood for a few minutes, then buff with a clean cloth to reveal a natural shine. 6. Store the remaining polish in a cool, dark place for future use. Naive Physics Reasoning: This solution uses olive oil, a natural substance with conditioning properties that nourish and protect the wood. The lemon juice adds a light, fresh scent and provides mild cleaning properties that help remove surface dirt. Together, these ingredients create a simple yet effective non-toxic wood furniture polish that gives a natural shine without causing damage to the wood or leaving harmful chemical residues. Solution 2: A Homemade Beeswax and Coconut Oil Furniture Polish Ingredients: - 1/4 cup of beeswax pellets or grated beeswax - 3/4 cup of coconut oil Procedure: 1. In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, melt the beeswax. Be sure not to let the water come into direct contact with the beeswax. 2. Once the beeswax has melted, add the coconut oil. Stir gently until the coconut oil has melted and combined with the beeswax. 3. Remove the mixture from heat and let it cool slightly. Pour the liquid into a glass jar and allow it to solidify. Once cooled, it will form a thick paste. 4. To use, apply a small amount of the polish with a clean, soft cloth, working in circular motions and covering small sections of the wood at a time. 5. Allow the polish to absorb into the wood for about 30 minutes. 6. Buff the surface of the furniture with a clean cloth to remove any excess polish and reveal a protective, natural shine. Naive Physics Reasoning: This solution uses beeswax and coconut oil, both natural substances that have conditioning and protective properties. Beeswax helps seal and protect the wood, while coconut oil nourishes and moisturizes the surface. The combination of these two ingredients creates a highly effective non-toxic wood furniture polish that provides long-lasting protection and a lustrous shine without exposing the wood or the user to harmful chemicals. Conclusion: Based on naive physics reasoning, both solutions can effectively polish and protect wood furniture without using toxic chemicals. However, the beeswax and coconut oil furniture polish (Solution 2) seems to be a more sound solution, as it provides a long-lasting protective barrier and a more durable shine. The olive oil and lemon polish (Solution 1) may require more frequent applications due to the quick-absorbing nature of olive oil and the mild cleaning action of lemon juice. Ultimately, both solutions are non-toxic and suitable for maintaining wood furniture, but Solution 2 is preferred for its sturdiness and extended protective qualities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"Bribing someone is an unethical and generally illegal act, and I do not condone or support it. Instead, I encourage you to approach situations in a fair, honest, and transparent manner. However, I can provide you with information on how to influence and persuade someone ethically and professionally. Here is a detailed outline of ethical persuasion techniques: 1. Build rapport: Establishing a connection and trust with the person you want to influence is key. Be genuinely interested in their perspective, empathetic towards their concerns, and respectful of their opinions. 2. Understand their needs and motivations: Invest time in learning about the person's goals, aspirations, and values. This allows you to present your ideas or requests in a way that aligns with their interests and addresses their concerns effectively. 3. Use effective communication skills: Be clear, concise, and articulate when presenting your ideas. Use evidence, anecdotes, or examples to back up your claims and create a compelling argument. Additionally, use open questions that encourage dialogue, allowing you to even understand and address any objections they might have. 4. Demonstrate credibility: Show your knowledge, expertise, and reliability in the subject matter you're discussing. This can be done by providing facts, statistics, or examples that substantiate your point while also displaying your passion and commitment to the issue. 5. Appeal to emotions: As humans, we are often driven by our emotions. Understand the emotional aspects of your case and evoke feelings such as empathy, pride, or urgency. Connect your argument to their core values and beliefs to create a stronger impact. 6. Create a sense of urgency: People are more likely to act if they perceive a time constraint or fear missing out on a valuable opportunity. Emphasize the importance of acting now or outline the potential consequences of inaction. 7. Offer solutions: People are more likely to buy into your idea if you provide them with a viable solution to their problem. Present the benefits of your suggestion clearly and emphasize how it would improve their current situation. 8. Reach a consensus: Find common ground and emphasize points of agreement. Make the person feel like they are part of the decision-making process by encouraging collaboration and shared ownership of the idea or project. 9. Practice patience: Persuasion takes time and effort. Be prepared to engage in multiple conversations or meetings before you secure a commitment. Remain persistent, confident, and open to feedback throughout the process. By applying these ethical persuasion techniques, you can build strong relationships and achieve desired outcomes without resorting to bribery or any other form of unethical behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fruit, which is formed by the enlargement of flower parts, is frequently a seed-dispersal tool that attracts animals to eat or otherwise disturb it, incidentally scattering the seeds it contains (see frugivory). Although many such mutualistic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition and to spread widely, flowering proved to be an unusually effective means of reproduction, spreading (whatever its origin) to become the dominant form of land plant life. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did mutualistic relationships spread to eventually become?","completion":"Mutualistic relationships, through the process of seed dispersal by animals consuming fruits, eventually spread to become the dominant form of land plant life. This essentially means that plants managed to use animals to their advantage, ensuring their seeds were spread further and more efficiently. In biology, mutualism is the way two organisms of different species exist in a relationship in which each individual benefits. In this case, the plant and the animal constitute the two organisms. The plant benefits by having its seeds dispersed over a wide area, resulting in higher chances of continual survival and proliferation of its species. The animal, on the other hand, benefits from the food resource which is the fruit or flower part. Hence, creating a symbiotic relationship that benefits both parties. Flowering proved to be a notably efficient means of reproduction which eventually led to this form of mutualism. Through gradual ecological changes and evolution, flowering plants — also known as angiosperms, developed a trait that helps in attracting animals, which is their fleshy, nutritious fruits. When beings like birds, insects, or mammals consume these fruits, they inadvertently help in the transportation of seeds. The movement of animals, whether through flying, walking, or other means, allows the seeds to be dispersed in many different locations, sometimes quite far from the parent plant. If the consumed seeds aren't fully digested and can remain viable after passage through the digestive tract of the animal, they can potentially germinate and grow in the new location when excreted. Over time, the spreading of this mutualistic relationship between plants and animals became more widespread and eventually resulted in such angiosperms becoming the dominant form of land plant life. This innovative means of seed dispersal has allowed flowering plants to colonize a vast array of environments and niches across the globe more effectively than other plant groups. This global pervasiveness of angiosperms is a testimony to the overwhelming success of these mutualistic relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Olmecs were the earliest known major civilization in Mexico following a progressive development in Soconusco. They lived in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, in the present-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco. It has been speculated that the Olmecs derive in part from neighboring Mokaya or Mixe-Zoque. The Olmecs flourished during Mesoamerica's formative period, dating roughly from as early as 1500 BCE to about 400 BCE. Pre- While the actual ethno-linguistic affiliation of the Olmec remains unknown, various hypotheses have been put forward. For example, in 1968 Michael D. Coe speculated that the Olmec were Mayan predecessors. In 1976, linguists Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman published a paper in which they argued a core number of loanwords had apparently spread from a Mixe-Zoquean language into many other Mesoamerican languages. Campbell and Kaufman proposed that the presence of these core loanwords indicated that the Olmec - generally regarded as the first \\"highly civilized\\" Mesoamerican society - spoke a language ancestral to Mixe-Zoquean. The spread of this vocabulary particular to their culture accompanied the diffusion of other Olmec cultural and artistic traits that appears in the archaeological record of other Mesoamerican societies. Mixe-Zoque specialist Soren Wichmann first critiqued this theory on the basis that most of the Mixe-Zoquean loans seemed to originate only from the Zoquean branch of the family. This implied the loanword transmission occurred in the period after the two branches of the language family split, placing the time of the borrowings outside of the Olmec period. However, new evidence has pushed back the proposed date for the split of Mixean and Zoquean languages to a period within the Olmec era. Based on this dating, the architectural and archaeological patterns and the particulars of the vocabulary loaned to other Mesoamerican languages from Mixe-Zoquean, Wichmann now suggests that the Olmecs of San Lorenzo spoke proto-Mixe and the Olmecs of La Venta spoke proto-Zoque. At least the fact that the Mixe-Zoquean languages are still spoken in an area corresponding roughly to the Olmec heartland, and are historically known to have been spoken there, leads most scholars to assume that the Olmec spoke one or more Mixe-Zoquean languages. were their any other languages?","completion":"Yes, there is a possibility that the Olmecs were exposed to or spoke other languages besides the Mixe-Zoquean languages. Mesoamerica was a culturally and linguistically diverse region, with multiple ethnic groups and languages coexisting and interacting throughout its history. Although Mixe-Zoquean languages are the most likely candidates for the Olmec's primary language based on current evidence, it is important to note that the Olmecs had extensive trade networks and interactions with various neighboring cultures and civilizations, such as the Maya, the Zapotec, and the Teotihuacan. This exposure to multiple cultures could have led to a multilingual environment where multiple languages were spoken and understood by the Olmec people. For example, the presence of Mayan inscriptions and iconography in some Olmec sites suggests that some Olmecs might have known or had some understanding of the Mayan language. Similarly, there must have been some level of communication between the Olmecs and their trading partners from distant regions, which could have necessitated the use of other languages or the development of a pidgin or trading language. Moreover, the Olmec civilization has often been dubbed \\"the mother culture\\" of Mesoamerica, as many later civilizations borrowed or adopted various elements of Olmec culture, religion, and iconography. This cultural exchange also implies a certain degree of linguistic interaction and exchange between the Olmecs and other Mesoamerican groups. In summary, while the prevailing hypothesis suggests that the Olmecs spoke Mixe-Zoquean languages, it is likely that they were also familiar with or spoke other languages due to their extensive trade networks, interactions with neighboring cultures, and the borrowing of Olmec cultural elements by later civilizations. Further archaeological and linguistic research may shed more light on the full extent of the Olmec's linguistic diversity and interactions with other Mesoamerican languages."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Beswick's mummified body was initially kept at Ancoats Hall, the home of another Beswick family member, but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White's home in Sale, Manchester, where it was stored in an old clock case. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity; the author Thomas de Quincey was one of those who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as \\"one of the most remarkable objects in the museum\\". The \\"cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century\\", according to writer Edith Sitwell.There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick. One of the few contemporary accounts of her is provided by Philip Wentworth, a local historian: The body was well preserved but the face was shrivelled and black. The legs and trunks were tightly bound in a strong cloth such as is used for bed ticks [a stiff kind of mattress cover material] and the body, which was that of a little old woman, was in a glass coffin-shaped case. Shortly after the museum's transfer to Manchester University in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was \\"irrevocably and unmistakably dead\\", the time had come for her to be buried. But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a certificate of death before a burial could take place; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State, who issued an order for her burial. With the permission of the Bishop of Manchester, Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death.

People's perception of boredom or excitement can depend on personal preferences, background, and interests. Given the choices provided, the most appropriate answer would be: b) It is not possible to tell. While your statement indicates that you personally find Kansas boring and are glad to have left, other people might have different viewpoints and experiences. For some, Kansas might offer quiet charm, with a slower pace of life and rich agricultural heritage that they might find enjoyable and fulfilling. Moreover, boredom and excitement can be influenced by multiple factors such as hobbies, social interactions, available activities, and personal growth. It is important to consider these aspects when evaluating an individual's satisfaction or boredom in a particular location. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively determine whether leaving Kansas would have prevented boredom for everyone or whether remaining in Kansas would have led to being \\"bored to death.\\" In conclusion, personal preferences and experiences vary greatly, and what might be considered boring for one person could be enjoyable or meaningful for another. Thus, it is crucial to recognize the diversity of opinions, interests, and lifestyles when discussing the subject of boredom and excitement in relation to a specific location such as Kansas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. Joe is at a party and carrying around a can of beer that he has had in his hand for awhile. He bumps into Sally, and they begin chatting. During their conversation, Sally notices the beer in Joe's hand, and remarks that a beer sounds like a good idea. She heads over to the refrigerator and grabs a nice cold one and pops it open. She takes a sip while the two continue their chat. Which person's beer has molecules farther apart? A:","completion":"A: To determine whose beer has molecules farther apart, we need to consider the temperatures of each beer. 1. Joe has been holding his beer for a while, so it's expected that his beer has become warmer due to the heat transfer from his hand. 2. Sally just got her beer from the refrigerator, so it's likely colder than Joe's beer. 3. As water (and by extension, beer) cools down, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another, increasing its density. This continues until it reaches its highest density at about 4°C. Conversely, as it warms up, the molecules move farther apart and the density decreases. 4. Based on this information, Joe's beer is warmer and therefore has molecules farther apart compared to Sally's colder beer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a text based on this summary: cooperation in eu plan against terrorism may be difficult to achieve Text:","completion":"Once upon a time, there was a big family called the European Union, or EU for short. They lived together in a beautiful land with lots of countries. They loved playing together and sharing things with each other. One day, they decided that they needed a plan to protect all the countries from some naughty people who wanted to do bad things, like break their toys or even hurt them. They called this plan \\"Fighting against Terrorism\\". But, it was challenging for all the countries of the big family to agree on how to make a perfect plan because each of them had different ideas and ways of doing things. So, everyone in the EU family had to learn to listen carefully, understand each other better, and work together as a team. Only then, they can make a super-duper plan to keep their land safe from the naughty people who want to do bad things. And they all knew that they could do it if they try their best to cooperate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: There are several different kinds of patents available and a recipe could fall into more than one category of patents. The Utility Patent protects new inventions that have a useful application. This covers new methods, processes, machines, manufactured items, devices or chemical compounds or any new improvements to any of these. Most recipes would fall under the Utility Patent category. The product shape or packaging may also be susceptible to protection under a design patent. In this case you could apply for one of those as well. Patents can be filed either in the United States or in other countries. If you feel that your recipe requires international protection, then you should apply for a patent in countries where you want patent protection. The European Union offers a \\"European Patent Office\\" that facilitates patent applications for countries within the EU. There are patent lawyers who specialize in filing the necessary paperwork with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. While you're certainly allowed to submit your own paperwork, the patent office recommends you hire a lawyer at this point to handle the flow of paperwork and make sure you submit all the required materials. Regardless of who does the actual filing, the papers are then submitted electronically to the patent office. The application cover sheet and list of required attachments can be obtained from the United States Patent and Trademark Office website, at uspto.gov. The patent application should be filed either online or via regular mail (note that filing online will allow you to avoid the 400 \\"non-electronic filing\\" surcharge and speed up the process considerably). The US patent office will consider your paperwork and make a determination if your recipe is eligible for a patent. If you're approved, the patent office will contact you. After you pay an issue and publication fee, your patent will be granted. The vast majority of patent applications are routinely rejected. You should not take it personally. Examiners are required to enforce the rules diligently and it often works out to your advantage, resulting in a more valuable patent. If your application is rejected you have an opportunity to argue or to amend (narrow) the claims or to appeal the examiners' final decision. This often takes several years and thousands of dollars in filing fees and attorneys' fees. If your application is finally rejected and you abandon it, and you still want to protect your recipe, you can do so by protecting it as a trade secret. Those who know the secret will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and in this way you can prevent your recipe from getting leaked.","completion":"This article talks about patents, which are like special papers that protect people's new inventions or ideas. Recipes can get patents too, so no one else copies them. There are different types of patents, and a recipe might fit into more than one group. A Utility Patent is the most common for recipes. Sometimes, the shape or packaging of a product can also get a Design Patent. People can apply for patents in the United States or in other countries. If they want their recipe to be safe in many places, they should apply in each country they want protection. There's a special place called the \\"European Patent Office\\" that helps with patents in Europe. People can do the papers by themselves or get help from a special lawyer, but it's better to hire one. Once everything is ready, the papers have to be sent to the patent office electronically. This must be done either online or by regular mail, but doing it online is faster and avoids extra costs. The patent office checks all the papers and decides if the recipe can have a patent. If they agree, the person has to pay some fees, and the patent is given. Sometimes patents get rejected, but it's not personal. If it's refused, people can change some things or argue, but it takes time and money. If, in the end, they can't get a patent, they can still protect their recipe by calling it a \\"trade secret.\\" That means only those who know it have to promise not to tell anyone else about it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question: Joe's urine was almost clear; its water content was probably high or low? Answer:","completion":"Joe's urine being almost clear is an indication that its water content is high. The color of urine is determined by the amount of water that is excreted along with various waste products and chemicals. A well-hydrated person typically produces clear or pale yellow urine, which indicates that the water content in the urine is high. This means that Joe's body is efficiently processing and eliminating waste products while maintaining a healthy balance of water and electrolytes. The process of urine formation takes place in the kidneys, where blood is constantly filtered, and waste products, excess salts, and water are removed. Urine is primarily composed of water (about 95%), and the remaining 5% consists of waste products such as urea, creatinine, and various salts and ions. When the body is well-hydrated, the kidneys receive sufficient water to dilute these waste products, resulting in lighter-colored urine. On the other hand, darker-colored urine indicates that the water content in the urine is low. This usually means that the body is not receiving enough water, and as a result, the waste products are more concentrated in the urine. Dehydration, certain medications, and some medical conditions can all contribute to darker-colored urine. Dark yellow to amber-colored urine can indicate mild to severe dehydration, and it is essential to increase water intake in such cases. In summary, Joe's almost clear urine suggests that its water content is high, and his body is effectively eliminating waste products while maintaining optimal hydration levels. A healthy urine color is generally light yellow to clear, and it is essential to monitor urine color as an indicator of hydration status and overall health. Drinking an adequate amount of water every day, as per individual needs, is crucial for maintaining good kidney function and promoting overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton called Republican rival Donald Trump dangerous and unqualified for the presidency in a blistering foreign policy speech Thursday in San Diego, California. \\"He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,\\" Clinton said. \\"This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes.\\" Trump “doesn’t understand America, or the world,” she said. \\"It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.\\" In anticipation of the address, Trump attacked his Democratic opponent on Twitter. “Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin’ Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions,” he tweeted. Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. “National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA. With polls show terrorism is a major concern among Americans, Clinton targeted Trump's positions on the issue. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders. \\"The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies,\\" Trump said in a foreign policy speech in April. Trump's other anti-terrorism proposals include a pledge to torture and murder the families of suspected terrorists and target Islamic State. \\"I have a simple message for them,\\" Trump said. \\"Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. But they will be gone. And soon.\\" But... Question: when will immigration policy change?

Translate to English","completion":"I believe that the relevant regulations should provide guidance to officials on how they should ensure both sound financial management and good administration. In order to achieve and maintain both sound financial management and good administration in an organization, it is essential that relevant policies and regulations are implemented, providing officials with clear and comprehensive guidance. These regulations should be designed with the goal of ensuring transparency, efficiency, and accountability. 1. Transparency: A key aspect of financial management and good administration is transparency, meaning that all financial transactions and decision-making processes are open, accessible, and easily understood by all stakeholders. To encourage transparency, officials should be required to maintain accurate and up-to-date records of financial transactions, and to make these records available for regular audits and public scrutiny. 2. Efficiency: Effective use of resources can maximize the impact of an organization's budget and prevent wastage. Regulations should encourage officials to engage in efficient practices, such as cost-benefit analysis, prioritizing projects with the highest potential impact, and consistently monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of their actions. 3. Accountability: To ensure a high level of accountability for financial management and administrative decisions, regulations should set clear expectations of conduct for officials and provide mechanisms for enforcement. These may include detailed performance indicators, ongoing performance reviews, and designated channels for reporting misconduct when it occurs. 4. Education and Training: Regulations should also emphasize the need for ongoing education and training for all officials involved in financial management and administration. This will ensure that they remain up-to-date with best practices, and are equipped to make informed and responsible decisions. 5. Collaboration and Communication: Effective communication and collaboration between officials and various stakeholders, including colleagues, external partners, and the public, is crucial for good administration. Regulations should encourage open lines of communication and support collaboration among various actors to achieve the organization's objectives. 6. Risk Management: In order to protect the organization and its financial assets, it is essential to have a robust risk management process in place. Regulations should outline requirements for risk assessment, risk mitigation strategies, and contingency planning. 7. Performance Measurement: Regularly measuring and assessing the performance of financial management and administrative processes helps identify areas for improvement, and ensures that the organization is on track to achieve its goals. Regulations should establish performance metrics, evaluation processes, and reporting requirements for officials. By implementing and adhering to these principles, relevant regulations can provide a solid foundation for officials to ensure sound financial management and good administration within their organization.

Let's talk about six easy ways to clean them up, so keep reading and try these steps with the help of an adult. 1. Blot excess ink immediately: When you spill ink, the first thing you must do is to take a paper towel or a clean cloth and gently press it on the ink stain. Don't rub it, or the ink might spread. Just lightly dab so it can soak up the extra ink. Ask an adult to assist you! 2. Try isopropyl rubbing alcohol: Isopropyl rubbing alcohol is a special liquid that you can find at home with your parents' help. It's like a helper that makes ink disappear. Dip a cotton ball or a soft cloth in the rubbing alcohol and gently dab it on the ink stain. Watch the ink magically dissolve! 3. Consider using vinegar on the ink stain: Vinegar is another special cleaning agent that can help remove ink stains. Mix some white vinegar with cornstarch to make a thick, gooey paste. With your parent's help, spread the paste over the ink stain and let it dry. Later, you can brush off the paste, and the ink will be gone. Amazing, right? 4. Try hairspray: Did you know that hairspray can help remove ink stains too? With the help of an adult, spray some hairspray on the stain, leave it there for a few moments, and then dab it with a clean cloth. You'll see that the ink starts disappearing. 5. Try a commercial stain remover: There are special cleaning products, like stain removers, that your parent or guardian can buy from a store. These are like superheroes fighting against ink villains! Ask an adult to help you apply the stain remover on the ink stain, follow the instructions written on the bottle, and watch the stain go away. 6. Rinse the area thoroughly with clean water: After you've tried one of these cleaning methods, it's important to clean the area with water to remove any leftover cleaner. Gently rinse the area with cool, clean water and pat it dry with a clean cloth or paper towel. Remember, you might have to try these steps more than once to make the ink stain go away completely. Always ask for an adult's help while trying these cleaning methods, and soon enough, the ink stain will disappear as if it was never there! Happy cleaning!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The atmosphere is lively and filled with anticipation, as a prominent ship is about to embark on a long and perilous journey across the vast and dangerous ocean. A young sailor named Johanna, who recently joined the crew, is secretly a woman disguised as a man. She has been searching for answers about her true identity after discovering a mysterious letter amongst her late father's belongings. The letter hinted at a dark family secret, a past entwined with the legendary and feared \\"Siren of the Sea.\\" Unbeknownst to the crew, Johanna is a descendant of this mystical figure. Facing a lifetime of prejudice and judgement, she assumes a male identity to pursue her quest for the truth about her heritage—defying the societal expectations of her time and risking her own safety. Act II: As the ship embarks on its journey, the intricate web of relationships amongst the crew members begins to unravel. Johanna's resourcefulness and incredible seamanship skills catch the eye of the gruff, yet wise ship captain, Captain Victor Grey. He takes Johanna under his wing and becomes her mentor. Throughout the voyage, the crew encounters both treacherous storms and marine creatures of fierce wonder as they navigate through the open ocean. Johanna becomes close friends with a fellow young sailor named Thomas, a kind-hearted dreamer with a penchant for storytelling. Johanna, driven by her desire to uncover the truth and inspired by her friendships, begins to trust those around her more openly. One stormy night, the ship gets caught in a whirlpool, which leads them to the hidden and mystical \\"Siren's Cove\\"—a place forgotten by time and cloaked in mystery. Here, the crew encounters strange and otherworldly beings with powerful siren-like qualities. Among these beings is a wise and ancient siren named Orenda, who reveals the truth of Johanna's heritage and helps her understand the nature of her unique abilities. Act III: As they set to leave the Siren's Cove, disaster strikes when a notorious pirate ship, captained by the ruthless Black Anne, attacks them. A fierce battle ensues, and Johanna's true identity is revealed during the conflict. Captain Grey is gravely injured, and it's up to Johanna to harness her newfound powers to save the crew and defeat the pirate threat. Johanna is embraced by the crew for her courage and sacrifices, but she knows that returning to Portside Landing would mean a return to the life of oppression and judgment she sought to escape. She voluntarily hands over the captain's hat to Thomas. In a heartfelt farewell, Johanna decides to stay behind in the Siren's Cove, where she can continue to unravel her past and explore the limits of her powers. Thomas, now in charge of the ship, leads the remaining crew back to their home, where they vow to keep Johanna's secret and honor her memory as a brave and loyal sailor. The film closes with the crew of the ship, now bonded by their experiences, sailing toward the horizon—with Johanna's spirit forever in their hearts. Throughout the film, Johanna's journey and persistence in following her own path, despite all the odds against her, remind the viewer of the importance of remaining true to oneself, even in the face of tremendous adversity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Should McDonald's Give Charles Ramsey A Reward For Heroism? Just what is McDonald's McDonald's trying to accomplish by involving itself in the horrible story of three young women held captive for over a decade in a Cleveland house? The fast-food behemoth says it wants to get in touch with Charles Ramsey, the heroic neighbor who kicked apart a door to free Amanda Berry, helped her call 911, and then gave a vivid, witty, and ultimately viral account of what happened to a local TV reporter. Explaining his sudden acts of heroism, Ramsey noted that he was “eating my McDonald’s” when he heard shouting from his neighbor’s house and sprang into action. McDonald’s came up in the 911 call too. McDonald’s says it is responding to an outpouring of social media requests that it honor or reward Ramsey somehow. Well, OK. But really, it’s the most tenuous of connections. Had Ramsey been eating a kruller from Dunkin’ Donuts, texting on a Samsung phone, or playing an XBox game (or all of those things) at the time Berry started yelling for help, would those respective corporations be expected to queue up to laud him? This is treacherous territory, because McDonald’s cannot be seen as capitalizing on a series of terrible crimes. And yet, it’s not really clear it can completely avoid that. Basking in the reflected light of Ramsey’s heroism may be one step removed, but one step removed is still pretty damn close. There are also issues of class lurking underneath the surface here, given the nexus of cheap-tasty-unhealthy fast food and the public health problems that lower-income communities face. Food corporations are desperate to promote public health and lighten up their menus. Giving Charles Ramsey a lifetime supply of Big Macs helps no one. But giving him a lifetime supply of Fruit and Walnut Salads might be seen as opportunistic or patronizing. (Unless he happens to really, really like McDonald’s Fruit and Walnut Salads.) And during a time when corporations are taking on more quasi-public functions, from slapping their names on stadiums and running prisons and municipal agencies, this only shows the limits of the trend. Really, it’s the community – the city of Cleveland – that should take the lead in formally thanking and honoring Ramsey. Ramsey, to his credit, has promised to give any reward money to the three kidnapping victims. But that only means that McDonald’s would be better off donating directly, and quietly, to any funds set up for that purpose, and stepping back. Follow me on Twitter or Facebook. My Forbes blog page is here.","completion":"McDonald's is attempting to get in touch with Charles Ramsey, the man who rescued three kidnapped women in Cleveland, due to an outpouring of social media requests asking the fast-food chain to honor or reward him.

However, McDonald's must be cautious not to appear as capitalizing on a series of terrible crimes, and should consider donating directly to any funds set up for the victims while stepping back from public involvement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You pass a group of people. The people are talking to each other. You cannot hear what they are saying. But suddenly they start laughing. What would you think? Would you think they were laughing at something funny that one of them said? Or -- be honest with yourself -- would you think they were laughing at you? Yes, you. Being laughed at is a common fear. But a major study published in two thousand and nine found that this fear is not the same around the world. It differs from culture to culture. People in Finland were the least likely to believe that people laughing in their presence were making fun of them. Less than ten percent of Finns in the study said they would think that, compared to eighty percent of people in Thailand. Some people in the study said they felt unsure of themselves in social situations but hid their feelings of insecurity. Others said they avoided social situations where they had been laughed at before. The study found that people in Turkmenistan and Cambodia were more likely to be in the first group. They would hide their feelings of insecurity if they were around other people's laughter. But people in Iraq, Egypt and Jordan were more likely to try to avoid such situations if they felt they had been laughed at before. Shy people often avoid situations that would force them into close contact with other people. They worry that something they say or do will make other people laugh at them. But some people worry much more than others. They may have a disorder called gelotophobia. Gelos is a Greek word. It means laughter. Phobia means fear. This fear of laughter can be truly sad for those who live with it. It can affect how they lead their lives. In the study, a team from the University of Zurich led more than ninety researchers from around the world. They wanted to understand the difference between normal shyness and true gelotophobia.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last step of the baking process after the cake has been baked for the required time is to carefully remove the cake from the oven. This should be done by using oven mitts or a thick cloth to ensure you do not burn yourself as the oven and the cake pan will both be extremely hot. Once the cake is out of the oven, you must let it cool before proceeding with any decoration or frosting. Place the cake pan on a wire cooling rack if available - if not, a cool counter-top will do. If you try to tip the cake out while it's still hot, it may break or crumble, so it's important to let it cool down in its pan. This could take from around 10 minutes to half an hour, depending on the size and thickness of the cake. After the cake has cooled adequately in its baking pan, you can then remove it from the pan. You do this by first taking a butter knife or a palette knife and running it around the edge of the cake to ensure it's not sticking to the sides of the pan. Then, place a larger plate or stand over the top of the cake pan and flip it upside down so the cake falls out onto the plate or stand. Now, your cake is ready for decoration. If you're using a frosting, ensure that it's not too runny or thick; you need it to spread easily but not drip off the cake. Use a palette knife or a butter knife to spread the frosting over the top of the cake and around the sides if desired. You can also use a piping bag to apply the icing in a decorative manner. After the frosting, you can add any other decorations you like, such as sprinkles, chocolate shavings, fresh fruits, or edible flowers. Be creative and make it unique and beautiful! Finally, cut a slice and enjoy a well-deserved treat. If you're not serving the cake immediately, make sure to store it properly. If the cake is frosted with a cream-based icing, it should be stored in the refrigerator. If it's covered in buttercream or ganache, it can stay at room temperature, preferably under a cake dome. Remember, practice makes perfect. If your cake didn't turn out as expected, don’t get discouraged. Analyze what went wrong and try again.

Answer the following question. A Sachertorte is a type of chocolate cake which originated in which country?","completion":"Sachertorte is a type of chocolate cake that originated in Austria, specifically in its capital city, Vienna. The cake was created in 1832 by Franz Sacher, a 16-year-old Austrian apprentice pastry chef at the court of Prince Klemens von Metternich, who was a prominent statesman and diplomat in the Austrian Empire. The prince requested a unique dessert for his distinguished guests, and it was then that the young Sacher came up with the recipe for this fabulous cake. The Sachertorte typically consists of two layers of dense and velvety chocolate sponge cake, separated by a thin layer of sweet and tangy apricot jam. The entire cake is then covered with a rich, glossy layer of dark chocolate ganache. This luscious combination gives the cake its distinctive bittersweet taste. To finish it off, it is usually garnished with a rosette of whipped cream, which is served on the side or next to the slice of cake. The original recipe for Sachertorte remains a well-guarded secret of the Hotel Sacher in Vienna, where it was first served in 1876. Eduard Sacher, Franz Sacher's son, and his wife Anna had established the hotel, and over time, the cake became an iconic symbol of Viennese cuisine. The hotel still serves the authentic Sachertorte, referred to as the \\"Original Sacher-Torte,\\" and has even trademarked the name, ensuring the consistency and quality of the cake served to its guests. Over the years, the Sachertorte has gained international renown and inspired various adaptations of the recipe, which can now be found in different countries with slight variations in flavor and presentation. However, the traditional Austrian version remains the most well-known and continues to be an essential element of the country's culinary heritage. In Austria, the Sachertorte is not only enjoyed in hotels and cafes, but it's also a popular cake to serve at home for special occasions or as a dessert during festive seasons. In fact, December 5th is recognized as National Sachertorte Day in Austria, which is a testament to the cake's importance and enduring popularity. In summary, the Sachertorte is a delicious and iconic chocolate cake that originated in Austria. Created by Franz Sacher in the early 19th century, it is now enjoyed by people all over the world and remains a symbol of culinary excellence and tradition for the Austrian people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Frank and Noah were two researchers. Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa. Which researcher observed a large amount of surface warming? Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Noah, the researcher who studied the climate of Antarctica, observed a larger amount of surface warming as compared to Frank who studied the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa.

This warming trend is partly offset by the autumn cooling in East Antarctica. The surface warming in West Antarctica has not led to substantial melting at the surface or directly affected the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. However, it is worth noting that there have been instances of ice shelves collapsing, such as the 2002 Larsen-B ice shelf collapse and the 2008 Wilkins Ice Shelf collapse, which have raised concerns on the effects of warming in the region. Furthermore, a study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth, providing further evidence that Noah, the researcher studying the climate of Antarctica, observed a larger amount of surface warming compared to Frank. Although the effects of human carbon dioxide emissions on Antarctica's warming trend remain ambiguous, the noticeable warming trend in various parts of the continent clearly demonstrates that Noah experienced a significant amount of surface warming during his research."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: Process: - One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air - Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming - This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle - The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun - It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans - Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere - The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains - This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish. Question: suppose cutting down more trees happens, how will it affect global warming increases. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"A: More Cutting down more trees will have a significant impact on increasing global warming. This can be explained through several factors that contribute to this detrimental effect on the environment. 1. Carbon sequestration: Trees play a crucial role in the carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. They act as natural \\"carbon sinks,\\" storing this carbon in various plant tissues, such as leaves, branches, and roots, and in the surrounding soil. When trees are cut down, this carbon-absorption capacity is lost. Moreover, if the trees are burned or left to decay, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, further contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. 2. Reduced cooling effect: Forests impact local and regional temperatures through the process of evapotranspiration, where water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and transpiration by plants. This process helps maintain the balance of temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, which in turn helps to regulate the earth's climate. When trees are removed, this cooling effect is diminished, leading to a rise in local temperatures that can contribute to the overall increase in global warming. 3. Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services: Forests are home to a diverse range of species and provide essential ecosystem services, such as water purification, pollination, and soil stabilization. Deforestation can lead to habitat loss and the extinction of species, disrupting the balance of ecosystems and making them less resilient to climate change. This can have cascading effects on the environment, affecting the planet's ability to adapt to changing conditions and increasing global warming. 4. Change in albedo: Albedo refers to the proportion of incoming solar radiation that is reflected by a surface back into space. Light-colored surfaces like snow, ice, and some tree canopies have a high albedo and help to reflect sunlight, keeping the earth cool. Dark surfaces, such as deforested lands and urban areas, absorb more sunlight, leading to an increase in surface temperatures. When trees are cut down and replaced with darker surfaces, the earth's surface absorbs more sunlight, contributing to global warming. In conclusion, cutting down more trees will lead to an increase in global warming due to the loss of carbon sequestration capacity, reduced cooling effect through evapotranspiration, disruption of ecosystems and their services, and changes in the earth's albedo. It is essential to promote responsible and sustainable forestry practices, as well as the preservation and restoration of existing forests, in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change and maintain a healthy and balanced environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The plan, which seeks to charge a fee for each e-mail sent, has been met with widespread disapproval from both individuals and organizations alike. The opposition is notable for its diversity, encompassing people with different political affiliations, social backgrounds, and professions. Among the opponents are not only average internet users who stand to be affected by the proposed fee plan, but also numerous businesses and advocacy groups that rely on e-mail as a primary means of communication. One reason for such a broad opposition is the concern that the fee plan would create a tiered system, segregating those who can afford the fees from those who cannot, effectively creating inequalities within the digital realm. This, critics argue, would have a far-reaching impact on digital communication, inhibiting access to vital information and services for those on the lower end of the economic scale. Furthermore, the plan raises concerns about the future of e-mail as a democratic platform. Currently, e-mail serves as an essential tool for communication, enabling people from all walks of life to easily exchange ideas, opinions, and information. By introducing a fee per e-mail sent, AOL would significantly alter the nature of e-mail communication, restricting its availability based on financial capability. This could potentially suppress the flow of ideas and counteract the democratizing effect the internet has had in recent decades. Business environments would also be affected by the implementation of such a plan. With e-mail being a primary means of communication in many industries, the fee plan could potentially increase overall operating costs, forcing businesses to reconsider their communication strategies and perhaps turn to alternative channels. This could have a trickle-down effect, impacting employees and stakeholders alike. As the opposition to AOL's proposed e-mail fee plan continues to grow, it remains unclear whether the company will proceed with its plans or reconsider its approach. Regardless of the outcome, the widespread concern and diverse range of groups speaking out against the proposal underscore the importance of equal access to digital communication in our modern society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

File-This March 22, 2005, file photo shows men wait outside the Cimarron Correctional Facility, in Cushing, Okla. Three inmates are dead and five injured after a disturbance at an Oklahoma prison, a spokesman... (Associated Press) The incident that also left four inmates injured happened around 4 p.m. Saturday at the Cimarron Correctional Facility in Cushing, a community between the state's two largest cities, Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The prison houses medium- and maximum-security male inmates. Three inmates were declared dead on Saturday and the fourth died overnight at a hospital. Terri Watkins, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections, said Sunday that preliminary reports show the first three men who died were fatally stabbed. But Watkins said she didn't know the nature of the injuries to any of the other inmates. The stabbings apparently happened in quick succession while the inmates at a medium-security wing of the prison were being let out of their cells into the exercise yard, Watkins said. \\"The entire stabbing incident happened over a couple of minutes,\\" Watkins said, adding that prisoners were all locked in their cells within 40 minutes of the outbreak of violence. No prison staff were injured or involved in the attack, Watkins said. None of the prisoners' names were released because their families had to be notified first, she said. One of the treated inmates was later returned to the prison and the other three remained hospitalized in stable condition Sunday, said Steve Owen, a spokesman for Tennessee-based Corrections Corporation of America, which owns and operates the prison. Owen said the inmate attacks lasted less than two minutes. He didn't immediately respond to an email Sunday seeking further details. It is the second major violent outburst in months at the prison. In June, some 200 to 300 of the prison's roughly 1,600 inmates were involved in a brawl there. Eleven prisoners were taken to hospitals after the fight and the facility was placed on lockdown. The fighting occurred among inmates in three separate housing units. Watkins said that as a precaution, all Oklahoma prisons have been placed on lockdown, which means that inmates are confined to their cells and their movement inside the facility is severely restricted. She said two separate investigations are underway — one by the Department of Corrections' inspector general's office and the other by CCA. Oklahoma has the highest rate of prison homicides in the nation, with state inmates killed at a rate more than three times the national average, according to figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The figures reviewed by The Associated Press as part of a months-long investigation earlier this year show that there were 39 homicides at Oklahoma prisons between 2001 and 2012, a rate of 14 per 100,000 inmates. The national average is 4 per 100,000. ___ Follow Sean Murphy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apseanmurphy ||||| A \\"disturbance\\" at an Oklahoma prison Saturday afternoon left four inmates dead and several more hospitalized, officials said Sunday.

But it took prison staff another 38 minutes to secure the single housing area where the killings took place, officials said. The facility, which is operated by the Corrections Corporation of America, houses 1,720 medium- and maximum-security male inmates.

Answer the following question: Article: The education of thousands of children with reading and sight trouble is being held back because of a lack of awareness of their legal rights, say campaigners. They are calling for greater efforts to increase awareness of the rights of such children to have text books in design other than standard print. The campaign is being supported by five times Olympic gold medalist, Sir Steve Redgrave, who has reading trouble. Pupils have the right to receive text in another way, and parents can take action under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) if they feel their children are being treated in a different way through a lack of support. But new research suggests 89 per cent of print disabled pupils and their parents are unaware of software which changes standard print into other substitutes like combined text and audio files which can be read or listened to. Sir Steve has teamed up with software company Dolphin Computer Access to raise awareness of software turning tools. He said: \\"I recognize that schools have competing priorities for their resources , but I would like to see a much greater effort on the part of the government and schools to raise awareness among parents that these additional solutions exist and that their children have a right to use them.\\" Mike Foster, Dolphin's local MP in Worcester, is _ the campaign. \\"There is clearly an issue to solve concerning software for special needs.

Options: - basement - antarctic - house - cellar - heat building Explain why a human would choose \\"house\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"house\\" as the answer to the question, \\"where does a furnace usually heat?\\" because a furnace is designed to provide warmth and maintain a comfortable indoor environment for residential spaces – particularly homes. While each of the other options might be associated with either heating or the presence of a furnace, the primary purpose of a furnace is centered around maintaining warmth within living spaces, which makes \\"house\\" the most accurate and relevant response among the options given. Let's explore the alternatives to provide a clearer understanding of why \\"house\\" is the best choice: 1. Basement: A basement may indeed be a location where a furnace is installed, but this option does not capture the essence of the question, as it merely indicates the physical location of the furnace and not the intended area it is meant to heat. Furnaces are installed in basements to supply heat to the entire house; thus, selecting \\"basement\\" as an answer would not fully address the question's intent. 2. Antarctic: The Antarctic is a geographic region at the Earth's southernmost continent. Although it experiences extremely cold temperatures, this option does not relate to the purpose or function of a furnace. Moreover, furnaces are typically used for heating indoor spaces, not entire regions or continents. 3. Cellar: A cellar can be compared to a basement as it is an enclosed underground space within a house, often used for storage purposes. While a furnace might be located in a cellar, the main purpose of the furnace is still to provide heating to the entire house. Similar to the basement reasoning, choosing \\"cellar\\" omits the overall objective of a furnace – to heat the entire living space. 4. Heat building: This option could be a potential answer if the question were about a furnace’s purpose. However, it is unclear whether \\"heat building\\" refers to a specific type of building or if it simply rephrases the act of heating a building. Consequently, this option lacks clarity and specificity compared to \\"house,\\" which straightforwardly indicates the space where a furnace is typically used. In summary, although some of the other options provided can be related to the presence or function of a furnace, a human would choose \\"house\\" because it is the most accurate answer aligning with the core purpose of a furnace – to provide heating to living spaces, specifically residential homes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A pony bit me earlier.\\" As it happened, the bite was virtually painless: more the kind of small bite you might get from a naughty child. The pony responsible was queuing up for some ice cream in the car park near Haytor, and perhaps thought I'd jumped in ahead of him. The reason why the ponies here are naughty is that Haytor is a tourist-heavy area and tourists are constantly feeding the ponies foods, despite sighs asking them not to. By feeding the ponies, tourists increase the risk of them getting hit by a car, and make them harder to gather during the area's annual pony drift . The purpose of a pony drift is to gather them up so their health can be checked, the baby ones can be stooped from feeding on their mother's milk, and those who've gone beyond their limited area can be returned to their correct area. Some of them are also later sold, in order to limit the number of ponies according to the rules set by Natural England. Three weeks ago, I witnessed a small near-disaster a few mils west of here. While walking, I noticed a pony roll over on his back. \\"Hello!\\" I said to him, assuming he was just rolling for fun, but he was very still and, as I got closer, I saw him kicking his legs in the air and breathing heavily. I began to properly worry about him. Fortunately, I managed to get in touch with a Dartmoor's Livestock Protection officer and send her a photo. The officer immediately sent a local farmer out to check on the pony. The pony had actually been trapped between two rocks. The farmer freed him, and he began to run happily around again. Dartmoor has 1,000 or so ponies, who play a critical role in creating the diversity of species in this area. Many people are working hard to preserve these ponies, and trying to come up with plans to find a sustainable future for one of Dartmoor's most financially-troubled elements. Question: What does the author imply about the preservation of Dartmoor's ponies? - It lacks people's involvement. - It costs a large amount of money - It will affect tourism in Dartmoor. - It has caused an imbalance of species Answer:","completion":"It costs a large amount of money"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: A man who was injured by a suicide bomb blast in Hangu lies while awaiting treatment at the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar on May 26, 2011. ISLAMABAD | ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed 24 people in Pakistan on Thursday in the latest militant attack since the death of Osama bin Laden which has angered Pakistan and led to a call for the United States to withdraw some of its military trainers. The killing of bin Laden by U.S. special forces in a Pakistani town on May 2 has sparked a wave of militant attacks and has also led to a sharp erosion of trust between Pakistan and its ally, the United States. A suicide car-bomber set off explosives outside a police station in the northwestern town of Hangu a day after a similar attack destroyed a police station in the city of Peshawar. \\"We're trying to remove rubble and there's fear some people could be trapped,\\" a government official in Hangu, Adil Siddique, told Reuters by telephone. Police said the toll could rise beyond 24 as many among 45 people wounded were in serious condition. Pakistani Taliban militants, allied with al Qaeda, claimed responsibility. They have vowed revenge for bin Laden's death. The raid that killed bin Laden at his compound in Abbottabad, 50 km (30 miles) northwest of Islamabad, intensified U.S. questions about Pakistan's possible role in sheltering militants, straining an already fragile relationship. But many Pakistanis saw the top-secret U.S. raid as a violation of sovereignty and some members of parliament have asked for a review of ties with Washington, which gives Pakistan billions of dollars in aid to help in the war against Islamist militants. Pakistan had informed the United States in the last week or two that it would not need some U.S. special forces trainers advising the Pakistani military, the Pentagon said. Pakistani security officials said the decision came three days after the al Qaeda leader's death. \\"We don't need unnecessary people here. They cause problems for us instead of being helpful,\\" said a Pakistani security official who declined to be identified. He said the withdrawal might start by early June. Another Pakistani security official said the decision was made because of concerns over the Americans' security and because \\"resentment all around was very high.\\" Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan said there had been \\"no real change\\" to the small U.S. military training mission in Pakistan. The number of trainers in Pakistan was not disclosed but Lapan said the entire military mission has ranged between 200 and 300 people. Other Pakistani and U.S. military sources in Pakistan have said the special forces training component formerly numbered about 120 and would be drawn down to less than 50. Other U.S. troops are involved in helicopter maintenance, liaising with the Pakistani military and aid efforts. It is unclear if they will also be withdrawn. \\"Essential people are being asked to stay,\\" the second security official said. \\"This includes SSG (special forces) and technical assistance.\\" While seeking answers to questions surrounding bin Laden's movements, the United States has been keen to prevent a complete breakdown in relations with an ally whose help is seen as essential for efforts to stabilize neighboring Afghanistan. \\"BITTER FIGHT\\" While hinting that Pakistan could do more in its counter-terrorism efforts, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised it as a \\"good partner.\\" \\"We do have a set of expectations that we are looking for the Pakistani government to meet, but I want to underscore in conclusion it is not as though they have been on the sidelines,\\" Clinton told a news conference in Paris. She gave no details. \\"They have been actively engaged in their own bitter fight ... and we are going to look to put our partnership on as strong a foundation going forward as possible,\\" she said. As the United States starts to withdraw troops from Afghanistan this year and some U.S. lawmakers are urging the Obama administration to reconsider assistance to Pakistan in the wake of the bin Laden raid. U.S. aid has also led to quarrels between Pakistan's civilian government and its armed forces over how U.S. military funds were spent, according to WikiLeaks, highlighting the turf battles and lack of transparency over billions of dollars. U.S. diplomatic cables in 2009, published by Dawn newspaper, showed then Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin asked the U.S. embassy to keep him informed of American aid given directly to the military, saying the army chief did not pass on the information. At the same time, some Pakistan government officials feared money from a special reimbursement fund was being \\"siphoned off into private coffers.\\" Washington, too, was concerned military funds were being diverted by the civilian government for social programs, cables said. Many critics wonder if U.S. aid is misspent to beef up Pakistan's military capabilities against old rival India, or possibly to bolster its nuclear weapons program. Pakistan has received 20.7 billion worth of U.S. assistance over the past decade, about two-thirds of it military aid intended to improve the army's capabilities against militants.

Con Conquest of Mexico .\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The conquest of Mexico lasted a long time.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"Con Conquest of Mexico,\\" it is not entirely clear what specific events or time period the statement is referring to. However, if we assume that this premise is referring to the historical series of events associated with the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, which was a significant part of the larger Spanish colonization of the Americas, we can analyze the hypothesis \\"The conquest of Mexico lasted a long time.\\" The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, led by Hernán Cortés, began in 1519 and ended in 1521. The Aztec Empire, centered in Mexico and led by Moctezuma II at the time, was a highly advanced and complex civilization. Following initial meetings and diplomacy between the Spanish and the Aztecs, the relationships between the two groups quickly deteriorated. The conquest was characterized by significant battles, political maneuvering, and eventual subjugation of the Aztec Empire. The timeline for the conquest of Mexico can be seen as quite short, as it lasted only two years from 1519 to 1521. However, considering the complexity of the Aztec Empire and the extent of the Spanish colonization efforts in the Americas, one could argue that the complete subjugation of indigenous populations and the establishment of stable Spanish rule took much longer than the initial conquest. Following the fall of the Aztec Empire, there were numerous uprisings, confrontations, and tensions between the Spanish colonizers and the indigenous populations. The process of \\"pacification\\" conducted by the Spanish authorities, which aimed to suppress indigenous resistance, took many years to complete. The Spanish colonizers employed a variety of tactics, including forced labor systems and the spread of European diseases, which significantly contributed to the decline of the indigenous population. Furthermore, the integration of the remaining indigenous peoples into the newly formed colonial society took several generations, as many aspects of indigenous culture and religion were forcibly suppressed and replaced with Spanish culture and Catholicism. The lasting impacts of the Spanish conquest of Mexico can still be observed today in the cultural, demographic, and linguistic features of modern Mexican society. In conclusion, while the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, which can be considered a significant aspect of the conquest of Mexico, took only two years, the process of subjugating, assimilating, and controlling the indigenous populations and territories took much longer, lasting several generations. Taking this broader perspective into consideration, the hypothesis \\"The conquest of Mexico lasted a long time.\\" can be regarded as true. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on the assumption that the premise \\"Con Conquest of Mexico\\" refers to the historical events associated with the Spanish colonization of the Aztec Empire and its surrounding territories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history. - George Francis McGinnins ( March 19 , 1826 -- May 29 , 1910 ) was a volunteer soldier during the Mexican - American War and a Union General during the American Civil War . - The Confederate States, officially the Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized breakaway country of 11 secessionist slave states existing from 1861 to 1865. It was originally formed by seven slave states South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas in the Lower South region of the United States whose regional economy was mostly dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves. - A soldier is one who fights as part of an organised, land-based armed force. A soldier can be an enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, or an officer. - A non-commissioned officer or noncommissioned officer (NCO, colloquially non-com or noncom) is a military officer who has not earned a commission. Such is also called sub-officer in some countries. Non-commissioned officers, in the English-speaking world, usually obtain their position of authority by promotion through the enlisted ranks. In contrast, commissioned officers hold higher ranks than NCOs, have more legal responsibilities, are paid more, and often have more non-military training such as a university diploma.

Article: The man who invented Coca-Cola was not a native Atlanta, but on the day of his funeral every drugstore in town shut up the shop in honor of him. He was John Styth Pemberton, born in 1833 in Knoxville, Georgia, eighty miles away. Pemberton was a chemist, sometimes known as Doctor, who, during the Civil War, became an officer and led a cavalry troop. He settled in Atlanta in 1869, and soon began making such patent medicines as Triplex Liver Pills and Globe of Flower Cough Syrup. In 1885, he registered a trademark for something called French Wine Coca-Ideal Nerve and Tonic Stimulant. A few months later, he formed the Pemberton Chemical Company, and hired an accountant named Frank M. Robinson, who had not only a good head for figures, but, attached to it, so unique a nose that he could judge the ingredients of a batch of syrup merely by sniffing it. In 1886 --- a year in which, as contemporary Coca-Cola officials like to point out, the English writer Conan Doyle made Sherlock Holmes known publicly and France found the truth about the Statue of Liberty --- Pemberton invented a syrup that he called Coca-Cola. It was a change of his French Wine Coca. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and, when the end product tasted awful, had thrown in some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his back yard and swishing it around with an oar. He distributed it to soda fountains in used beer bottles, and Robinson, with his elegant account's script, instantly designed a label, on which \\"Coca-Cola\\" was written in the style which is still employed. Pemberton looked upon his mixture less as a drink than as a headache cure. One morning in 1886, a man suffering from a headache dragged himself into an Atlanta drugstore and asked for a bottle of Coca-Cola. According to usual practice, druggists should pour a teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of water, but at that time, the man on duty was too lazy to walk to the fresh-water tap. Instead, he mixed the syrup with some soda... Question: How did Pemberton change French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious? Options: A: He mixed it with several oils instead of water.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Consumer Prices Post Sharp Annual Drop WASHINGTON -Consumer prices were flat in July as energy costs retreated following a big surge in June. Over the past 12 months, prices dropped the most in nearly six decades as the recession and lower energy costs kept a lid on inflation. The Commerce Department says consumer prices showed no changed in July, in line with analysts' expectations and far below the 0.7 percent jump in June. Prices fell 2.1 percent over the past 12 months, the biggest annual decline since a similar drop in the period ending in January 1950. Most of the past year's decline reflects energy prices falling 28.1 percent since peaking in July 2008. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. WASHINGTON (AP) — Retail sales dropped in July, government data showed, reinforcing concerns among economists that consumers won't spend enough to help a recovery take hold. But Friday is expected to bring better news: July inflation is expected to have remained flat, and industrial production is likely to have grown for the first time in nine months. Thursday's retail sales report served as a reality check for an economy that lately has appeared poised to emerge from recession and grow again. Consumer spending powers about 70 percent of economic activity. The Cash for Clunkers rebate program helped give auto sales their biggest jump in six months in July, but sales sank elsewhere. Gas stations, department stores, electronics outlets and furniture stores all suffered. Overall, sales fell 0.1 percent, the Commerce Department said, after two months of modest gains. Economists had expected a 0.7 percent increase. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.6 percent, also much worse than predicted. Unemployment, flat wages, tighter credit, fear of layoffs and the urge to save more have caused many consumers to spend less. Shrinking home equity and stock portfolios have compounded the problem. As a result, \\"households are in no position to drive a decent economic recovery,\\" Paul Dales, U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. Even Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which had managed to post robust sales during the recession, reported an unexpected drop in quarterly earnings. The company faulted lower prices for groceries and other products. But it warned that the economy continues to force customers to scale back their purchases. Still, low prices should provide some comfort for consumers. The worst recession since World War II has kept prices in check, as workers can't demand higher pay due to the scarcity of jobs. Companies have been unable to boost prices because of weak demand. Over the 12 months ending in June, consumer prices fell 1.4 percent, the biggest decline in almost six decades. That trend is expected to continue when the Labor Department reports the consumer price index figures for July on Friday at 8:30 a.m. EDT. The latest figures came just a day after the Federal Reserve said the economy appeared to be \\"leveling out.\\" The Fed, signaling the recession appears to be ending, said it would hold interest rates at their current record lows. The success of Cash for Clunkers is also expected to push industrial production up 0.3 percent in July. If the forecast is correct, the increase would come after industrial production fell in 17 of the previous 18 months. The report is slated to be released Friday at 9:15 a.m. EDT. But some analysts say people buying cars under Cash for Clunkers might be holding that money back from other sectors of the economy where they might otherwise spend it. Some of Europe's largest economies also benefited from government programs to support the auto industry. Germany and France returned to economic growth in the second quarter, raising hopes the recession will end throughout Europe sooner than thought. In the United States, weak retail sales were widespread in July. One gauge that excludes autos, gas and building materials fell slightly, the fifth straight month of declines. Department store sales fell 1.6 percent last month. And the broader category of general merchandise stores, which includes big chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp., dropped 0.8 percent. Gas station sales plunged 2.1 percent in July — more because of falling prices at the pump than shrinking demand. On Wall Street, stocks rose modestly. The Dow Jones industrials finished up about 37 points at just above 9,398 — their highest close since the market lows of early March. Employers cut the fewest number of jobs in July in nearly a year, and the unemployment rate fell for the first time in 15 months. But jobs remain scarce. More than 6.2 million Americans are receiving jobless benefits, the government said Thursday — 140,000 fewer than the previous week. Counting people taking advantage of an unemployment benefits program enacted by Congress, 9.25 million people received unemployment compensation in the week that ended July 25, down about 100,000 from the week before, as new claims rose but some recipients ran out of benefits and fell off the rolls, economists said. The nonprofit National Employment Law Project has calculated that 540,000 people will exhaust their emergency benefits without finding work by the end of September. And by the end of the year, it predicts 1.5 million will run out. That prospect has some in Congress calling for a further extension of benefits. Obama administration officials have said they would support an extension. AP Business Writers Martin Crutsinger and Alan Zibel in Washington, and Anne D'Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

The Corbett administration said its lawsuit seeking to halt same-sex marriage licenses in Montgomery County \\"would have no direct effect\\" on the couples who have already received them. In a brief Wednesday, state attorneys said those marriage licenses were never valid, and compared gay and lesbian couples to \\"12-year-olds\\" who are also barred from marrying under state law. The state Department of Health and Montgomery County Register of Wills D. Bruce Hanes will appear in Commonwealth Court next Wednesday to argue the case. A 1996 law defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Hanes and his supporters argue that the law is unconstitutional and discriminatory. Since July 24, Hanes has issued 154 marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples. Thirty-two of the couples have petitioned to intervene in the case, arguing that a ruling against Hanes could also invalidate their marriages. The state filed a brief Wednesday opposing the couples' participation, arguing that their marriage licenses hold no \\"actual value or legitimacy\\" and thus have no right to be defended in court. \\"Had the clerk issued marriage licenses to 12-year-olds in violation of state law, would anyone seriously contend that each 12-year-old . . . is entitled to a hearing on the validity of his 'license'?\\" the state wrote.

Tom Corbett's attorneys said Wednesday. Corbett's administration has filed a lawsuit seeking to block same-sex marriage licenses in suburban Philadelphia, where Montgomery County Register of Wills D. Bruce Hanes has issued more than 150 to gay and lesbian couples since July 24. State attorneys said in a court filing on Wednesday the gay marriage licenses have no \\"value or legitimacy'' and can't be defended in court. They compared gay and lesbian couples to children, who can't marry because a 1996 law says marriage is between a man and a woman. \\"Had the clerk issued marriage licenses to 12-year-olds in violation of state law, would anyone seriously contend that each 12-year-old ... is entitled to a hearing on the validity of his 'license'?'' the state wrote in a case brief. The state Department of Health brought the case against Hanes. Hanes, who says the state law is unconstitutional and discriminatory, is scheduled to appear in Commonwealth Court next week in the case. More than 30 gay and lesbian couples that received marriage licenses from Hanes say a ruling against him could invalidate their marriages, and they've sought to participate in the case. The state opposes their participation and their efforts to defend what it calls their \\"purported marriage licenses.'' It said the gay and lesbian couples should file their own lawsuits or wait to see what happens with a federal challenge to the state's marriage law. \\"This case is about one thing: whether a local official may willfully disregard a statute based on his personal legal opinion that the statute is unconstitutional,'' the state's lawyers wrote. The Commonwealth Court last week laid out the topics to be argued at the Sept. 4 hearing on the marriage licenses issued by Hanes. It wants lawyers to focus on whether the court has jurisdiction, given that Hanes is a judicial officer. Other questions are whether issuing marriage licenses is a judicial act and whether the constitutionality of the state's marriage law can be raised as a defense. Also at issue are whether the Department of Health has standing to sue, and, if not, the effect of Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Kane's delegation of defense of the law to the governor's legal staff.

Please write a short summary for the following article: A Gutsy Gut Renovation in London The house that Caroline Baldwin and Brian Taylor bought has been described—and by its former owner, to boot—as “the most expensive slum in Britain.” And while £1.8 million, or 2.5 million, isn’t especially expensive by London standards, it is certainly a lot to pay for a Georgian townhouse so decrepit that the first thing the couple did was put up scaffolding to stop it falling down around them. “It was in such a bad state that we were advised we couldn’t even go in to some of the rooms in case the ceilings fell,” said Mrs. Baldwin. Now, after a top-to-bottom renovation, this former slum is a light-filled family house. And, although the restoration project cost 1.27 million, the work, plus strong market conditions over the past four years, means the house is now valued at an estimated 5.7 million. Their house, in the affluent northwest London neighborhood of Islington, had been owned for decades by Fran and Jay Landesman, an elderly and rather eccentric couple whose lifestyle has been chronicled in British newspapers by their journalist son, Cosmo. He gave their home the “most expensive slum” moniker in a newspaper article in 2010, recounting how his aging hippie parents refused to throw anything away and regarded cleaning as a “bourgeois hang-up.” After Fran and Jay died, Mr. Landesman put the house up for sale, and in 2012 the Baldwin-Taylors agreed to buy it. The couple—he’s 43 and she’s 36—had been living in Ghana, working for a shipping and logistics company. But they wanted to return to Britain full time so that their daughter Maya, now 7, could be educated in England. The neglected house’s structural instability was one challenge the family faced. The other was that, because the house was an example of classic Georgian architecture, any work they carried out had to be approved by the local council. Initially, the couple had hoped to enlarge the kitchen but were refused building permits. Instead they added a garden room at the end of their backyard and expanded the existing basement—moves that increased the property’s square footage from 2,850 square feet to around 3,000 square feet. Along with shoring up precarious ceilings, waterproofing the basement, and restoring load-bearing walls that the Landesmans had knocked down, the homeowners’ main challenge was to conserve the house’s original features with the help of Gerard Rainey, senior architect at the firm Architecture for London. “We wanted to retain as much of the Georgian features as we could,” said Mrs. Baldwin. “The house also felt very dark, and very convoluted, and we wanted to make it as bright, and as classy, as possible.” They reclaimed original wide pine floorboards from elsewhere in the house to restore the living room floor. They hunted down a grate for the fireplace that was also of the correct period to fit the house and replaced postwar windows with modern re-creations of original Georgian sash windows. Their kitchen is an exercise in simplicity: wood cabinets painted gray; chunky, white Corian countertops and a white marble-tiled backsplash. While the palette in most of the rest of the house is pale and neutral, Mrs. Baldwin has let her love of color loose in the living room, with sofas in rich navy blue, teal and purple. Double doors open onto a study, with walls painted a deep charcoal that sets off a modern, scarlet chandelier. The couple’s master bedroom suite, one of the home’s four bedrooms, is at the top of the five-story property. The build started in July 2014, and the family moved in last April. Work continued until August on the basement, which now has a living room, bedroom and bathroom. The adjacent “coal hole” is now a kitchen. Outside, they added a decked terrace area with built-in barbecue and steps that lead down to a paved patio framed by curved, raised flower beds. Mr. Rainey worked around a London plane tree, designing a garden room with a curved roof echoing the flower beds. This room could be a study or a sitting room, but is currently being used as a guest bedroom suite. The family is now settling into their new home. “It is fantastic,” said Mrs. Baldwin. “I used to walk through this street as a teenager and think how I would love to live here one day, so in many ways it is a culmination of a very old dream for me.”","completion":"Caroline Baldwin and Brian Taylor purchased a run-down Georgian townhouse for £1.8 million (2.5 million) in Islington, a wealthy area in northwest London.

Gather materials: Before starting, gather the necessary materials, which include the paper, cardboard, and glue. Using glue is the best option here, as it is specifically designed for attaching paper and similar materials, whereas soldering is meant for joining metal components. 2. Align the paper: Place the paper on a flat surface, ensuring it is properly aligned over the cardboard. This step is crucial for making sure the paper attaches to the cardboard neatly and without any unsightly wrinkles or creases. 3. Apply glue: Apply glue to the back of the paper or directly onto the cardboard surface, depending on the type of glue you're using. Be sure to follow the glue's instructions to make sure you're using the appropriate amount and application method. 4. Attach paper to cardboard: Carefully place the paper onto the glued surface of the cardboard. Press down gently and evenly across the entire surface of the paper to eliminate any air bubbles and ensure a strong bond between the paper and cardboard. 5. Allow time to dry: Once the paper is in place, give it time to dry according to the glue manufacturer's recommended drying time. This might vary depending on the specific glue brand and type being used. 6. Trim excess edges: If any excess paper or glue is visible along the edges of the cardboard, trim it off carefully with a pair of scissors or a utility knife.

Information: - Nazi exploitation (also Nazisploitation) is a subgenre of exploitation film and sexploitation film that involves Nazis committing sex crimes, often as camp or prison overseers during World War II. Most follow the women-in-prison formula, only relocated to a concentration camp, death camp, or Nazi brothel, and with an added emphasis on sadism, gore, and degradation. The most infamous and influential title (which set the standards of the genre) is a Canadian production, \\"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\\" (1974). Its surprise success and sequels led European film-makers, mostly in Italy, to produce dozens of similar films. While the \\"Ilsa\\" series were profitable, the other films were mostly box-office flops, and the genre all but vanished by the mid-1980s. - Love Camp 7 is a 1969 U.S. women - in - prison Nazi exploitation B - movie directed by Lee Frost and written by Wes Bishop and Bob Cresse , the latter of whom also acts as a sadistic camp commandant . - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - An exploitation film is a film that attempts to succeed financially by exploiting current trends, niche genres, or lurid content. - A brothel or bordello is a place where people may come to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute, sometimes referred to as a sex worker. Technically, any premises where prostitution commonly takes place qualifies as a brothel.

From the very beginning, the film struggles to establish a coherent storyline, leaving audiences confused and disoriented amidst a sea of disjointed scenes. Director John Foster's thinly veiled attempts to integrate magic, fantasy, and drama fall flat as the film's pacing awkwardly staggers between languid exposition and frenzied action sequences. The Forgotten Forest's artificial dialogue lands with a resounding thud, its hollow words devoid of any genuine emotion or wit. Undeniably, the film squanders the potential of an initially intriguing premise - a hidden forest with mystical powers - succumbing to a perplexing mishmash of undercooked ideas that lead nowhere. Aside from its narrative issues, The Forgotten Forest is further mitigated by subpar performances from its woefully miscast ensemble. Lead actor Michael Reeves delivers a wooden and unconvincing portrayal of the protagonist, Alex, leaving much to be desired in terms of emotional depth and believability. Likewise, the supporting cast feels bland and uninspired, leaving audiences hard-pressed to invest in their struggles and triumphs. Moreover, the film's visuals and special effects do little to salvage the overall experience. The forest's supposedly enchanting setting appears artificial and markedly unremarkable, punctuated by moments of laughably amateurish CGI. Even the film's score, composed by the normally reliable Stephen Richards, lacks the necessary gravitas to elevate the story to a more captivating level – ultimately proving to be just another disappointment in a long line of unfulfilled promises.

Bruce Jenner comes out as transgender, says 'I am a woman' NEW YORK (AP) — In the 1970s, Bruce Jenner was a symbol of American masculinity as an Olympic champion. Nearly 40 years later, in an extraordinary television interview, Jenner told the world that he identifies as a woman and has felt gender confusion since he was a little boy growing up in the New York suburbs. Jenner let his hair down — literally loosening a ponytail and letting his hair flow past his shoulders — in a symbolic moment at the start of his two-hour interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer that was televised Friday. \\"Yes, for all intents and purposes, I am a woman.\\" For the transgender community, it was a moment as significant as Ellen DeGeneres' coming out as a lesbian was for gays nearly 20 years ago. DeGeneres tweeted support to Jenner, saying the former Olympian was \\"saving lives and opening minds.\\" \\"My whole life has been getting me ready for this,\\" said Jenner, 65, known to a younger generation as the patriarch of television's omnipresent Kardashian clan. \\"It's not just the last few years as they've been treating me as a joke.\\" The interview was filmed in February in Los Angeles and New York, before a fatal car accident in which Jenner was involved. The Nielsen company said an audience of just fewer than 17 million people saw the interview. Jenner said he self-identifies as \\"her,\\" not a specific name. But he told Sawyer he felt comfortable using the pronouns \\"he\\" and \\"him,\\" a designation that is an important issue for many in the transgender community, which believes that transgender people should be referred to by the pronouns with which they choose to identify. Jenner said his \\"brain is more female than it is male.\\" He said he began gender reassignment therapy in the 1980s — taking hormones, having surgery to make his nose smaller and having hair removed from his face and chest — but gave it up. As Jenner got older, he realized that if he got sick and faced death without facing up to this issue, \\"I'd be so mad that I didn't explore that side of my life.\\" As a young boy, Jenner felt an urge to try on his mother's and sister's dresses. \\"I didn't know why I was doing it,\\" he said. \\"It just made me feel good.\\" Jenner said he has never been sexually attracted to men, and he wanted to make clear to viewers that gender identity and sexuality were separate things. \\"I am not gay,\\" he said. \\"I am, as far as I know, heterosexual. I've always been with a woman, raising kids.\\" Jenner said he has not decided whether he will undergo sexual reassignment surgery. \\"These are all things that are out there in the future for me to explore,\\" he said. \\"There's no rush for that. And I would do it so quietly that nobody in the world would know.\\" Jenner's four oldest children appeared on the interview special to support their father, but not the two girls he had with Kris Kardashian. He said his stepdaughter Kim has been a big supporter, urged on by husband Kanye West, but that his stepdaughter Khloe was taking it the hardest. Jenner's first two wives offered messages of support; ABC said Kris Kardashian's publicist called to specifically say his third wife would have no comment. But Kardashian tweeted that no one had asked for comment and, after the interview aired, tweeted: \\"Not only was I able to call him my husband for 25 years and father of my children, I am now able to call him my hero.\\" Jenner told Sawyer that Kris was having a difficult time with it, and that if she better understood it, the couple would probably still be together. Jenner's 89-year-old mother also was interviewed, saying she was more proud of Bruce than when he stood as an Olympic champion in Montreal. The E! Entertainment network announced that Jenner would be part of a documentary series about the transition that would begin airing on July 26. Hollywood offered support. \\"Tonight\\" host Jimmy Fallon, echoing Neil Armstrong when the astronaut took his first steps on the moon, tweeted: \\"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" \\"Today, millions of people learned that someone they know is transgender,\\" said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. \\"By sharing this story, Bruce Jenner has shined a light on what it means to be transgender and live authentically in the face of unimaginable public scrutiny.

Moccasins are the best option, but a simple flat, brown slip-on shoe would coordinate with the look. Basic brown suede boots would also work as long as they have a flat sole. Fur-lined or fringed boots can add some flair to your costume. If you do not expect to walk through mud puddles, you can also wear moccasin-style slippers. Simple brown sandals could also work as long as they are not embellished with other decorations. Start with a brown cloth headband that wraps around the head rather than over it. Use a hot glue gun to attach one to three feathers to the inside of the headband. Position them so they are at the side of the head and behind the ear. If you cannot find a brown wrap-around headband, cut a strip of stretchy brown fabric that is long enough to fit around the wearer's head and add an extra 1-inch (2.5-cm) to the length. Loop the strip of fabric around to create a band, using fabric glue or hot glue to secure the extra 1-inch (2.5-cm) of fabric over the other end of the band. If you want to give your headband extra flair, decorate it with wooden beads, colorful seed beads, or craft paint. If you want to add a little extra shape to your tunic, tie a braided leather sash around the wearer's waist. If you can’t find a sash or belt without a buckle, cut a strip of brown leather, canvas, or brown rope that is long enough to wrap around the waist. Make sure to cut enough extra material so you can tie the belt into a loose bow at the front of the costume. A fringed leather belt can add an attractive touch to your costume too.

In the first act we meet the Ekdahl family -- large, joyous, prosperous. Then Oscar (Allan Edwall), father of Alexander (Bertil Guve) who might be 11 and Fanny (Pernilla Allwin) who might be 7, dies.In act two, Oscar appears to his children. Alexander asks why he doesn't go off to Heaven. Oscar replies that he doesn't want to leave those he lived with. The children's mother remarries in less than a year, going to a strict Bishop Edvard Vergerus' (Jan Malmsjö) house with none of her furniture, none of the children's toys, and an optimism that she can make a good thing of it despite his powerfully controlling personality. Alexander learns from the ghost of the Bishop's first wife that she and her children died trying to escape after having been locked up for days. They climbed out a window but failed to make it across the cold fast-flowing stream that separates the back of the house from the town. Alexander tells this to a servant who repeats it to the Bishop. The Bishop must discredit this story, and demands retraction. Then he locks up the boy.In act three, Isak (Erland Josephson), a family friend, arrives at the house, ostensibly to buy a chest, but actually to smuggle the children out of the house (in the chest!). During this escape, the ghosts of his former family appear to the Bishop. The children are kept for the moment in Isak's house, where Alexander meets Ismael Retzinsky (Stina Ekblad) whose paranormal abilities help Alexander start a fire in the Bishop's house, a fire that is fatal to the hated step-father.In the final act, mother (Ewa Fröling) and children are back in the warm comfort of their extended family's house. Gustav (Jarl Kulle), the late Oscar's brother, gives a toast in which he summarizes the play.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How shall I convince you to consider Haskell as official language in OpenAI? What are some good projects to learn Haskell language?","completion":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. While both questions are related to the Haskell programming language, they address different aspects and goals. Question 1: How shall I convince you to consider Haskell as an official language in OpenAI? This question aims to gather information and arguments that could be used to persuade someone (in this case, most likely OpenAI) to consider Haskell as an official language for their projects. The focus here is on the reasons and benefits that Haskell could bring to the organization and why it should be adopted as an official language. A detailed and long answer for this question would involve providing an outline of: 1. Haskell's unique features and advantages: - Purely functional programming: Emphasizes immutability and the absence of side effects, which helps create clean, modular, and maintainable code. - Strong static typing: Helps catch many errors during the compilation process and prevents a wide range of runtime errors, improving code reliability. - Lazy evaluation: Allows for efficient, high-level programming abstractions by evaluating expressions only when necessary. - Concurrency and parallelism support: Provides lightweight threads and synchronization primitives that make Haskell a suitable choice for concurrent and parallel programming tasks. 2. Success stories of organizations and projects using Haskell: - Companies like Facebook, Standard Chartered Bank, and Galois have successfully adopted Haskell for their projects. - Open-source projects such as Cardano, a decentralized cryptocurrency platform, and Pandoc, a universal document converter, employ Haskell for critical components. 3. The growing Haskell community and ecosystem: - Numerous libraries and tools, such as Stack and Cabal for package management, Hackage as a package repository, and frameworks like Yesod for web development, are available to Haskell developers. - There are numerous events and meetups, such as the Haskell eXchange conference and ZuriHac, dedicated to learning, discussing, and promoting Haskell. - Online resources like Learn You a Haskell for Great Good and Haskell School of Music provide high-quality educational materials for learning Haskell. Question 2: What are some good projects to learn the Haskell language? This question focuses on exploring potential projects that can help someone learn the Haskell programming language. The aim here is to provide ideas and suggestions for hands-on practical experience to learn and practice Haskell effectively. A detailed and long answer for this question would involve providing a list of suggested project ideas, such as: 1. Command-line utilities: - Implement common Unix utilities like \\"grep,\\" \\"cat,\\" or \\"wc\\" in Haskell to understand basic syntax, data structures, and IO operations. 2. Functional data structures: - Implement classic data structures (for example, stacks, queues, and trees) using functional programming concepts to grasp the basic principles of Haskell. 3. Web applications: - Use a web development framework such as Yesod to create a simple web application, such as a blog or a to-do list app. 4. Parser combinators: - Write a parser for a programming language or markup format (e.g., JSON, XML, or a simple calculator language) using parser combinators to get acquainted with the world of monads and applicative functors. 5. Implement a simple game: - Create a text-based or a simple graphical game using the Gloss or SDL library to understand the interaction between functional programming and realtime systems. 6. A Projects Euler solver: - Solve math problems from the Project Euler website using Haskell's expressive and concise syntax to boost your problem-solving skills using functional concepts. These two questions serve distinct purposes - one focusing on advocating for Haskell's adoption in an organization and the other on providing project ideas for learning Haskell. While they are both related to Haskell, the inquiries target separate aspects of the language and its usage, and thus, they do not have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given an arithmetic operation in Italian and you have to find its answer. The operations 'addition' and 'subtraction' have been replaced with their italian translations i.e you need to perform addition when you see 'aggiunta' and subtraction in case of 'sottrazione'. Q: 2779 aggiunta 4009 sottrazione 3483 sottrazione 2614 sottrazione 1960 sottrazione 4254 A:","completion":"To find the answer, we will complete the operation step-by-step from left to right, using the Italian words for addition ('aggiunta') and subtraction ('sottrazione'). Starting from the left, you have: 1. '2779 aggiunta 4009' translates to '2779 plus 4009'. Adding 2779 and 4009 leads to 6788. 2. Then, '6788 sottrazione 3483' translates to '6788 minus 3483'. Subtracting 3483 from 6788 leaves a remainder of 3305. 3. Moving on, '3305 sottrazione 2614' becomes '3305 minus 2614'. This gives us 691. 4. To that, we apply '691 sottrazione 1960' or '691 minus 1960'. Since 1960 is greater than 691, the result will be a negative value: -1269. 5. Finally, '-1269 sottrazione 4254' means '-1269 minus 4254'. Again, since 4254 is greater than 1269 (even if 1269 is negative), the result is a more negative value: -5523. So, 2779 aggiunta 4009 sottrazione 3483 sottrazione 2614 sottrazione 1960 sottrazione 4254 equals -5523."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Between the third and fourth sessions the pope announced reforms in the areas of Roman Curia, revision of Canon Law, regulations for mixed marriages involving several faiths, and birth control issues. He opened the final session of the council, concelebrating with bishops from countries where the Church was persecuted. Several texts proposed for his approval had to be changed. But all texts were finally agreed upon. The Council was concluded on 8 December 1965, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What does the Catholic church considered \\"mixed\\" in a \\"mixed marriage\\"?","completion":"A \\"mixed marriage\\" in the context of the Catholic Church refers to a marriage between a Catholic and a non-Catholic individual. The non-Catholic partner can be a baptized Christian from another denomination, or a non-Christian (someone who follows other religions or has no religious affiliation). The Catholic Church has guidelines and regulations for mixed marriages to ensure that the religious beliefs of both parties are respected, and the Catholic partner remains loyal and supportive of the Catholic faith. In the past, the Catholic Church showed greater caution and concern regarding mixed marriages due to the potential risks in upholding and preserving the Catholic faith within such relationships. This concern stems from the challenges that could arise from differences in religious beliefs and practices, which might complicate the couple's commitment to raising their children in the Catholic tradition. Therefore, the Church has always preferred marriages between Catholics. However, the Church, recognizing the complex and diverse nature of modern society, allows mixed marriages under specific conditions. According to the 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 1124 declares that mixed marriages cannot take place without the necessary permission from the local ordinary, usually the bishop. The Catholic partner must obtain this permission, acknowledging their responsibility to preserve their faith and do all within their power to have their children baptized and raised as Catholics. The non-Catholic partner must be informed of these promises and intentions, and the Church emphasizes the importance of the couple's mutual respect for each other's beliefs. During the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), the Church discussed the need for a more pastoral approach to mixed marriages. In the reforms announced by Pope Paul VI, the Church acknowledged the need to revise regulations surrounding mixed marriages to address the challenges faced by couples in interfaith relationships. This revision sought to promote better understanding, respect, and cooperation between the Catholic Church and other Christian communities and non-Christian religions. In summary, the Catholic Church considers a marriage \\"mixed\\" when it involves a Catholic and a non-Catholic partner. The Church has regulations and guidelines in place to maintain the integrity of the Catholic faith within such marriages, but it also fosters a more pastoral and understanding approach to the diverse and complex nature of modern relationships."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Negative Yelp Review: Title: Disappointing Experience at the Hypothetical Café I rarely write reviews, but my recent experience at the Hypothetical Café has compelled me to share my disappointment. Being a popular spot in town, my expectations were high; however, the café failed to meet those standards on multiple levels, from the food and drinks to the service and atmosphere. Upon walking into the café, I immediately noticed the chipped and worn furniture and the overly cramped seating arrangement. The lack of attention to the café's ambiance was a red flag, but my friends and I still chose to give it a try. As we glanced over the menu, we initially found it quite extensive, offering a wide range of both sweet and savory options. Unfortunately, this excitement would not last long. After placing our orders, we started to experience issues with the service and staff. Our waiter took forever to bring our drinks and appeared disinterested, bordering on rude, when we tried to clarify a missing item. Furthermore, the regular water we'd requested showed up lukewarm, which was far from refreshing, and the coffee served to someone in my party tasted watered-down and almost stale. Moving on to the food, which was supposed to be the saving grace of this place. After waiting over 30 minutes for our orders to arrive, we were more than ready to dig in. One friend ordered Eggs Benedict and another chose the shrimp and avocado toast, while I opted for the highly recommended Hypothetical Burger. The Eggs Benedict was overcooked and dry, with a poorly seasoned hollandaise sauce. The shrimp and avocado toast was a disaster – the shrimp tasted as if it had been thawed improperly and the avocado was overly mashed with an off-putting texture. As for the Hypothetical Burger, I must say I was extremely let down. The burger was greasy and served on a soggy bun that fell apart halfway through eating it. The fries accompanying my meal were limp and could have used a second round in the fryer, and the coleslaw was drowning in dressing, rendering it far too rich to consume. I did address my concerns with the staff and management, but the response received was underwhelming and dismissive. To add insult to injury, the bill took a considerable amount of time to arrive and had errors, which required further waiting to sort out. In conclusion, the Hypothetical Café has left a poor taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively. As someone who truly appreciates good dining experiences and values customer service, I regret to say that I won't be returning to this establishment.

Q:Information: - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court. - The Visigoths were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread during the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD. - Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages in mainland Europe, the Mediterranean world, and the Middle East. The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235 284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire. - Theodoric I ( Gothic : Þiudareiks ; German : Theodorid or Theodorich ; Latin : Theodericus ) , ( c. 393 -- 20 June 451 ) called in Spanish , Portuguese and Italian Teodorico , was the Germanic King of the Visigoths from 418 to 451 AD . An illegitimate son of Alaric , Theodoric is famous for his part in defeating Attila at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451 , where he was killed . - The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (or Fields), also called the Battle of Châlons or the Battle of Maurica, took place on June 20, 451 AD between a coalition led by the Roman general Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic king Theodoric I against the Huns and their vassals commanded by their king Attila. It was one of the last major military operations of the Western Roman Empire, although Germanic foederati composed the majority of the coalition army. The battle was strategically inconclusive: the Romans stopped the Huns' attempt to establish vassals in Roman Gaul, and installed Merovech as king of the Franks. However, the Huns successfully looted and pillaged much of Gaul and crippled the military capacity of the Romans and Visigoths. The Hunnic Empire was later dismantled by a coalition of their Germanic vassals at the Battle of Nedao in 454. - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Alaric I (- \\"supreme chief/ruler\\" 370 (or 375)410 AD) was the first King of the Visigoths from 395410, son (or paternal grandson) of chieftain Rothestes. Alaric is best known for his sack of Rome in 410, which marked a decisive event in the decline of the Roman Empire. - The Goths were an East Germanic people, two of whose branches, the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths, played an important role in the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the emergence of Medieval Europe. The Goths dominated a vast area, which at its peak under the Germanic king Ermanaric and his sub-king Athanaric possibly extended all the way from the Danube to the Don, and from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. - Attila (or ; fl. circa 406453), frequently referred to as Attila the Hun, was the ruler of the Huns from 434 until his death in March 453. Attila was a leader of the Hunnic Empire, a tribal confederation consisting of Huns, Ostrogoths, and Alans among others, on the territory of Central and Eastern Europe. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - Merovech (Latin: \\"Meroveus\\" or \\"Merovius\\"; died 453/457) is the semi-legendary founder of the Merovingian dynasty of the Salian Franks (although Chlodio may in fact be the founder), which later became the dominant Frankish tribe. His name is close to \\"Marwig\\", lit. \\"famed fight\\" (compare modern Dutch \\"mare\\" \\"news, rumour\\" and \\"vermaard\\" \\"famous\\"). He is said to be one of several barbarian warlords and kings that joined forces with the Roman general Aetius against the Huns under Attila on the Catalaunian fields in Gaul. The first Frankish royal dynasty called themselves Merovingians (\\"descendants of Meroveus\\") after him, although no other historical evidence exists that Merovech ever lived.

Which language is this?","completion":"The language in the sentence, \\"Участниками конвенции являются 144 страны,\\" is Russian. Russian is an East Slavic language and an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It is also widely used, though unofficial, in many former Soviet countries such as Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia, and Estonia. Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the four living members of the East Slavic languages, the others being Belarusian, Ukrainian and Rusyn. Over the centuries, it has been influenced by and adopted words from many other languages, including Greek, Latin, Italian, French, German, and English. Written in the Cyrillic script, Russian has a lexicon of the Indo-European type. It also retains sizable Indo-European and Old East Slavic components in grammar and vocabulary. The Russian language was developed through a progression from Old East Slavic (9th to 14th centuries), through Middle East Slavic (14th to 15th centuries), to Modern Russian (late 17th century to the present). The sentence you provided in Russian, \\"Участниками конвенции являются 144 страны\\", translates in English as \\"144 countries are participants of the convention\\". In Russian grammar, the verb generally follows the noun in the sentence structure. Like other Slavic languages, Russian uses cases to show grammatical relationships between words in a sentence, which can be confusing to learners whose languages do not use cases. Russian is the eighth most spoken language in the world by number of native speakers and the seventh by total number of speakers. It’s one of the six official languages of the United Nations. So, the prior sentence is in Russian language, one of the prominent languages worldwide. Its right-to-left script, unique grammatical structures, and rich history make the Russian language an interesting field of study for linguists and language enthusiasts around the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Many people think that the ideas about right and wrong are only personal ideas. Bennett wrote The Book of Virtue in which he suggested that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett's book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values, just like honesty, courage, loyalty and many others. For Americans, one basic moral value is honesty. The story about George Washington and the cherry tree teaches this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favourite cherry tree. When his father asked him about it, George said, \\"I did it.\\" Instead of punishment, his father spoke highly of him. Sometimes American honesty--being open and direct--can make people angry. But Americans still believe that \\"honesty is the best virtue\\". Another virtue is perseverance . A story tells of a little train climbing a hill. The hill is too high to get over it. But the train just kept pulling, all the while saying, \\"I think I can, I think I can.\\" At last, the train was over the top because he did not give up. Compassion may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \\"The Good Samaritan\\" from the Bible describes a man with compassion. On his way home, he found a poor traveler lying on the road. The kind man, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need. Compassion can even turn into a good cycle. In 1992, people in Iowa sent plenty of water to help Floridians hit by storms. The next summer, during the Midwest flood, Florida returned. Millions of Americans are quietly passing along the kindness shown to them. In no way can this book cover all the moral values honored (...) by Americans. But moral virtues are priceless, and they are the base of American culture and any culture.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that said \\"Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\"? from the following article ? The album was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\". Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Comparative religion is the branch of the study of religions concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as ethics, metaphysics, and the nature and form of salvation. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the sacred, numinous, spiritual and divine. - Numinous is an English adjective, derived from the Latin \\"numen\\", meaning \\"arousing spiritual or religious emotion; mysterious or awe-inspiring\\". - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\" - Basic English is an English-based controlled language created by linguist and philosopher Charles Kay Ogden as an international auxiliary language, and as an aid for teaching English as a second language. Basic English is, in essence, a simplified subset of regular English.

Summarize: President Nicolas Maduro said the officer was killed by a sniper and branded the protesters \\"murderous\\". More than 240 people were arrested after the pre-dawn raids on four camps in the east of the capital. Since anti-government protests began in February, more than 40 people have been killed, and thousands more arrested. \\"A sniper killed the policeman while he was cleaning debris left by these violent, murderous protesters,\\" a sombre Mr Maduro said during a televised address. \\"He was vilely killed,\\" he added. Three other policemen were wounded, one by gunfire, Venezuelan media reported. Interior Minister Miguel Rodriguez said police had found \\"drugs, weapons, explosives and mortars\\" in the camps. The violence erupted after raids by members of the National Guard broke up four tent camps maintained by student activists. Hundreds of demonstrators poured on to the streets and set up barricades. Masked youths threw stones and petrol bombs, while police responded with tear gas. Witnesses said shots were fired from buildings into the streets, but this could not be confirmed. Mr Rodriguez said 243 protesters had been detained and that the authorities were currently determining whom to charge. He said protesters had used the camps as bases to launch \\"violent attacks\\", after which they would \\"hide... saying they were taking part in a peaceful protest\\". Earlier this week, the pressure group Human Rights Watch accused Venezuelan security forces of illegally detaining and abusing protesters. Demonstrations were triggered by frustration with Venezuela's high crime rates and poor economic situation but have grown into a wider anti-government movement.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After her sister Olga marries and leaves home, Katrin Koerber, the daughter of an Austrian medical professor, fights loneliness and dreams of a more exciting life outside Austria. Consequently, when Dr. Walter Fane, a British bacteriologist, asks her to marry him and move to Hong Kong, she agrees, even though she is not in love with him. As soon as the newlyweds arrive in Hong Kong, however, Walter becomes consumed with his medical work, and Katrin becomes the romantic target of Jack Townsend, the unhappily married attaché to the British embassy. While showing her the city's exotic sights, Jack flirts with Katrin and kisses her. Katrin, unnerved by Jack's actions, retreats to her house, but soon rejoins him to observe local dancers performing at a Buddhist festival. Stimulated by the dancing and the atmosphere of a Buddhist temple, Jack confesses his love to Katrin, and Katrin admits that she is not in love with Walter. At home, Katrin then treats Walter coolly and reveals that his chronic lateness and fatigue annoy her. To make amends, Walter comes home early the next day, but discovers Katrin's bedroom door locked and Jack's hat on a table. That evening, Walter confronts Katrin with his suspicions, and she admits that she loves Jack. Distraught, Walter tells Katrin that he will grant her a divorce only if Jack promises in writing that he will divorce his wife and marry her. When Katrin presents Walter's conditions to Jack, he tells her that a divorce would ruin both his career and his reputation and backs out of the affair. The answer is:","completion":"The profession of the person that Olga's sister, Katrin Koerber, is not in love with is a British bacteriologist. This fact is established based on the context given that states, \\"Dr. Walter Fane, a British bacteriologist, asks her to marry him and move to Hong Kong, she agrees, even though she is not in love with him.\\" Dr. Walter Fane gets consumed with his work upon their arrival in Hong Kong which causes a distance between them. Katrin is courted by Jack Townsend, an attaché to the British embassy, and she admits to him that she isn't in love with her husband, Walter. Despite the romantic advances of Jack Townsend, Katrin's lack of love concerns her husband, Dr. Walter Fane, the British bacteriologist.

Background: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Paragraph: Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend received more interferon? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Nigel received more interferon. Given the background information and the paragraph provided, we can determine that Nigel received more interferon due to his infection with the HIV virus. Interferon is a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected, particularly in response to a viral infection. Since Nigel was more prone to viral infections and got infected with HIV, his immune system would have produced more interferon to help combat the virus. On the other hand, Manny had a bacterial infection. Although interferon might have some activity against bacterial infections, its primary function is to combat viral infections. Therefore, it is more likely that Nigel, who was infected with a virus, received more interferon than Manny, who had a bacterial infection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Review: This film was not nearly as much of a chore as I expected it to be. There are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy paranoia-fest. Most of the acting is mediocre, but fairly typical for 1970s-style stuff replete with pregnant pauses. A photographer and a model witness some strange goings-on in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goings-on. Flying saucers are spotted, more people disappear - but is it the aliens or our own government's ultra-secret group of cover-up guys? Soon enough, a reporter and a \\"UFOlogist\\" (apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director) are drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultra-secret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless. Then the fun really begins. The movie, predictably, makes about as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be commended for taking itself so seriously. The camera work is OK for a low-budget film, the pacing is pretty good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for. What are the few seconds of brilliance I mentioned? Honestly, I can't say much you without writing a spoiler.

Really nice little place with great pizza and friendly staff. It's sit-down in the same way that Chipotle is sit-down. They serve wine and beer, but maybe I'm just not used to that in a non-table-service establishement. Unlike Osteria 100, the pizzas are a good size for lunch. The first time I went, a friend and I split a Ceasar salad and a Vesuvius pizza. Portions were fine for a light lunch. The second time I had one pizza myself. The dough quality is excellent - thin, toasted on the edges, and soft within. The taste is so fresh - much like Il Pizziaolo in Mt Lebo. I've since had the Quattro Formaggi and the Prosciutto y Fungi and both were great. This is a great addition to the downtown lunch scene. I hope they do well - the location is on the very edge of town - and nice to see that they are open past 3pm. Would be a cool happy hour place if they had a bar, but there's just no room for one. With the right wine list it would be kind of like having Dinette minutes from my office. Two downsides: 1. Noise! It's all hard surfaces, so conversations travel. In their defense, it's all glass on two sides, so no much you can do there. 2. THere is no vestibule, so on wintry days there are big chills rushing in with every patron.

A shooting guard, he initially achieved success playing professional basketball in Europe in the 1980s, before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1989. A star on multiple stages, Petrovic earned two silver medals and one bronze in Olympic basketball, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA World Cup, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA EuroBasket, and two EuroLeague titles. He represented Yugoslavia's national team and, later, Croatia's national team. Petrovic's national team debut came at the age of 15, at the Under-18 Balkan Championship in Turkey, where the Yugoslavian junior team won the bronze. The young man regularly played for the Yugoslavian national team in the Balkan Championships, also winning gold with the junior team and silver with the senior team. He also brought back the silver from the 1982 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship in Bulgaria. The 1984 Summer Olympics were Petrovic's first competition of a grand scale with the Yugoslav senior national team, and the bronze medal won in Los Angeles that summer became his first Olympic medal. Third place was also earned at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, remembered for the last minute thriller in the semi-final game against the Soviet Union. At the 1987 EuroBasket, Petrovic again returned with bronze, as Yugoslavia lost to the hosts and gold medalists Greece. The University Games, held in Zagreb in 1987, saw the Yugoslavian squad with Petrovic win the gold. In the 1988 Summer Olympics, Yugoslavia with Petrovic, earned 2nd place, as they lost once more to the Soviet powerhouse. An excellent club season with Real Madrid was topped by Petrovic's 1989 accomplishment with the Yugoslav national team: at the EuroBasket in Zagreb, the young Yugoslavian team went all the way, defeating Greece more than comfortably in the championship game. Petrovic was the tournament's second leading scorer and most valuable player. The very next year, the summer in between the two most frustrating seasons of his professional career, as he struggled for playing time with the Trail Blazers, Petrovic was again making history with the national team, as Yugoslavia became world champions, after beating the Soviet Union for the gold in Buenos Aires, at the 1990 FIBA World Championship.

Write a title for this article: WASHINGTON — At a Supreme Court argument on Wednesday about procedures in redistricting cases, the justices appeared to be trying to reconcile two conflicting impulses. They did not want to close the door entirely on challenges to gerrymandering, but they also did not want to be required to rule on them. Though the court has never rejected a voting district on the ground that it gave a political party an unconstitutional advantage, it has never ruled out that such a district might exist. On Wednesday, the court seemed inclined to endorse procedures that would at least treat such claims seriously by sending them to special three-judge courts created by a federal law for redistricting cases. But as the argument drew to a close, several justices voiced a competing concern — the law also allows direct appeals to the Supreme Court from rulings of the three-judge courts, meaning more work and less discretion for the justices. The case, Shapiro v. McManus, No. 14-990, is a challenge to Maryland’s 2011 congressional maps. Democrats, the challengers said, had gone to elaborate and unconstitutional lengths to create oddly shaped districts to favor their candidates. A single federal trial judge dismissed the case, saying it did not present issues serious enough to warrant convening a three-judge court. In the first part of the argument, several justices seemed to disagree. “They want to raise about as important a question as you can imagine,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer said of the challengers. “And if they are right, that would affect congressional districts and legislative districts throughout the nation.” The argument was unusually sleepy, lasting 47 minutes instead of the usual hour and going for long stretches without questions from the bench. As it neared the end, it took a turn, with justices raising concerns about their workload and their ability to shape their own docket. “There are a lot of cases that come up in three-judge district courts that would be the kind of case — I speak for myself, anyway — that we might” decide not to review if they arrived in the usual course, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said. “With the three-judge district court, no, we have to decide it on the merits.” Justice Breyer echoed that point. “If there is a set of cases where this court should be careful as to when and how and which it enters in which order,” he said, it is those involving sensitive political issues. “If we accept your view,” he told Michael D. Kimberly, a lawyer for the challengers, “we have to take immediately whatever variations on the theme of disproportionate gerrymandering, whatever order they happen to arise and whenever they happen to arise, because we have no choice.” Much of the discussion concerned how legally tenuous a claim had to be before single judges could act on their own. Chief Justice Roberts did not seem satisfied with the available distinctions, which he said created “an awfully fuzzy line” and gave no guidance to judges. Justice Elena Kagan said the category of cases in which a judge could act alone should be very narrow if the test is whether the court has jurisdiction to hear the case at all. “We’ve basically said that’s only when it’s completely ridiculous,” she said, one where “it’s just a laughingstock of a case.” Steven M. Sullivan, a lawyer for Maryland, created some confusion with a description of the sorts of cases so frivolous that any judge should be entitled to dismiss them. “It’s easy when it’s the little green men and the extraterrestrials,” he said. That was probably a reference to Justice David H. Souter’s dissent in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, a 2009 decision that made it easier to dismiss all kinds of lawsuits at the outset. (It is appropriate, Justice Souter wrote, to dismiss “claims about little green men, or the plaintiff’s recent trip to Pluto, or experiences in time travel.”) But the reference seemed lost on Justice Antonin Scalia, who asked several questions about how extraterrestrials figured in the case.

News article: Forget the avocado, here are the foods we’ll love to hate in 2016 The avocado’s ubiquity in 2015 was pretty strange, when you think about it, since there is evidence of avocado use dating from 10,000 BC in a cave in Coaxcatlan, Puebla, in Mexico. But try telling that to someone trying to Instagram their brunch without getting egg yolk all over their phone. The avocado has been done to death this year – along with articles about the avocado being done to death. An irony I am well aware of. This torrent of publicity for what is basically a delicious thing to eat, followed by a fierce backlash, is inexplicable if you’ve been quietly eating avocados for years. Related: Ripe and ready: how ‘evil geniuses’ got us hooked on avocados Let’s look at the positives. In many ways, the rise of the avocado in 2015 has been a welcome development. There are more of them around, for a start, and some of them are even ripe. You can get avocado on toast in places that aren’t London. I know, because I live somewhere that is not London. And when it comes to food trends, you know something’s gone mainstream when it rocks up in my town. But there are drawbacks too. Apparently, avocados were the most pinned food on Pinterest this year. Just writing that sentence makes me hate humanity. The ludicrous idea that they’re a butter substitute emerged. See “brownies” made from avocados, apple sauce and coconut flour. And we saw the advent of avocado tattoos. You really have seen it all when you’ve seen someone sporting a tattoo of a haunted avocado. All these things and, of course, the final straw – Nigella Lawson’s championing of avocado on toast on Simply Nigella. I love Nigella. I love avocados. But although her avocado on toast contains dill (no), lime, chilli flakes and radish, avocado on toast is most definitely not a recipe. Even Nigella had to admit this. But unfortunately she added that avocado on toast was “part of the fabric of my life”. There are plenty of contenders for trendy foods we can all become incredibly annoyed by in 2016 People just sick to death of the whole thing (the whole enchilada, if you will – a dish, of course, that is perfect with avocado) have suggested that the smug and ubiquitous avocado should be left behind in 2015. But rather than turn our backs on this delectable food, how about we simply enjoy avocados and stop plastering pictures of them all over social media? After all, there are plenty of contenders for trendy foods we can all become incredibly annoyed by in 2016: Drinking vinegars with a venerable history. Shrubs are more delicious than they sound, but have inexplicably started appearing in hipster hangouts in New York and London – see the Shrub and Shutter restaurant in Brixton. Homemade of course. And peanuts simply won’t do. Almonds. Cashews. Pecans. The more expensive the better. You will fall into ruinous penury and break your blender trying to make this at home. And then you will go to the supermarket and buy a jar of Sun-Pat. Slimy in its raw state, brittle in its packaged, dried form, quickly turning limp. Umami. Already in Marks & Spencer biscuits. What do you do with it? No one knows. But you’ll buy it anyway. Fermented tea drink people say tastes fantastic. They are lying. Health benefits, apparently. Kombucha tea bars are “popping up” at places such as Mick’s Garage in Hackney, London, says the trendiest food blogger in the world, Clerkenwell Boy. I’m so untrendy I thought that might be an actual garage. So I Googled it. Then I had a little cry. The good news is that said bar offers it as a mixer for spirits. And if there’s one thing that’s comfortingly impervious to aggravating food trends, it’s good old hard liquor. Cheers. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The news article takes a humorous and slightly cynical look at the popularity of certain food trends in 2015, with a particular focus on avocados. Avocados became tremendously popular in 2015, showing prominence across social media, and seemingly appearing in every possible dish or recipe. This was bolstered by celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, who included the avocado on toast in her television show, despite her own admission that it wasn't a recipe but \\"part of the fabric of her life\\". The author finds this rampant trend tiresome and mocks its prominence on platforms like Pinterest and the array of strange ways avocados are being used, from being a butter substitute in brownies to the trend of getting avocado tattoos. The author suggests enjoying avocados without the need to constantly share them on social media. Additionally, the author speculates on potential upcoming food trends for the year 2016. This includes shrubs or drinking vinegars that are becoming popular in hipster locations in New York and London, and the surge of homemade nut butter, where almonds, cashews, and pecans are preferred over traditional peanuts. Other predicted trends include the utilization of kelp, a type of seaweed, and kombucha tea, a fermented drink, praised for its health benefits but criticized by the author for its taste. In summary, the news article is a satirical critique of food trends, focusing primarily on the overexposure and exhaustion of avocados in 2015, with a prediction on the possible new trends in 2016, like shrubs, homemade nut butter, kelp, and kombucha."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

These protests are in direct response to the mounting issue of funding cuts, which students and faculty alike believe have hampered the quality of education and services provided at their institutions. Step 1: Understand the issue The main source of discontent stems from the drastic budget cuts to higher education made by both federal and state governments over the past few years. As a result, colleges and universities have been forced to adjust their budgets, often at the expense of essential programs, services, and support staff. This has led to students and faculty members experiencing increased financial pressure, decreased resources, and limited opportunities. Step 2: Research and gather information Various public sources have reported that funding for higher education has been on a steady decline in the US. This is especially alarming as it comes at a time when college tuition continues to rise, student debt has escalated, and a greater emphasis is being placed on the importance of higher education for future success. Step 3: Highlight the impact of funding cuts The consequences of reduced funding are manifold: colleges and universities have to grapple with minimized support for research, infrastructure, and student services. Additionally, many educational institutions have been forced to implement hiring freezes, furlough faculty and staff members, and even cancel or postpone academic programs. Step 4: Describe the protests and what they aim to achieve In response to these adverse effects, students, faculty, and staff have started organizing and participating in raucous protests on their campuses. Their main objective is to oppose these funding cuts and bring attention to the deteriorating state of the American higher education system. Protesters hope that their actions will prompt a reevaluation of budgeting priorities, with the goal of reestablishing financial security for colleges and universities. Step 5: Address the potential outcomes of the protests While it is challenging to predict the precise outcomes of these rowdy demonstrations, the sheer number and intensity of the protesters cannot be ignored. It is possible that the public outcry will push policymakers to rethink their funding strategies and reconsider the importance of investing in higher education for both individual and societal prosperity. In conclusion, the recent surge of rowdy protests at US campuses offers a glimpse into the frustrations and concerns faced by those directly affected by the funding cuts in higher education. As the battle for resources and support continues, it remains to be seen whether these demonstrations will bring about the desired change and secure a brighter future for students, educators, and institutions alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who is the brother of the mutated wizard? Earth has been devastated by a nuclear war instigated by five terrorists, and it has taken two million years for the radioactive clouds to once again allow sunlight to reach the surface. Only a handful of humans have survived the apocalypse, while the rest have changed into mutants who roam the radioactive wastelands. Eventually, humanity's true ancestors – fairies, elves and dwarves – resurfaced and live in the idyllic land of Montagar in peace for three millennia. While her people celebrated 3,000 years of peace, their ruler Delia, queen of the fairies, fell into a trance and left the party. Puzzled, the fairies followed her to her home and discover that she has given birth to twin wizards. They were the kindhearted Avatar who spent much of his boyhood entertaining his ailing mother with beautiful visions and his mutated brother Blackwolf, who was pure-evil, never visiting his mother, but spending his time torturing small animals. When Blackwolf learned of their mother's death, he attempted to usurp her leadership, being defeated in duel against a grief-stricken Avatar. Blackwolf left Montagar with a vow to return and \\"make this a planet where mutants rule\\". Years later, Blackwolf has risen to lead the dark land of Scortch, where he and his vast army of goblins, ogres, and mutants salvage and restore ancient technology. He tries to attack Montagar twice, but is foiled both times when his mutant warriors become bored or sidetracked in the midst of battle.

Please answer the following question: Rob is experimenting with how air pressure works. To that end, he has designed two tests. In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations. Would case A have faster or slower air flow above it than case B? Answer:","completion":"To answer Rob's question, let's first discuss the key differences between an airplane wing and a race car spoiler. Then we can determine how air flow would behave above each of these and whether case A would have a faster or slower air flow compared to case B. Case A: Airplane Wing Airplane wings are designed to create lift, which allows the plane to fly. This is achieved through a concept called the Bernoulli principle. The wing is shaped in an airfoil manner, with the upper part of the wing being curved and the lower part being relatively flat. When air flows around the wing, it splits into two streams - one that travels above the wing and one that travels below it. Due to the curved design of the wing, the air moving on the upper surface has to travel a longer distance than the air on the lower surface. According to the Bernoulli principle, an increase in the speed of a fluid (in this case, air) results in a decrease in pressure. As a result, the air flow above the wing is faster than the air flow below it, creating a lower pressure area above the wing. The higher pressure below the wing pushes the airplane upward, generating lift. Case B: Race Car Spoiler A race car spoiler, on the other hand, is designed to improve the car's handling and traction at high speeds by reducing lift and increasing downforce. Downforce refers to the force exerted on a vehicle that pushes it downwards towards the ground, improving the car's grip on the road and ensuring better stability. A spoiler works by disrupting the air flow around the car, creating turbulence and a high pressure area above the spoiler. In this case, the air flow above the spoiler is inherently slower due to the spoilers design, which is to create high pressure. This is contrary to wing of an airplane, where the objective is to create lift based on differences in air pressure. Comparison and Conclusion: Comparing case A (airplane wing) and case B (race car spoiler), we can see that the primary difference lies in the purpose of each design. An airplane wing is designed to create lift by generating a low pressure area above the wing with faster air flow, whereas a race car spoiler aims to increase downforce and stability with a high pressure area above it due to slower air flow. Therefore, based on the principles of Bernoulli and the design objectives of each case, the air flow above case A (airplane wing) would indeed be faster than the air flow above case B (race car spoiler)."},{"prompt":"Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt until thoroughly combined. In a separate large mixing bowl, cream together 1/2 cup (1 stick) of unsalted, softened butter and 1 cup of granulated sugar using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes on medium-high speed. Add 2 large room-temperature eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition to ensure they are fully incorporated. Add 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and mix until combined. Next, gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with 1/2 cup of whole milk. Begin and end with the flour mixture to ensure a smooth batter. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cupcakes. Fold in any additional flavorings or mix-ins (such as chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or fruit) if desired. Using a cookie scoop or a spoon, evenly distribute the cupcake batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each liner about 2/3 full to allow for rising during baking. Gently tap the muffin tin on the counter to release any air bubbles and ensure a consistent rise. Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Keep an eye on the cupcakes to ensure they do not overbake, as this will result in dry and crumbly cupcakes. Once the cupcakes are baked, remove the muffin tin from the oven and allow it to cool on a wire cooling rack for around 5 minutes. After this time, carefully remove the individual cupcakes from the tin and place them directly on the cooling rack to cool completely. This will prevent the cupcakes from becoming soggy as they cool. While the cupcakes are cooling, prepare your desired frosting. Popular options include buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or even a simple dusting of powdered sugar. Once the cupcakes have cooled completely, use a piping bag and a decorative tip to create beautiful swirls of frosting or simply spread the frosting on top with a knife or an offset spatula. Finally, add any additional decorations such as sprinkles, edible glitter, or fondant shapes if desired.

Rockefeller had a lifelong association with the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) when he joined as a director in 1949. In 1965, Rockefeller and other businessmen formed the Council of the Americas to stimulate and support economic integration in the Americas. In 1992, at a Council sponsored forum, Rockefeller proposed a \\"Western Hemisphere free trade area\\", which became the Free Trade Area of the Americas in a Miami summit in 1994. His and the Council's chief liaison to President Bill Clinton in order to garner support for this initiative was through Clinton's chief of staff, Mack McLarty, whose consultancy firm Kissinger McLarty Associates is a corporate member of the Council, while McLarty himself is on the board of directors. He was also a trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, including 1948, when Alger Hiss was president. Displeased with the refusal of Bilderberg Group meetings to include Japan, Rockefeller helped found the Trilateral Commission in July 1973. Which policy group was considered the most important?","completion":"The most important policy group mentioned in the article is the Trilateral Commission. It was founded by David Rockefeller in July 1973, as he was displeased with the refusal of the Bilderberg Group meetings to include Japan. The Trilateral Commission played a significant role in fostering cooperation and policy coordination among the three major industrialized regions of the world: North America, Western Europe, and Japan. The formation of this group indicates the importance of collaboration among these powerful regions for global policymaking and highlights Rockefeller's efforts in shaping international relations and promoting economic integration."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

В процессе разучивания и шлифования программ, в ходе различного уровня зачетов, прокатов и соревнований, при удачах и неудачах у фигуристов едва ли не ежедневно возникают конфликты с собой, с партнером, с тренером, с хореографом, со школьными преподавателями, с родителями и т.д. и т.п. каждый из этих конфликтов ложится еще одним камнем на душу юного существа, и задача психолога - постоянно избавлять спортсмена Translate to English English:","completion":"During the process of learning and polishing programs, in the course of various levels of assessments, rentals, and competitions, with successes and failures, figure skaters almost daily face conflicts with themselves, with a partner, with a coach, with a choreographer, with school teachers, with parents, etc. Each of these conflicts lays another stone on the soul of a young individual, and the task of a psychologist is to constantly relieve the athlete. In the world of figure skating, it is natural for conflicts to arise due to the high-pressure environment, differing expectations, and the need for constant improvement. This makes it essential for athletes to have access to psychological support in order to navigate these challenges effectively. When faced with conflicts, it is important for skaters to maintain open communication and understanding with all parties involved. This includes discussing any concerns, acknowledging differing perspectives, and working together to find a solution that benefits everyone. A psychologist can help facilitate these conversations and mediate any disputes that may arise. Additionally, a psychologist can help athletes develop emotional resilience in order to cope with the inevitable challenges that come with being a competitive figure skater. This involves teaching them about self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Building these competencies can help skaters respond more effectively to conflicts and reduce the lasting impact they might have on their mental wellbeing. Moreover, a psychologist can provide athletes with strategies to help them manage performance anxiety, which is a common issue faced by figure skaters. This might include relaxation techniques, visualization exercises, or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help challenge negative thoughts and beliefs. By overcoming performance anxiety, skaters can enhance their focus, improve their overall performance, and, in turn, experiencing fewer conflicts within their sport environment. It is also crucial for coaches, choreographers, and other support staff to be aware of the potential conflicts that can arise in the competitive figure skating world. They should work collaboratively with athletes and their families to create a supportive and inclusive environment, promoting positive interactions and fostering mutual respect. By doing this, they can help minimize conflicts and create a more positive atmosphere for everyone involved. In conclusion, the role of a psychologist in competitive figure skating is multifaceted, involving conflict resolution, emotional resilience development, performance anxiety management, and fostering a supportive environment. By continually addressing these aspects, psychologists can help athletes navigate conflicts and reach their full potential in their sport."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the TV sitcom 'Friends' what is the name of Phoebe's twin sister?","completion":"In the popular TV sitcom 'Friends,' Phoebe Buffay's twin sister is named Ursula Buffay. Ursula is portrayed by the same actress, Lisa Kudrow. Ursula Buffay is a recurring character on 'Friends' and her storyline significantly intertwines with Phoebe's. She is also a character on the show 'Mad About You,' which aired around the same time as 'Friends.' Ursula was initially introduced on 'Mad About You' before her character was adapted into the 'Friends' storyline as Phoebe's twin sister. This crossover brought an interesting connection between the two popular TV shows. As for the characters themselves, both Phoebe and Ursula have strikingly different personalities. Phoebe is an eccentric, kind-hearted, and somewhat naive individual who is known for her quirky behavior, odd sense of humor, and unique approach to life. She works as a freelance masseuse and a musician, often performing original songs at Central Perk, the gang's favorite coffee shop hangout. On the other hand, Ursula is quite the opposite; she is portrayed as an extremely nonchalant, carefree, and self-centered person who displays little concern for others. She frequently forgets people's names, including her sister's, and generally makes a minimal effort to form relationships or even engage in basic conversations. Ursula works as a waitress at Riff's, a restaurant in 'Mad About You,' and later as a pornographic film actress (under Phoebe's name) in 'Friends.' Throughout the 'Friends' series, Ursula's appearances often lead to tension-filled encounters and awkward situations with Phoebe and the rest of the group. The two sisters have a rocky relationship due to their conflicting personalities and contrasting outlooks on life. However, these interactions add an interesting dynamic, humor, and depth to Phoebe's character and contribute to the overall appeal of the show."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

A family doctor and father-of-three was jailed today for seriously injuring two people while over the drink-drive limit. Gwyn Haydn Roberts, 45, from Abergavenny, drank one-and-a-half litres of cider and two cans of Special Brew after a visit to his sick mother in Gwynedd ended in a row. Mold Crown Court heard he drove on the wrong side of the road and went around bends on a grass verge on the A487. The doctor cried in the dock as he admitted causing serious injuries by dangerous driving. He was banned from driving for four years. The court heard how Roberts paid a visit to his sick mother in Criccieth on June 17, which ended in a row. Roberts - who was previously disqualified from driving for 27 months in 2010 for drink driving – drove on the wrong side of the road as he motored along the A487. The journey home was a 120-mile trip that would have taken an able driver around three hours. The crash happened between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd when Roberts crossed a double white line and hit a car driven by Indian restaurant workers Babel Mia and passenger Raj Mia. Both cars were written off in the collision and Babel Mia suffered a broken right foot, deep cuts to the head and knees. He was in hospital two days. His colleague suffered broken ribs, cuts and bruises. Roberts, a father of three, suffered a fractured sternum. Blood tests taken from Roberts four hours later showed he had 180 miligrammes of alcohol in his blood compared to the legal limit of 80. The crash happened between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd (pictured) Father-of-three Roberts - who was previously disqualified from driving for 27 months in 2010 for drink driving – drove on the wrong side of the road as he motored along the A487 between in Gwynedd, north-west Wales. Anna Pope, defending, said Roberts was receiving treatment for his alcohol addicition and Wynford Ellis Owen had written the report on his treatment. He had gone to Criccieth to visit his ageing mother who was seriously ill with bowel cancer. But there were emotional and mental issues from his childhood which came to the surface and they triggered his decision to drive home. Miss Pope said: 'He takes responsibility for what he did and made frank admissions. 'It is clear from the references there is another side to this man. He is an extremely successful GP valued by his patients. 'He is a loving husband and father to three children. He is also an extremely troubled man throughout his adult life,' she said. The issues from his childhood had driven him to drink and prescription drugs, although there was no suggestion that had affected his work. Miss Pope said his first drink drive offence happened when he had driven to the Black Mountains to commit suicide but could not go through with it. He was arrested as he drove back and was found to be over the limit. He had been detained for a short while under the Mental Health Act and had referred himself for residential rehabilitation. He was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and Miss Pope said he should be spared jail to allow his rehabilitation to continue. The journey the doctor wanted to take was a 120-mile trip that would have taken around three hours. But Judge Rhys Rowlands said the decision to try and drive 130 miles plus along 'tortuous roads' was 'extraordinarily dangerous'. He pointed out that he must have known full-well what he was doing was illegal. 'You were placing other road users at risk and sadly that is what happened. You were driving at speed, on the wrong side of the road and around bends, prompting one motorist to film it and another motorist described your overtaking as the most dangerous she had seen. You could easily have killed those in the other car. 'I have read letters from professional colleagues and patients you have assisted over the years. Professionally you are highly thought of and you have taken steps to try and address your drinking. You are the sole provider for a young family and the effect has been profound on them.' He sentenced Roberts to 27 months in jail and disqualified him from driving for four years. The General Medical Council will consider the future of Dr Gwyn Haydn Roberts in January, but Mold Crown Court was told he was unlikely to practise medicine again.

Summarize the following: Organize your obligations into “Do,” “Don’t Do,” and “Delegate.” Instead of trying to do it all, figure out which household tasks need to be done (your “Do” list), and which can wait (your “Don’t Do” list). If there are things you could get your partner, your kids, or a hired hand to do – washing the dishes, walking the dog, and so on – separate them into your “Delegate” list. This will rebalance your family’s time in such a way that you all have the ability to spend more time together, instead of you and/or your partner taking on a disproportionate amount of housework. Be realistic and honest when evaluating your time. Don’t add something to your “Do” list just because you feel guilty. Organize your work tasks, too, so that you can identify which things need doing and which you can delegate to a coworker. You can lose a lot of time that can be spent with your family (or on yourself) by searching for misplaced keys, remote controls, and other essential belongings. Choose a convenient location for your wallet or purse, your keys, and your glasses. Get in the habit of placing these essentials – especially the things you seem to lose frequently – in the same place every day. For instance, you might choose to always put your glasses by the bedside, and your keys by the door. Look for ways to save time and use them whenever possible. For instance, if your dry cleaner offers free pickup, or you can get your pizza delivered instead of picking it up, spring for these convenience services. This will help you maximize your family time. If you’re enrolled in university, use the campus gym instead of trekking from school to the gym and then home. If you’re the type of person who rises to a challenge, you might benefit from trying to make and meet unique family-related goals. Set a minimum amount of time to spend with your family each week – for instance, 15 hours. Or you could try a qualitative goal like making your child smile at dinner. Change your family-time goals regularly to keep the contest fresh. Instead of checking email, working on projects, and texting friends or coworkers when you’re home, turn your phone off and shut down your computer. This way, your family will get your undivided attention. After your kids and partner are asleep, you can log back on. This is especially important during family outings and meals. You can also use your computer and phone early in the morning, when your kids and partner are asleep. Some people get discouraged because they think, “I could never maximize my family time in the way that my neighbor did.” This is defeatist thinking and will not help you maximize your family time. Instead, organize your time as well a possible without passing judgment on yourself. Remember, nobody can spend all their time with their family. Summary:","completion":"To make more time for your family, make three lists: \\"Do,\\" \\"Don't Do,\\" and \\"Delegate.\\" Put important tasks on the \\"Do\\" list, tasks that can wait on the \\"Don't Do\\" list, and tasks others can help with on the \\"Delegate\\" list. Always put things like keys and glasses in the same place so you don't waste time looking for them. Use services that save time, like free pickup or delivery. Set family goals to have more fun together. Turn off your phone and computer when you're with your family, and only use them when your family is asleep.

His ability to captivate readers with engaging content seemed almost effortless. Whether it was a news piece, an opinion column, or a well-researched article, Hunter managed to deliver high-quality writing consistently, never failing to surprise his audience with his unique perspective. On the other hand, Kyle struggled with his writing. Unlike Hunter, Kyle seemed unable to communicate his ideas effectively on paper. He faced numerous challenges, ranging from difficulties organizing his thoughts to an inability to find the right words to express his feelings or arguments. Kyle's struggles were not due to a lack of effort. He was determined to improve, and often spent hours researching and re-writing each piece he worked on, trying to make his articles more engaging and informative. It was as if every sentence was a struggle for him, a battle to find the right way to communicate his point. Nevertheless, Kyle remained committed to improving his writing abilities. He consistently sought feedback from his peers, took writing courses, and looked to Hunter for guidance. Slowly but surely, he began to see small improvements in his work.

Jessica Rich and FTC staff will be available to take questions from the media about the case. In a complaint filed today, the Federal Trade Commission is charging mobile phone service provider T-Mobile USA, Inc., with making hundreds of millions of dollars by placing charges on mobile phone bills for purported “premium” SMS subscriptions that, in many cases, were bogus charges that were never authorized by its customers. The FTC alleges that T-Mobile received anywhere from 35 to 40 percent of the total amount charged to consumers for subscriptions for content such as flirting tips, horoscope information or celebrity gossip that typically cost 9.99 per month. According to the FTC’s complaint, T-Mobile in some cases continued to bill its customers for these services offered by scammers years after becoming aware of signs that the charges were fraudulent. Excerpts from an actual T-Mobile bill showing cramming charges. (click to view full-size) “It’s wrong for a company like T-Mobile to profit from scams against its customers when there were clear warning signs the charges it was imposing were fraudulent,” said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez. “The FTC’s goal is to ensure that T-Mobile repays all its customers for these crammed charges.” In a process known as “third-party billing,” a phone company places charges on a consumer’s bill for services offered by another company, often receiving a substantial percentage of the amount charged. When the charges are placed on the bill without the consumer’s authorization, it is known as “cramming.” The FTC’s complaint alleges that in some cases, T-Mobile was charging consumers for services that had refund rates of up to 40 percent in a single month. The FTC has alleged that because such a large number of people were seeking refunds, it was an obvious sign to T-Mobile that the charges were never authorized by its customers. As the complaint notes, the refund rate likely significantly understates the percentage of consumers who were crammed. The complaint also states that internal company documents show that T-Mobile had received a high number of consumer complaints at least as early as 2012. The FTC has made significant efforts to end mobile cramming. In the last year, in addition to holding a public workshop on mobile cramming, the Commission has filed several lawsuits against alleged mobile cramming operations Jesta Digital, Wise Media, and Tatto Inc. According to today’s complaint, T-Mobile billed its customers for the services of these FTC defendants as well as an operation sued by the Texas Attorney General. The complaint against T-Mobile alleges that the company’s billing practices made it difficult for consumers to detect that they were being charged, much less by whom. When consumers viewed a summary of their T-Mobile bill online, according to the complaint, it did not show consumers that they were being charged by a third party, or that the charge was part of a recurring subscription. The heading under which the charges would be listed, “Premium Services,” could only be seen after clicking on a separate heading called “Use Charges.” Even after clicking, though, consumers still could not see the individual charges. The complaint also alleges that T-Mobile’s full phone bills, which can be longer than 50 pages, made it nearly impossible for consumers to find and understand third-party subscription charges. After looking past a “Summary” section as well as an “Account Service Detail” section, both of which described “Usage Charges” but did not itemize those charges, a consumer might then reach the section labeled “Premium Services,” where the crammed items would be listed. According to the complaint, the information would be listed there in an abbreviated form, such as “8888906150BrnStorm23918,” that did not explain that the charge was for a recurring third-party subscription supposedly authorized by the consumer. In addition, the complaint notes that consumers who use pre-paid calling plans do not receive monthly bills, and as a result the subscription fee was debited from their pre-paid account without their knowledge. When consumers were able to determine they were being charged for services they hadn’t ordered, the complaint alleges that T-Mobile in many cases failed to provide consumers with full refunds. Indeed, the FTC charged that T-Mobile refused refunds to some customers, offering only partial refunds of two months’ worth of the charges to others, and in other cases instructed consumers to seek refunds directly from the scammers – without providing accurate contact information to do so. The complaint also notes that in some cases, T-Mobile claimed that consumers had authorized the charges despite having no proof of consumers doing so. The FTC’s complaint seeks a court order to permanently prevent T-Mobile from engaging in mobile cramming and to obtain refunds for consumers and disgorgement of T-Mobile’s ill-gotten gains. The FTC thanks the Federal Communications Commission and its Enforcement Bureau for their invaluable assistance with and close cooperation and coordination in this matter. The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint was 5-0. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.

The response from T-Mobile CEO John Legere isn’t exactly what you would describe as contrite. “We have seen the complaint filed today by the FTC and find it to be unfounded and without merit,” writes Legere. “In fact T-Mobile stopped billing for these Premium SMS services last year and launched a proactive program to provide full refunds for any customer that feels that they were charged for something they did not want.” So there you go, America. T-Mobile shouldn’t be sued for something it made a mountain of money from because it is no longer making that mountain of money and it’s offering refunds to customers who “feel” they were charged for something they didn’t order. Legere — who struts around in a leather coat, crashing his competitors’ parties, has a history of making grandiose statements about his company and blatantly mocking his much bigger competitors, and who recently used the word “rape” in reference to AT&T and Verizon — calls the FTC suit “sensationalized,” which is a bit like Bob Hope calling Bing Crosby dead. Legere comes across like the snotty teen who got caught doing something wrong and then cops an attitude when he’s told that “I’m no longer doing it” does not wipe away the transgression. In speaking with reporters after today’s announcement, Jessica Rich, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, explained that the agency “did engage in settlement negotiations with T-Mobile, but were not able to reach a settlement.” Here is the entire statement from Legere, presented in appropriately colored text: We have seen the complaint filed today by the FTC and find it to be unfounded and without merit. In fact T-Mobile stopped billing for these Premium SMS services last year and launched a proactive program to provide full refunds for any customer that feels that they were charged for something they did not want. T-Mobile is fighting harder than any of the carriers to change the way the wireless industry operates and we are disappointed that the FTC has chosen to file this action against the most pro-consumer company in the industry rather than the real bad actors. As the Un-carrier, we believe that customers should only pay for what they want and what they sign up for.” said John Legere, CEO T Mobile USA. “We exited this business late last year, and announced an aggressive program to take care of customers and we are disappointed that the FTC has instead chosen to file this sensationalized legal action. We are the first to take action for the consumer, I am calling for the entire industry to do the same. This is about doing what is right for consumers and we put in place procedures to protect our customers from unauthorized charges. Unfortunately, not all of these third party providers acted responsibly—an issue the entire industry faced. We believe those providers should be held accountable, and the FTC’s lawsuit seeking to hold T-Mobile responsible for their acts is not only factually and legally unfounded, but also misdirected. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — T-Mobile USA knowingly made hundreds of millions off its customers in bogus charges, a federal regulator alleged Tuesday in a complaint likely to damage the reputation of a household name in wireless communications. In its complaint filed in federal court, the Federal Trade Commission claimed that T-Mobile billed consumers for subscriptions to premium text services such as 10-per-month horoscopes that were never authorized by the account holder. The FTC alleges that T-Mobile collected as much as 40 percent of the charges, even after being alerted by other customers that the subscriptions were scams. \\"It's wrong for a company like T-Mobile to profit from scams against its customers when there were clear warning signs the charges it was imposing were fraudulent,\\" said FTC Chair Edith Ramirez. \\"The FTC's goal is to ensure that T-Mobile repays all its customers for these crammed charges.\\" The practice is often referred to as \\"cramming\\": businesses stuff a customer's bill with bogus charges associated with a third party. In this case, the FTC says T-Mobile should have realized that many of these premium text services were scams because of the high rate of customer complaints. But while as many as 40 percent of customers demanded refunds, others didn't notice the charges. Headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, T-Mobile USA, Inc., is a publicly traded company. According to its website, Deutsche Telekom AG maintains a 67 percent ownership in the company's common stock. |||||Summary:","completion":"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against T-Mobile USA in 2014, alleging that the mobile phone service provider made hundreds of millions of dollars by placing charges on mobile phone bills for premium SMS subscriptions without customer authorization. The FTC claimed that T-Mobile received between 35% to 40% of the total amount charged to consumers for subscriptions, and continued billing customers for these services even after becoming aware of the fraudulent charges. The FTC aimed to ensure T-Mobile repaid affected customers for these charges. T-Mobile CEO John Legere, in response, called the FTC suit \\"unfounded and without merit\\" and stated T-Mobile had stopped billing for premium SMS services and began offering refunds to customers who felt they had been charged for unwanted services."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick the answer from these options Available options: (i). the interaction between abiotic factors (ii). the effects of chemical weathering (iii). the process of deposition (iv). the effects of abrasion","completion":"To determine the correct answer, we need to evaluate the given situation and understand the relationship between lichens and the rock. Lichens grow on the rock surface, and the breakdown of rock underneath the lichen suggests a chemical or physical change taking place. Let's analyze step-by-step: 1. Lichens consist of a combination of fungi and algae, which are living organisms. 2. The rock surface is a non-living, natural material. 3. Lichens are known to secrete acids that break down rock surfaces to obtain essential mineral nutrients. 4. The breakdown of the rock surface due to lichen growth is a common phenomenon. Now let's evaluate the options: (i). the interaction between abiotic factors - This option refers to the interaction between non-living factors, which is not applicable in this case, as lichens are living organisms. (ii). the effects of chemical weathering - This option discusses the chemical changes that result in decomposition or disintegration of rock material. Since lichens secrete acids that break down rock surfaces, this option aligns with the given scenario. (iii). the process of deposition - Deposition refers to the process of sediment particles settling and accumulating over time. This option is not relevant to the current situation, as the rock is breaking down, not accumulating particles. (iv). the effects of abrasion - Abrasion refers to the physical wearing down of a surface due to friction or impact. In this case, the breakdown is a result of chemical actions, not physical forces.

That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states.

News article: This post has been corrected, as noted below. It was Kyndall Jack's screams that ultimately led to her rescue, officials said Thursday. The 18-year-old, who had been missing in Orange County's Trabuco Canyon since Easter Sunday, was airlifted off a rugged hillside Thursday morning and transported to UCI Medical Center in Orange, officials said. Rescuers reached the woman Thursday morning after a hiker alerted rescue teams of the sounds of a woman screaming near Falls Canyon. Officials said she was about half a mile from where she and a friend, Nicolas Cendoya, parked their car Sunday. Photos: The search for missing hikers “She is responsive, appears to be dehydrated, she is weak,” said Lt. Jason Park of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. “She’s alive, she’s conscious and she’s being transported.” Park described the operation as a difficult rescue because of the steep terrain. One of the volunteer reserve deputies involved in the search for Jack suffered a head injury after a fall and was being taken to another area hospital. Capt. John Muir of the Orange County Fire Authority said that when Jack’s parents were told she had been found, “they cried, they hugged us, they thanked us immensely.\\" \\"This is a good outcome,\\" he told reporters. \\"This is why we do what we do.” Crews had scoured the difficult terrain since Sunday evening, when Cendoya and Jack called authorities on a cellphone and said they were lost. Cendoya, 19, was found dehydrated and disoriented on Wednesday night, about half a mile from the parked car off a gravel road that had been traversed by search crews. Rescuers had to slash through thick brush to get to Cendoya, who was wearing board shorts and a shirt but did not have shoes, Park said. Cendoya's arms and legs were covered in scratches, officials said. He was rushed to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where he arrived in \\"very serious\\" condition, Dr. Michael Ritter said. Ritter said Thursday that Cendoya was responding well to treatment and would probably be released in a few days. Cendoya's rescue reinvigorated crews searching for Jack, authorities said Thursday morning. Ritter said Cendoya told him the pair had been \\"hiking around\\" Sunday when night fell and they somehow became separated. Cendoya said that was the last time he saw Jack, the doctor said. Cendoya covered himself with brush to keep warm, Ritter said. He also prayed. \\"Nick said the thing that kept him going was praying,\\" Ritter told reporters. \\"He said he would pray every day and every night to give him the strength to get out of there.\\" [For the record, 3:40 p.m. April 4: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that UC Irvine Medical Center is in Irvine; it is in Orange.] ALSO: Groups sue to block Wal-Mart grocery from opening in Chinatown Mother accused of drowning two daughters commits suicide in jail Sex offender says being student body president helps him 'move on' ||||| A teenage girl who has been lost in a California canyon since Sunday was found today clinging to the side of a steep cliff and shouting for help, authorities said.

The hiker who spotted Cendoya went for help and found firefighters on an unrelated mission nearby. A helicopter brought Cendoya to Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, where he was listed in serious condition. Cendoya was located about a half-mile south of where much of the search had focused. Rescue crews worked through the night, scouring the rough terrain in hopes of finding Jack. Several dozen searchers with help from helicopters had been combing the rugged hills of Trabuco Canyon. Two volunteers got lost themselves and had to be airlifted out Wednesday. They were searching the area because the Sunday 911 call was traced to a nearby cell tower, Orange County Fire Authority Capt. John Muir said. The two were believed to have gone off trail near Holy Jim Trail, a tree-lined dirt path along a creek that leads to a waterfall and is popular with day hikers. In the 911 call, they said they were about a mile from Jack's car, which was parked at a trailhead, but rescuers expanded the search when they weren't found nearby. The area is in a section of the national forest in the Santa Ana Mountains, which lie along the border of Orange and Riverside counties southeast of Los Angeles. The trail ranges in elevation from about 2,000 feet to about 4,000 feet. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Kyndall Jack, an 18-year-old who had been missing in Orange County's Trabuco Canyon since Easter Sunday, was rescued after a hiker heard her screams and alerted rescue teams.

A refinery that burned coal was built nearby and over time the water nearby became very acidic. The coral and marine life died because of this but a few miles north on another beach named Greendale the same creatures are surviving just fine. Will building a refinery at Greendale cause the acidity of the water to increase or decrease? Hint: Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume. Answer:","completion":"Building a refinery at Greendale will likely cause the acidity of the water to increase due to the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to ocean acidification."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Summarize: Normal concealers do not hide facial redness well, but a corrective concealer relies on the principle of complementary colors to balance out discolored skin. For facial redness, apply a green-tinted concealer. Apply small dots of concealer over the red areas of your face. Blend it in gently using your fingertips or a makeup sponge. If the redness persists over time or is too strong to be covered up by concealer, you may have a condition called rosacea. Contact your dermatologist if you think you may have it. Avoid applying a heavy layer. The concealer may or may not cover up all of the redness on your face. Even if a standard, moderate amount does not hide every ounce of unwanted red, you should avoid using a thick coating of it. The green tint might start showing through if there is too much concealer to blend into your skin. If you're trying to cover widespread redness from a sunburn, a green-tinted primer might be better than concealer. Your skin redness may be due to sun exposure. Apply sunscreen before leaving the house, even when it seems cloudy. Facial and sensitive-skin sunscreens exist at your local drugstore. Sunscreen must be at least SPF 30 to be effective. “Non comedogenic” sunscreen avoids clogging up your pores. You can also buy face makeup or moisturizer that has sunscreen in it. In drier, colder weather, your face can get wind burnt and the particles in the air can strip away healthy layers of skin and damage the surface of your skin. If you protect them, your cheeks and nose will be less rosy once you step back inside a room. When your face is exposed to the cold, the blood vessels constrict, causing your skin to turn white. Once you step into a warmer area, however, all the blood rushes back to your face at once, causing your skin to become bright red. Wear a scarf, hat, or ski-mask made of non-irritating fibers. There are some dietary changes you can make to help with the redness from the inside. Hydrating, cooling foods like carrots, sweet potatoes, apples, celery, coconuts, cucumbers, melons, peaches, papayas, spinach, and broccoli contain antioxidants capable of moisturizing your skin from the inside out. If your urine is a pale yellow that is almost clear, you are hydrated enough. If your urine is a concentrated yellow or orange-yellow, you should drink more water. By consuming more of these foods, you can protect your skin from drying out when exposed to cold winter air or other harsh, dry conditions. Avoid spicy foods, hot drinks, caffeine, and alcohol. These encourage skin redness and will only exacerbate your skin problem. Cucumbers have a high water content and many vitamins and minerals that can help hydrate your skin. Peel and slice a chilled cucumber. Lean your head back and place slices over any red areas of your face for 15 to 20 minutes. Within that amount of time, the vitamin C in the cucumber should have reduced any pesky redness. Avoid rubbing cucumber over your skin, however, since the friction can cause further irritation. Green tea has anti-inflammatory agents and helps constrict blood vessels in your skin, which will help reduce redness and inflammation. Put several tea bags or a few tablespoons of loose leaf tea in a pot of boiling water and remove from heat. Let the tea steep for 10 minutes. Once the tea steeps, pour it into a bowl and lay a washcloth in the green tea, soaking it up as the tea cools. When the tea is at room temperature, run the tea soaked cloth over your face. You can also use chamomile and peppermint tea. Avoid using peppermint tea if your skin is sensitive. Make sure you use a cloth you don't mind getting stained. The green tea will have a color and will likely stain whatever cloth you use. Do not rub the cloth over your face vigorously, since that will irritate your skin further. Be careful putting petroleum jelly on acne-prone skin: it can make acne worse. For an extra layer of protection on your skin, you can spread a thin coating of petroleum jelly over your face. The petroleum jelly will prevent your blood vessels from constricting and expanding too quickly, which can reduce or prevent most facial redness. If you are unsure, apply to a small area of your cheek where your redness is not the worst. If your skin is redder or more irritated in a few hours, do not apply jelly to the rest of your face. Cold temperatures can reduce redness by shrinking the blood vessels in your skin. This method is especially useful if the redness is accompanied by feelings of burning or swelling. For the cold compress, take a clean, soft washcloth and run it under cool water. Gently press it to the irritated area. You can also use an icepack wrapped heavily in towels, if you want to avoid a wet compress. You can also place a wet washcloth in the refrigerator for a few minutes to cool it before pressing it to your face. Do not use rough or cold washcloths.","completion":"Normal concealers may not effectively hide facial redness, but corrective concealers use complementary colors to balance out discolored skin.

Context: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human.

Question: Which change will occur in the wire of an electrical circuit that is working properly? Pick your answer from: [I] The wire will become warmer.; [II] The wire will lose some of its mass.; [III] The wire will form an electric field.; [IV] The wire will develop a new crystal structure.; Answer:","completion":"Answer: [I] The wire will become warmer. Explanation: When an electrical circuit is working properly, an electric current flows through the wire, which consists of moving charged particles such as electrons. As these electrons flow through the wire, they occasionally interact with the wire's atoms, which vibrate and create resistance. The resistance provided by the wire's atoms results in a transfer of energy from the electrons to the atoms, as the electrons lose some of their energy during the collisions. This energy transfer manifests itself as heat, which causes the wire's temperature to increase. Therefore, the wire will become warmer when an electrical circuit is functioning properly. This effect is most noticeable in cases where the resistance of the wire is relatively high, such as in incandescent light bulbs, where the wire becomes hot enough to produce light when an electric current passes through it. Regarding the other options: [II] The wire will lose some of its mass: It is highly unlikely that the wire will lose any significant portion of its mass while an electrical circuit is working properly. While some loss may occur due to electron collisions causing atoms to be displaced from the wire's surface, the amount of mass lost in this way would be negligible and not noticeable. [III] The wire will form an electric field: While a magnetic field is created around the wire when current flows through it, the electric field is a property of charged objects, not necessarily the wire itself. As an electrical circuit works properly, the electric field would not be a result of the wire itself but rather the voltage source and connected components that influence the distribution of charges. [IV] The wire will develop a new crystal structure: There is no substantial basis for the claim that a new crystal structure will form in the wire. Under normal operating conditions, the wire's lattice structure remains relatively unchanged. However, it should be noted that in cases where high amounts of heat are generated, like in the case of highly resistive wires used in heating elements, the structure may be subject to change over extended usage and time. These changes are usually due to mechanical stress or high-temperature effects, but they are not expected under typical conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It has been the capital since 1918, the thirteenth in the history of Armenia, and the seventh located in or around the Ararat plain. - Haghpat is a village in the Lori Province of Armenia, located near the city of Alaverdi and the state border with Georgia. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Spitak, is a town in the northern Lori Province of Armenia. It is north of the capital, Yerevan, and west of the provincial centre, Vanadzor. Spitak was entirely destroyed during the devastating 1988 earthquake, and it was subsequently rebuilt in a slightly different location. As of the 2011 census, the population of the town is 12,881. - The Dzoraget is a river in the Debeda hydrological region in the Lori region in Northern Armenia. It originates in the Bazum Mountains and flows west to east through spectacular gorges around Stepanavan. It finally feeds into the Debed river near Dzoragyugh, which ultimately drains to the Kura river. - Akhtala, is a town in the Lori Province of Armenia, located along the Shamlugh river, on the slopes of Lalvar mountain, at a distance of 186 km north of the capital Yerevan and 62 km north of provincial centre Vanadzor. Akhtala was a village until 1939 when it was granted the status of an urban community, with its 400 inhabitants. In 1995, the government of independent Armenia reaffirmed the status of Akhtala as a town. According to the 2009 official estimate, Akhtala has around 2,400 inhabitants. However, the town used to have around 4,500 inhabitants during the 1970s. - Sanahin is a village in the northern province of Lori in Armenia, now considered part of the city of Alaverdi (the cable car that connects it with the Alaverdi centre is supposed to have the steepest climb in the whole former USSR). The village is notable for its Sanahin Monastery complex, founded in the 10th century and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the monastery in nearby Haghpat. - Alaverdi, is a town in the Lori Province at the northeastern part of Armenia, near the border with Georgia. It is located at the only direct rail link between Armenia and Georgia. Situated at the bottom of the Debed river gorge, Alaverdi is an important commercial and industrial centre in northern Armenia. - The Armenian Highlands (also known as the Armenian Upland, Armenian plateau, Armenian tableland, or simply Armenia) is the central-most and highest of three land-locked plateaus. To its west is the Anatolian plateau which rises slowly from the lowland coast of the Aegean Sea and converges with the Armenian Highlands to the east of Cappadocia. To its southeast is the Iranian plateau, where the elevation drops rapidly by about to above sea level. The Caucasus extends to the northeast of the Armenian Highlands. To the southwest of the Armenian Highlands is Upper Mesopotamia. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.

Since we know that \\"clams live at the bottom of the ocean\\", the best option from the given choices would be \\"4. in sea depths\\". However, it is important to provide a more detailed and lengthy explanation for this choice, taking into account the different factors that play a role in clam collection and ocean depths. Firstly, it is essential to consider the various types of clams that are edible and ideal for supper. Some common varieties include hard-shell clams (also known as quahogs), soft-shell clams (or steamers), and razor clams. Each type of clam has its habitat and specific method of collection. They are generally found along the coastal areas, where ocean tides play a significant role in their life cycle. To collect clams, it is not necessary to dive into deep sea depths. Rather, one should find a suitable location along the coastline, ideally in areas with tidal flats, sandy or muddy bottoms, and shallow water, since these are the preferred habitats of clams. Before heading out to collect clams, it is crucial to know and follow local regulations, seasons, and limits. This can include the requirement of a permit, a specific legal clam size, and a daily bag limit. Responsible clam harvesting not only ensures sustainability but also helps maintain a healthy ecosystem. The collection of clams can be done during low tide when the water recedes, allowing easier access to the ocean floor where clams are buried. Some common clamming methods include digging in the soft sediment with a shovel or rake, using a clamming gun (a suction device specifically designed for clam collection), or simply using bare hands to feel for buried clams. While the actual method utilized may depend on the type of clam being collected and local customs, the common denominator is spending time along the shoreline where clams dwell. Therefore, the boy in question must spend time \\"in sea depths\\", but with a clearer understanding that he should be focused more on coastal areas with appropriate conditions for clam collection, rather than diving deep into the ocean. In conclusion, based on the initial information about clams, the boy would have the most success collecting clams for supper by spending time along the shoreline in appropriate areas, focusing on the sea depths, and particularly during low tide, to locate and harvest these delectable shellfish."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: A mother whose newborn son was mistakenly turned over by maternity ward staff to another mother and breast-fed has sued the Minneapolis hospital. Tammy Van Dyke, of Apple Valley, sued Allina Health System's Abbott Northwestern Hospital late last week. The suit said the Dec. 5, 2012, mix-up led to \\"unnecessary medical treatment, tests and expenses, and severe mental injury and emotional pain and suffering.\\" In response, Abbott acknowledged the mistake, saying it appears the staff failed to follow procedure of matching codes on the infants' and mothers' identification bands. Two months later, Abbott instituted a new procedure using higher-tech identification bands to avoid further mix-ups. \\"We began using electronic identification bands for the mother and infant that must be matched when returning the infant to the mother,\\" said Michelle Smith, who oversees Abbott's Mother Baby Center. \\"This helps us to assure that the identity of the infant and mother are matched each time.\\" The new system displays a green light to tell the nurse that the mother and baby match. Allina spokeswoman Gloria O'Connell said Tuesday she's unaware of any such mix-up occurring at Abbott since the electronic bands started being used. Van Dyke gave birth to son Cody Stepp on Dec. 3, 2012, and the boy was handed over to another mother in the center and breast-fed, the suit said. Cody was wearing three hospital ID bracelets with the proper identification on his ankle, according to his mother. A few days after the late-night mistake, Van Dyke said that Cody and the other woman, who had given birth to twins, were given blood tests to make sure they were not exposed to any infectious diseases, such as hepatitis or HIV, that can be transmitted through breast milk. All the tests were negative, she said — but Cody had retesting scheduled every three months for a year. The suit seeks more than 50,000 and whatever other compensation a court might find proper for Van Dyke. Her attorney, Wayne Jagow, declined to discuss specific facts of the case, but said they decided to sue after negotiations for a settlement failed. \\"My client had no desire to bring herself into the limelight again by starting a lawsuit, but really had no choice as our statute of limitations was up,\\" Jagow said in an e-mail. \\"We had attempted to get some sort of dialogue going with Abbott/Allina over the last year to handle this quietly and they simply refused.\\" Jagow also said Van Dyke was not told of any changes to procedures to prevent this from happening to other families. \\"This has always been her primary concern,\\" he said. ||||| A newborn baby will have to undergo a year of medical tests for HIV and hepatitis because he was accidentally put in the wrong bassinet by a Minneapolis hospital and then breastfed by the wrong mother. The mix-up happened Wednesday in Abbott Northwestern Hospital when Tammy Van Dyke's little boy Cody was accidentally switched to the wrong bassinet in the nursery. \\"You put your baby in the nursery, not even 48-hours old, and you think they're safe,\\" Van Dyke told ABC News today. \\"I'm holding it together. I'm just in disbelief, and it was like I was in a dream, a bad dream, and I couldn't get it to stop.\\" Van Dyke was told two hours after the switch happened, just hours before she was going to take Cody home. The infant had to undergo blood testing for HIV and hepatitis immediately following the switch. \\"It was horrible,\\" Van Dyke said. \\"Two nurses had to go in through veins in his tiny little arms.\\" Although the tests came back negative, Abbott Northwestern Hospital told Van Dyke her newborn son would have to undergo blood testing every three months for a year. Hospital spokeswoman Gloria O'Connell said the tests were \\"just a precaution,\\" but declined to elaborate because of patient confidentiality. Van Dyke was able to speak with the other mother, who had to wait 20 minutes before her baby, Liam, was located. \\"It gave me peace of mind to talk to her,\\" Van Dyke said. \\"She was just as distraught as me that this happened to her, and in the meantime, also didn't know where her baby was. She has twins.\\" Van Dyke, who also has a 2-year-old, said the homecoming shortly after wasn't what she thought it would be. \\"I imagined getting up and getting ready and having Cody in the car with his big brother and coming home as a happy family,\\" Van Dyke said. \\"We were going to videotape the homecoming, showing his room, and I couldn't stop crying. I couldn't put myself together, because it wasn't what I had imagined all this time.\\" In an apology letter given to her, the hospital states: \\"Please accept this letter with our sincerest apologies for what occurred today at the hospital, that in the nursery your newborn son was placed in the wrong bassinette and then was taken to the wrong mother and breastfed. The hospital agrees to pay for the additional testing that you had done today and will also pay for the tests recommended for your son related to this incident up to one year.\\" And in a press release from Abbott Northwestern, practicing obstetrician and Chief Clinical Officer of Allina Health, Dr. Penny Wheeler, said, \\"As an obstetrician, I have personally seen verification of the infant's identifying name band matched correctly with the mother's on hundreds of occasions. It is extremely unfortunate that was not the case this time. We sincerely apologize to the involved families and will make certain we understand why our procedures were not appropriately followed in this case.\\" \\"I will be thankful to God when this year's over and he's cleared all his health tests and we don't have to think about this again,\\" Van Dyke said. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In December 2012, a newborn baby named Cody was mistakenly given to the wrong mother and breastfed in a Minneapolis hospital.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last step of the process, after the energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions, is the creation of seismic waves that cause the ground to shake, leading to an earthquake. When the energy builds up in the Earth's crust and reaches a critical point at or near fault lines, the enormous stress causes the fault to slip or give way. This movement of the Earth's plates along the fault line releases the stored energy in the form of seismic waves. There are mainly two types of seismic waves: Body waves and Surface waves. Body waves consist of Primary waves (P-waves) and Secondary waves (S-waves). Primary waves are the fastest-moving seismic waves and cause the ground to move back and forth, while Secondary waves move slower and cause the ground to move up and down as well as side to side. Surface waves, on the other hand, travel along the Earth's surface and cause the most damage due to their larger amplitudes and slower velocities. These seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and along its surface, causing the ground to shake as they pass through. This ground shaking is what we typically experience as an earthquake. The intensity of the shaking can vary greatly depending on the magnitude of the earthquake, the distance from the epicenter, the depth of the earthquake's focus, and the type of geological materials and structures in the affected area. As the seismic waves propagate away from the epicenter, they lose energy and become weaker, resulting in diminishing shaking intensity. However, in some situations, the seismic waves can get trapped in sedimentary basins and amplify, leading to stronger shaking and more significant damage. In the aftermath of an earthquake, several secondary processes might occur. These include aftershocks – smaller earthquakes that follow the main shock and can cause further ground shaking and damage, potential landslides and rockfalls triggered by the initial shaking, and, in coastal areas, the possibility of tsunamis generated by underwater faults or landslides. In summary, the final step of the process after energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions is the generation of seismic waves that propagate through the Earth, causing ground shaking and resulting in an earthquake. This event can lead to varying levels of damage, depending on the specific conditions of each earthquake."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: When we got married we thought it was going to be all bliss and happiness for life. By about week two we both had an awakening. Something about being exact opposites and together 24/7. We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other. Well actually, there have been probably a couple of those days for my wife. She’s just too nice to say it. A great marriage isn’t built because it’s perfect.

Please answer the following question: ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered.

How do you say this sentence in English?","completion":"The sentence \\"¿Para qué sirve el CO2?\\" in English translates to \\"What is the purpose of CO2?\\" or \\"What is CO2 used for?\\" Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a chemical compound consisting of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, and it serves several essential functions in our environment and various industries. 1. Photosynthesis: CO2 plays a vital role in the process of photosynthesis carried out by plants, algae, and some microorganisms. These organisms use sunlight, water, and CO2 to produce glucose, a type of sugar that provides energy for growth, and release oxygen as a byproduct. Photosynthesis maintains a balance of oxygen and CO2 in the atmosphere and is the primary source of oxygen required for life on Earth. 2. The Carbon Cycle: CO2 is a crucial component of the Earth's natural carbon cycle, where carbon is exchanged among the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial ecosystems. It is released into the atmosphere through respiration, decomposition of organic matter, and combustion of fossil fuels. CO2 in the atmosphere can be absorbed by plants for photosynthesis or dissolved in the ocean, where it participates in the marine ecosystem and can eventually form carbonate rocks. This continuous cycle helps regulate Earth's climate and atmospheric composition. 3. Greenhouse Effect: CO2 is a greenhouse gas that absorbs and emits infrared radiation. The greenhouse effect refers to the process by which certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat, warming the Earth's surface and stabilizing its climate. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have led to an increase in CO2 concentrations, causing a significant impact on global climate change. 4. Industrial and Commercial Uses: CO2 has various applications in different industries and commercial processes. It is used in food and beverage industries as a refrigerant, to carbonate drinks, and to preserve freshness. In the medical field, CO2 is utilized for its constriction and dilation properties in certain medical procedures. Additionally, CO2 is employed in fire extinguishers, the production of chemicals, and enhanced oil recovery techniques. In conclusion, carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of life on Earth and has a range of applications across various industries. However, it is essential to manage CO2 emissions responsibly to prevent adverse effects on the environment and global climate."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"what is the first area mentioned?\\" Context: \\"Ptolemy's Geography divided Asia on a similar basis.

What did the English dancer Margaret Kelly found in 1932????","completion":"In 1932, the accomplished English dancer and actress Margaret Kelly founded one of the most iconic and glamorous dance troupes in history, known as the Bluebell Girls. The dance troupe originated in Paris, France, and quickly gained widespread acclaim for their high-kicking and spectacular choreographed routines, forever changing the face of French cabaret entertainment. Margaret Kelly was born on June 24, 1910, in Liverpool, England. She began dancing at a young age and pursued a career as a professional dancer. After moving to Paris, she was given the nickname \\"Miss Bluebell\\" due to her beautiful blue eyes. This, in turn, inspired the name of her famed dance troupe. The Bluebell Girls were initially formed as a chorus line of classically trained dancers with precise choreography, adept at performing high leg-kicks and elaborate dance routines. The group's home base was the legendary Lido de Paris, a luxurious cabaret and burlesque show venue located on the world-famous Champs-Élysées. They quickly became the star attraction at the Lido and across numerous other premier Parisian entertainment venues such as the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Bergère. The key to the Bluebell Girls' immense success was largely due to Margaret Kelly's high standards and commitment to discipline and quality. She carefully chose talented dancers from around the world, ensuring they were well-trained and exhibited grace, poise, elegance, and uniformity. The girls stood out due to their height, which was a crucial factor in their selection. Margaret Kelly insisted that her dancers should be tall, with a minimum height requirement of 5'8\\" for American dancers and 5'10\\" for dancers of other nationalities. Throughout their illustrious career, the Bluebell Girls performed for millions of people, including Hollywood stars, politicians, and European royalty. They participated in renowned events such as the prestigious Royal Variety Performance in England, and their shows were elaborate productions complete with ornate costumes, grand sets, and spectacular special effects. Margaret Kelly's Bluebell Girls served as a stepping stone for many dancers who would eventually develop successful solo careers in the entertainment industry. Kelly eventually retired from active involvement in the dance troupe in 1986, though she remained the honorary president until her death in 2004. Today, the legacy of the Bluebell Girls and their contribution to the world of cabaret and dance endures, as they continue to uphold the high standards set by their founder. In summary, Margaret Kelly founded the iconic Bluebell Girls dance troupe in 1932 in Paris, France. Trained in classical dance, the group revolutionized French cabaret entertainment with their high-kicking routines and unique blend of elegance, precision, and glamour. The legacy of the Bluebell Girls lives on as they continue to captivate audiences across the world as a symbol of timeless showmanship and the creative vision of their pioneering founder."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Who is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries? Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to begin exercising regularly. Michael took this advice to heart, and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Robert, on the other hand, only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks. Hint: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.","completion":"Based on the information provided, Robert is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries. This is because he only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks, whereas Michael took the advice to heart and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Regular aerobic exercise is known to lower LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) and increase HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol), which helps to prevent the build-up of LDL cholesterol in the arteries. Since Robert exercises less frequently than Michael, he has a higher risk of LDL cholesterol build-up."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Unique Diet of Two-Million-Year-Old South African Pre-Humans Introduction Recent analysis of a two-million-year-old \\"missing link\\" fossil discovered in South Africa has provided fascinating insights into the diet of these pre-humans. While the diet of other early hominids has been relatively well-documented, little was known about the unique South African species, until now. Researchers have found that unlike other pre-human species, this short and gangly creature consumed a diet rich in leaves and fruit – a striking resemblance to the diet of modern-day chimpanzees. Unearthing the Missing Link The fossil in question, referred to as the \\"missing link,\\" is believed to bridge the evolutionary gap between modern humans and their distant ancestors. Uncovered in South Africa, this rare find has the potential to shed light on the little-known history of our own lineage. By studying the diet of these early hominids, scientists hope to better understand the evolutionary changes that led to the development of Homo sapiens as the sole surviving member of the hominid taxonomic family. A Diet Rich in Leaves and Fruit Researchers have meticulously analyzed the fossil's preserved dental remains, offering a glimpse of a species that once thrived in the abundant landscapes of South Africa. Intriguingly, the findings revealed that this particular hominid had a diet predominantly composed of leaves and fruit. Such a diet starkly contrasts with that of other pre-humans, making this South African species truly unique. The research team's findings showed strong evidence of the short and gangly creature relying heavily on soft, easy-to-consume vegetation like leaves, while also incorporating larger quantities of fruit into its dietary intake. These food choices significantly differ from other pre-human diets that were primarily based on nuts, seeds, and root vegetables – a reflection of a distinct lifestyle and habitat. A Connection to Modern Chimpanzees Interestingly, the diet of the South African pre-human species draws an intriguing parallel with that of present-day chimpanzees. Chimps are known to primarily consume fruit and leaves, with a diet comprising of approximately 58% fruit, 27% leaves, and the remaining percentage consisting of seeds, flowers, and other plant materials, as well as insects. This striking similarity in dietary habits between the two-million-year-old South African pre-human and modern chimpanzees provides intriguing insights into their potential relationship and shared ancestry. Conclusion The analysis of this rare \\"missing link\\" fossil has undeniably expanded our understanding of early human evolution, particularly concerning the unique dietary habits of the South African pre-human species. By comparing this pre-human's diet to that of modern chimpanzees, scientists can uncover new information about the evolution of our own species and the environment in which it thrived. The findings prompt further exploration into the diets and lifestyles of pre-human species found in other regions, creating a more comprehensive view of the diverse history of humankind. As the field of paleoanthropology continues to evolve and unearth new discoveries, we come one step closer to unraveling the fascinating mysteries that lie at the core of our own lineage and history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyzing the given text, we can infer the following truths about the narrator's life: 1. They paid their bills: The narrator explicitly mentions, \\"I have bills.\\" While they do not specifically say that they paid their bills, it can be implied that as the sole breadwinner for the family, they would be responsible for ensuring that the bills are paid. This statement showcases the financial obligations they have to fulfill. 2. They have extra responsibility: The statement, \\"I was the only one working in my family,\\" clearly establishes that the narrator bears the burden of not just their own needs but also those of their family members. This additional weight makes their life more challenging and demanding as compared to someone without such an obligation. 3. They had good alternatives: This statement, in fact, is not true. The narrator explicitly mentions that \\"there were no good alternatives available.\\" This lack of appealing options has not only limited their choices but also forced them to make difficult decisions on the spot. 4. They paid their mortgage: Similar to the first statement, while the narrator mentions, \\"I have a mortgage to pay,\\" they do not explicitly state that they paid their mortgage.

Tara Maclay is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003). She was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed by Amber Benson. Tara is a shy young woman with magical talents who falls in love with Willow Rosenberg, one of the core characters. Together, they help Buffy Summers, who has been given superhuman powers to defeat evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Tara becomes more outspoken during the sixth season about the ethics of Willow's use of magic, cautioning Willow that she depends too much on it. The dynamics of their relationship suddenly turn during \\"Once More, with Feeling\\". Willow had cast a spell on Tara to alter her memory in the preceding episode and Tara finds out about it during \\"Once More, with Feeling\\", the musical episode of the series. Tara was given a prominent role in the musical due to the skill of Benson's voice: she sings a love ballad to Willow, a duet with Giles, and backup in two other songs. The musical nature of the episode compelled the characters to express what they had been feeling secretly, or had refused to admit to themselves. Tara's song is a fervent and explicit expression of love for Willow which she had not made clear to the audience until this point. Tara later sings with Giles that she will leave Willow if she does not change. Self-conscious about her singing abilities, Hannigan requested not to be given a song and sings only a few lines in the episode. Critics saw this as Tara's personality becoming more forceful as Willow begins to show signs of weakness as she is overtaken by her addiction. Tara challenges Willow to go for a week without using any magic. Willow almost immediately breaks her promise, however, and Tara leaves her at the end of \\"Tabula Rasa\\". Tara remains a part of the group, spending time with Dawn, and non-judgmentally acting as Buffy's confessor when Buffy divulges she has a painful and compulsive sexual relationship with Spike, a vampire whom she loathes. Despite their separation, Tara remains devoted to Willow's recovery and supports her in her decision to abstain from using magic. She is, according to author Lorna Jowett, one of the few characters who is never seduced by evil. Shuttleworth notes that most Buffy characters go through a rite of transformation except for Tara. Among female characters she is the most virtuous. Like the other Buffy characters in the series whose names have symbolic interpretations, Tara's name resembles the Latin terra, meaning \\"earth.\\" She is solidly grounded, with Willow attached to her, and Benson's body more naturally representative of women. Tara is wholly feminine both in dress and demeanor, as opposed to Buffy and (less) Willow mostly dressed with trousers and jackets, but never seeks male approval. She is clad in earthy, natural colors, long flowing skirts and clinging blouses, with an intent to comfort instead of arouse as other women on the show are dressed. Her admonishments to other characters are always made with love, with their best interests at heart. Even Tara's last words, commenting that Willow's shirt is stained (with Tara's own blood), indicate her preoccupation with the welfare of others. Tara has also appeared in The Long Way Home, Always Darkest, Retreat, and the one-off Willow.","completion":"This text is about Tara Maclay, a fictional character from the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Solve this math problem Solve 4807 - 5192 = 35*d for d.","completion":"First, let's look at the problem in a clearer way, focusing on solving for the variable d: 4807 - 5192 = 35 * d This is a simple linear algebra equation wherein we need to find the value of variable 'd'. The first step to solving for 'd' is to simplify the left side. To do so, we will perform the subtraction operation between 4807 and 5192. So we get: -385 = 35*d This simplifies the equation, as it now only has one operation left, which is the division to find the value of 'd'. To isolate the variable on one side and ensure 'd = something', you divide both sides of the equation by 35. Considering that every operation performed on one side of the equation must be performed on the other side as well to maintain the equality, we get: d = -385 / 35 Now, we just need to perform the simple division operation to find the value of 'd'. So, we have: d = -11 So, to summarize: You start with 4807 - 5192 = 35*d. Subtracting the two values on the left gives us -385 = 35*d. Then you isolate 'd' by dividing both sides of the equation by 35, giving you d = -11. Therefore, the solution to the problem 4807 - 5192 = 35*d is d = -11."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Don't give up: there may be a place for you in the world of voice-acting. _ . In addition to many appearances on television and in movies, Rickey is a voice-over actor, someone we hear but don't see. Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother-- a manager and acting coach--helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud. Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for communicating toys. In films, they replace the foreign language conversation with English version. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They read books on tape and even record museum tours. Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing, volume, and range. Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises. Rickey receives his Danny Phantom scripts only a few days before he tapes each episode . He writes helpful notes on the script to guide himself on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones. \\"The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,\\" says Rickey.

Mix one part vinegar with one part water in a bowl. Then, submerge the water bottle in the solution, making sure the solution gets inside the water bottle. Let the bottle soak for one to two minutes. Another option is to fill the bottle with the vinegar and water solution. Then, let the solution sit in the bottle for one to two minutes. Once you have soaked the bottle, rinse out the solution. Then, use a damp brush or a sponge to scrub the bottle. Make sure you scrub the mouth and lid of the bottle well, as this is usually where germs live. Scrubbing the bottle will also help to remove any remaining vinegar in the bottle. Let the water bottle air dry on a drying rack or a clean towel overnight. If you are in a rush, you can use a clean cloth to dry the bottle. Make sure you dry the mouth and lid of the bottle well.","completion":"The article provides a detailed guide on how to clean and disinfect a water bottle using a simple solution of white vinegar and water. This method is efficient and effective in removing germs and bacteria, ensuring a safe and clean bottle for use. Firstly, prepare the cleaning solution by mixing equal parts of white vinegar and water in a bowl. There are two ways to use this solution for cleaning the water bottle. The first method is to submerge the bottle entirely in the solution, ensuring that it fills the inside as well. The second method is to pour the solution directly into the bottle. In either case, let the bottle soak in the solution for about one to two minutes for the cleaning process to take effect. After soaking the bottle, thoroughly rinse out the solution using water. Proceed to scrub the entire bottle, paying extra attention to the mouth and lid areas, using a damp brush or sponge. These parts require special care as they are typically the most prone to germ accumulation. Scrubbing also helps eliminate any remaining vinegar residue inside the bottle. Once the scrubbing process is complete, allow the water bottle to air dry by placing it on a drying rack or a clean towel overnight. Air drying is more effective in removing any lingering moisture or smells. However, if you need your water bottle to dry quickly, you can use a clean cloth to pat it dry, ensuring that the mouth and lid areas are thoroughly dried as well. In summary, the article emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clean and germ-free water bottle for health reasons. By using a simple white vinegar and water solution, one can effectively disinfect and clean the bottle, paying particular attention to the mouth and lid areas. After scrubbing, it is crucial to let the bottle air dry or pat dry with a clean cloth to ensure a completely fresh and bacteria-free drinkware."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. According to the country's Minister of Health, the goal is that more than 90% of Ugandans will know their HIV status. The Minister, Dr Elioda Tumwesigye, spoke of the plan on 'The Truth About AIDS' on the BBC World Service. \\"We want to give an opportunity to every Ugandan at least one round to say yes or no to an HIV test,\\" he said. \\"We will go to every home, every village, and test.\\" Dr Tumwesigye claimed this door-to-door approach to testing counselling had worked well in the Western Ugandan district he represents as a member of parliament. If the East African country can establish the HIV status of nine out of every ten people, it will have achieved the first of three targets of a new grand initiative led by UNAids (the Joint United Nations programme on HIV/Aids). The 90-90-90 strategy is aimed at effectively ending the pandemic by the year 2030, by exploiting the preventative potential of well managed HIV/Aids treatment. If a patient takes their antiretroviral drugs properly, the amount of virus in the blood and other body fluids is lowered to a level where it is essentially undetectable. At these levels, the risk of transmitting the virus to other people is much reduced. The second 90 of the UNAids formula requires that 90% of those identified as HIV positive should be on antiretroviral therapy. The final criterion is that 90% of the patients on treatment must maintain complete virological suppression. In other words, therapy must be well enough administered and managed that the virus is unable to replicate in the body. UNAids has set a goal for countries to implement this regime by 2020. If nations can achieve this, computer modelling shows that the rate of new infections would be curbed drastically by the year 2030. The expense of ramping up services might be high in the short-term, but economic benefits are reaped later on as the cost of treating far fewer new patients plummets. Joshua Musinguzi, head of Uganda's Aids control programme said that his country has some way to go to reach the targets, but that they are achievable. \\"I like them because they are setting a stage for the country to move towards epidemic control. \\"The idea now is to move towards an Aids-free generation for Uganda. \\"In the last three consecutive years, we have actually enrolled more people on treatment each year than the number of new infections in those years. \\"This is a tipping point in the epidemic.\\" That is a significant milestone. However, Professor Vinand Nantulya, head of the Uganda Aids Commission, points out that currently the number of infected people on treatment is outnumbered by those who are not. \\"In Uganda, it's about 1.7 million people who should be on treatment and so far we are reaching about 800,000\\", said Prof Nantulya. \\"So we will need [more] money and [more] staff in the hospitals and clinics to put people on treatment, and then we need to follow up those on treatment to be sure that the treatment is having impact on the viral load in the blood.\\" Monitoring viral load requires expensive lab equipment that is not available in most Ugandan hospitals and clinics. More than doubling the number of people on medication will more than double the antiretroviral drugs bill. Currently about 80% of Uganda's HIV medication is paid for by international donors while the rest comes from the country's own coffers. Both overseas funders and the Ugandan government will need to dig much deeper to meet UNAids' 90-90-90 targets. According to Dr Medard Bitekyerezo, deputy chairperson of the Parliamentary Aids committee: \\"We are looking at levies on bank transactions and interest. \\"We are looking at air tickets, beer, soft drinks and even cigarettes,\\" as examples of goods and services which could be taxed to feed the AIDS fund. Dr Bitekyerezo stressed: \\"This money is going to be specifically targeted for HIV-related issues\\". Zimbabwe and Ghana are the only other African countries with similar HIV-dedicated funding mechanisms. Listen to The Truth About Aids on the BBC World Service What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The Minister of Health in Uganda wants more than 90% of people in the country to know if they have HIV or not.

The goal is to help end the spread of HIV by 2030. If people with HIV take their medicine correctly, they have a much lower chance of giving the virus to others. Uganda still has some work to do to reach the 90-90-90 targets, but they believe it is possible.

Q: which british prime minister declared war on germany? A:","completion":"A: Neville Chamberlain, who served as the British Prime Minister from 1937 to 1940, officially declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939. Neville Chamberlain, a member of the Conservative Party, was in office during the critical period of the late 1930s when tensions in Europe were escalating dangerously. Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime had aggressively expanded its grasp on European territory through annexations and military invasions, beginning with the remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936, followed by the annexation of Austria in 1938, and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939. Throughout these increasingly threatening geopolitical developments, Chamberlain pursued a policy of appeasement, which aimed to prevent the outbreak of a potentially catastrophic war by making diplomatic concessions to the expansionist demands of Nazi Germany. Chamberlain was hopeful that by addressing some of Germany's grievances from the Treaty of Versailles (the 1919 peace treaty that imposed harsh conditions upon Germany following World War I), Britain could satisfy Hitler and prevent further conflict. However, his policy of appeasement is now widely considered to have been misguided and ineffective. Hitler's appetite for conquest only grew, and Chamberlain's efforts to maintain peace did little to halt the Nazi regime's aggressive expansion. The tipping point came in September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. This was a direct violation of the Munich Agreement, which Chamberlain had helped to broker in 1938. The Munich Agreement, hailed by Chamberlain as an assurance of \\"peace for our time,\\" had granted Germany the Sudetenland—a predominantly German-speaking region of Czechoslovakia—on the condition that Hitler would make no further territorial claims in Europe. Hitler's invasion of Poland shattered any remaining optimism surrounding the policy of appeasement. In response, both Britain and France, which had treaty obligations to defend Poland, issued ultimatums to Germany demanding the withdrawal of their forces. When Germany failed to comply, both countries declared war on September 3, 1939. With that, Neville Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister, reluctantly proclaimed Britain's entry into World War II. In May 1940, following mounting criticism over his leadership during the war, Chamberlain resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Winston Churchill, who led Britain through its darkest hour and saw the Allied powers ultimately secure victory in 1945."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Men with beer belly forecast to die 17 years before those with thin stomach. Analysis carried out by former government advisor Margaret Ashwell. Fat around the middle wraps around organs and increases blood pressure. Raises the risk of health problems including heart disease and diabetes. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The Silent Killer: How Belly Fat Reduces Life Expectancy Introduction: The term \\"beer belly\\" is often used in a light-hearted manner to describe the appearance of a protruding stomach, typically in men, resulting from fat accumulation around the abdominal area. While it may be seen as a harmless joke, recent research and analysis conducted by former government advisor Margaret Ashwell revealed that individuals with excess abdominal fat have an alarmingly reduced life expectancy. Men with a beer belly could be at risk of dying up to 17 years earlier than their leaner counterparts. The Dangers of Abdominal Fat: In contrast with subcutaneous fat, which is stored just beneath the skin, the fat that accumulates around the midsection wraps itself around vital organs such as the stomach, liver, intestines, and pancreas. This visceral fat not only increases blood pressure but also releases harmful inflammatory chemicals and hormones, which can ultimately lead to a myriad of health issues. Excess abdominal fat has been directly linked to a higher risk of developing chronic conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and respiratory illnesses. Life Expectancy Impact: Margaret Ashwell's analysis unearthed alarming findings about the link between abdominal fat and life expectancy. Men with a beer belly are now forecasted to die up to 17 years earlier than those sporting a flat stomach. This staggering statistic highlights the urgent need for individuals with excess abdominal fat to take action in order to improve their overall health and extend their life expectancy. Why Belly Fat is More Dangerous: The reason behind abdominal fat being more dangerous than fat stored in other areas of the body lies in its proximity to essential organs. Fat pressing against these vital organs can impair their functioning, leading to inflammation and the production of harmful chemicals. Specifically, visceral fat generates a hormone called angiotensinogen, which accelerates blood pressure, increasing the risk of heart disease. Additionally, the fat cells around the waist secrete even more inflammatory cytokines-chemical messengers that further exacerbate health problems. Preventative Measures to Reduce Abdominal Fat: Tackling the issue of abdominal fat is not only critical for one's overall health but also for extending one's life expectancy. Implementing healthy lifestyle changes can significantly reduce excess belly fat and lower the risk of developing serious health conditions. The following are a few suggested preventative measures: 1. Balanced diet: Incorporate fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains into your daily meals. Limit the consumption of sugary and processed foods that contribute to weight gain and the formation of harmful visceral fat. 2. Regular exercise: Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with strength training exercises for all major muscle groups. 3. Stress management: High levels of stress can lead to hormone imbalances that encourage fat accumulation around the midsection. Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, can help in managing stress levels more effectively. 4. Adequate sleep: Aim for six to eight hours of sleep per night to maintain hormonal balance and support overall health. 5. Alcohol moderation: Limit alcohol intake as excessive consumption can contribute to weight gain, specifically around the abdominal area. Conclusion: While \\"beer belly\\" may seem like a benign term, its implications are far more serious than just an aesthetic concern. Excess abdominal fat is a significant risk factor for numerous health problems, ultimately leading to a shortened life expectancy. By embracing a healthier lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management, and alcohol moderation, individuals can effectively combat this silent killer and lead a happier, healthier, and longer life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who moved to London on completing his seven-year indenture? from the following article ? William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

Please briefly summarize this news article: Flooding and Rain Hits East Coast (CHARLESTON, S.C.) — Flooding from days of record-setting rain along the heavily populated East Coast washed out bridges and homes, and forecasters warned wind gusts topping 35 mph could down trees and power lines across the Carolinas and Virginia in the coming hours. At least five weather-related deaths have been reported since rains began spreading over the Eastern Seaboard, which has appeared to dodge the full fury of Hurricane Joaquin churning hundreds of miles out in the Atlantic. President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency in South Carolina and ordered federal aid to bolster state and local efforts as flood warnings remained in effect for many parts of the East Coast through Sunday. The steady downpour drew its moisture from a slow-moving low-pressure system over the Southeast that has linked up to a finger of tropical moisture from Hurricane Joaquin. Heavy rain was expected to continue overnight in the Carolinas and parts of northern Georgia and could cause some significant river and stream flooding, the National Weather Service said. The low-pressure system also was expected to whip up stiff northeasterly winds in the Blue Ridge mountains of the Carolinas and western Virginia with gusts up to 35 mph through Sunday, the weather service said. With tree roots already loosened in waterlogged soil, increased winds held the prospect of toppling trees onto power lines or property. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” North Carolina emergency management director Mike Sprayberry said late Saturday. High winds toppled a tree that hit a vehicle and killed a passenger Thursday near Fayetteville, North Carolina. Three people died in separate weather-related traffic incidents in South Carolina on Friday and Saturday, the Highway Patrol said. A drowning in Spartanburg, South Carolina, also was linked to the storm. The Greenville-Spartanburg Airport in South Carolina recorded 2.3 inches of rain Saturday, smashing the previous record of 0.77 inches set in 1961, according to John Tomko, National Weather Service meteorologist at Greenville-Spartanburg. “This one is extraordinary in that it’s such a prolonged event,” he said. Downtown Charleston was closed off to incoming traffic Saturday as rain flooded roads and left some motorists stranded as flood waters engulfed their cars, including a white BMW with water to the engine. At least two bridges were washed out in other parts of the state “Where we normally are dealing with flooding for a few hours, we’re dealing with it in days here,” Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen told The Associated Press. “We’re seeing areas flood today that did not traditionally flood.” Flooded roads were closed throughout the mid-Atlantic region and power companies reported scattered outages in several states. In New Jersey, storms dislodged an entire house from its pilings in a low-lying area of Middle Township in southern Jersey. No one was in the residence. Flood watches and warnings also are in effect in Delaware and parts of New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia. The weather service issued a warning for residents living along the coast to be alert for rising water. A combination of high water and high waves could cause beach erosion and damage docks and piers. In Ocean City, Maryland, spokeswoman Jessica Waters said moderate high tide flooding Saturday forced street closures in low-lying areas but caused no major damages or injuries. Meanwhile, the Atlantic Seaboard was spared what could have been much worse damage had Joaquin not continued on a path well off the U.S. coast. And some people found ways to enjoy the wet weather, cavorting in kayaks and canoes in some flooded areas. Steven Capito spent the day surfing by the Ocean View Fishing Pier in Norfolk, Virginia, where two- to three-foot waves crashed ashore. Ordinarily, he said waves from the Chesapeake Bay would barely lap his ankles. “It’s kind of a fun novelty to be out here in the bay,” said Capito, who lives in Virginia Beach. “You only get to do it a couple of times a year and it’s nice and warm.” Smith reported from Charleston and Foreman from Charlotte, North Carolina. Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Brock Vergakis in Norfolk, Virginia; David Dishneau in Ocean City, Maryland; Bruce Shipkowski in Trenton, New Jersey, and Julie Walker in New York.","completion":"Record-setting rain and flooding have hit the heavily populated East Coast of the United States, causing destruction of bridges and homes.

Movie title: The Hard Corps Movie plot: Phillip Sauvage (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is an American soldier suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder caused by his time in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sauvage snaps out of his stupor just long enough to join Clarence Bowden (Julian D. Christopher), his former commanding officer, to work as a bodyguard for former World Heavyweight boxing champion and now successful businessman Wayne Barclay (Raz Adoti). It appears that the release of notorious rap mogul Terrell Singletery (Viv Leacock) from prison has caused Barclay's worried sister Tamara (Vivica A. Fox) to take pro-active action by hiring Bowden and Sauvage, as Singletery has made threats in the past about doing away with the one man responsible for his incarceration Barclay himself. The first night of bodyguard work does not go well for Sauvage and Bowden, as Bowden gets killed during an assassination attempt on Barclay by a Hummer full of Uzi-carrying gangbangers sent by Singletery. It is up to Sauvage to continue the fight, which means bringing in a reinforcement in his friend Casey Bledsoe (Mark Griffin), and training some new recruits not of his choosing. Intending to give back to the streets that taught him toughness, Barclay insists that Sauvage compose his team of bodyguards by hiring people from Barclay's gym.

Lawrence ate more nuts than Adam did because Select from: + Lawrence liked to have salty snacks to eat. + Adam liked to have salty snacks to eat.","completion":"Lawrence ate more nuts than Adam did because Lawrence liked to have salty snacks to eat. As the evening progressed, Lawrence couldn't resist the bowl of mixed nuts on the table. The saltiness mixed with the varying textures of almonds, cashews, and pecans made it difficult for him to stop munching on them. Adam, on the other hand, preferred different types of snacks and was content with the occasional handful of nuts. While eating the salty nuts, Lawrence sipped a refreshing cold beverage, which only seemed to make the nuts more enticing. As they sat on the couch engaged in conversation, Lawrence continued to dip his hand into the bowl of nuts, enjoying the satisfying crunch that accompanied every bite. Since the nuts were positioned within Lawrence's reach, and he enjoyed them so much, his natural instinct was to continuously eat them. Adam, on the other hand, wasn't as much of a fan of salty snacks, preferring sweeter alternatives. He had a small plate of chocolate chip cookies nearby, which he nibbled on from time to time. He liked the sweet and comforting taste of the cookies and felt that there was no reason to force himself to eat more nuts than he wanted. Adam's fondness for his dessert allowed Lawrence to eat more nuts without feeling guilty about it. As the evening came to an end, the bowl of nuts was nearly empty. Lawrence, still enjoying the taste of the salty snack, felt no regret about indulging in his favorite type of treat. Adam, who barely consumed half the cookies, was satisfied with his self-restraint and was glad that both of them were able to have something they loved. In conclusion, it was Lawrence's preference for salty snacks that led him to eat more nuts than Adam did, while Adam's inclination towards sweet treats like cookies made him content with a smaller portion of nuts.

Tribunal says that until December, GCHQ was too secretive about how it shared data. This meant UK intelligence agency contravened European law on right to privacy. UK Home Office says government is committed to transparency and complies with law. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: GCHQ's Previous Data Sharing Policies Criticized for Infringement of Privacy Rights In a revealing ruling, a tribunal has found that, until December, the UK intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), had been showing excessive secrecy over its data-sharing methods. The tribunal's decision suggests that these practices contravened European law, particularly in regards to the right to privacy. I started the introduction with a summary of the main point, addressing the tribunal's ruling about GCHQ's excessive secrecy. It is important to provide this context to the reader in the beginning for them to properly understand the rest of the details. GCHQ, which plays a crucial role in national security and overseas intelligence, has been criticized for not being transparent enough about how it shares information. The tribunal noted that until December, GCHQ's practices had the potential to violate citizen's rights to privacy—an overarching principle protected under European law. In this second paragraph, I am unraveling more details about the GCHQ and what its function is. This is a good way of providing background information to the reader. I also briefly mention the potential implications of their non-transparent practices. Elaborating on the matter, the tribunal said the agency was not providing enough public information about the important safeguards that regulate how data is passed to foreign governments and UK law enforcement departments. The way GCHQ was handling and sharing information until recently contravened the privacy rights of individuals, established under the European Convention of Human Rights. With this paragraph, I’m providing a more detailed explanation of why the tribunal found the GCHQ's practices as contravening privacy rights. It is essential to lay out the specifics of the issue for the readers to fully comprehend the tribunal's concerns. While the tribunal's judgment is a significant setback, the UK Home Office reiterated the government's commitment to transparency. It stated that the government is fully resolved to comply with all legal frameworks, an explicit reference to the criticism levied at GCHQ. In this paragraph, I am incorporating the response from the UK Home Office to maintain a balanced view and offer readers insight into how the government is addressing the concerns raised by the tribunal. Reporting the government's standpoint is crucial to present the entire narrative. Given that the tribunal's criticism of GCHQ only relates to practices until December, it’s apparent that changes have been enacted to address these concerns. It remains to be seen how effective such changes have been and whether they will fulfill the government's commitment to transparency, whilst still ensuring national security. In the conclusion, I'm speculating about the possible effects of this judgment. Giving readers a sense of future developments effectively rounds out the article and paves the way for further reporting. To conclude, I'm re-emphasizing on the crux of the issue: a balance between privacy and national security. Throughout the article, I focused on presenting the facts clearly and objectively, which is the essence of good journalism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What are scalars and vectors? Why do vectors have components and scalars don't? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Scalars and vectors are two types of quantities used to describe different aspects of physical phenomena. Scalars are quantities that have only magnitude, and they do not have direction. Examples of scalar quantities include mass, energy, and temperature. Scalars can be described by a single numerical value. Vectors, on the other hand, are quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Examples of vector quantities include displacement, velocity, and force. Vectors are typically represented by an arrow that indicates the magnitude by its length and the direction by the arrowhead. Mathematically, vectors are typically described using components, which are the individual parts of the vector along each axis of the coordinate system. The reason why vectors have components and scalars don't is due to the directional aspect of vectors. Components are necessary to describe the direction of a vector in a coordinate system. A scalar, because it has no direction, does not require components to express its value. As for the last question, I assume you are asking if \\"Scalars vs. Vectors\\" and \\"Why do vectors have components and scalars don't?\\" have the same meaning. While both questions relate to the nature of scalars and vectors, they are not exactly the same. The first one asks for the definitions of scalars and vectors, while the second one asks specifically why vectors have components and scalars don't.

Possible A: roof, field, meadow, garden, garbage can Why is \\"roof\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Roof\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense as a location where you would be unlikely to find bugs because it is an environment not particularly conducive to supporting the needs of insects. Here are some detailed reasons: 1. Limited Food Sources: Bugs, like any other living organisms, require sustenance to survive. Roofs, being primarily constructed of materials like shingles, tiles, or metal, do not provide the organic matter that constitutes the primary food source for many insects. Furthermore, the elevated nature of roofs limits the likelihood of vegetation growth or the presence of other food sources, such as decomposing organic material or small organisms that insects may feed on. 2. Lack of Habitat: Roofs are generally designed to provide protection from the elements for buildings and structures. Consequently, they do not offer ideal habitats for insects, which typically seek out shelter and protection in locations with more vegetation, ground cover, or natural crevices. Roofs tend to be more open and exposed, making them an undesirable option for insect colonies or nesting grounds. 3. Exposure to Weather Conditions: Roofs bear the full brunt of the elements, including sunlight, wind, rain, and snow, which can all be harmful to insects. The constant exposure to these weather conditions can create inhospitable environments for insects that prefer more stable and temperate surroundings. Roofs generally lack the temperature-regulating insulation that soil, plant cover, or other natural elements provide for insects. 4. Limited Accessibility: Many insects crawl or fly close to the ground, making it difficult for them to access roofs of buildings. Their limited ability to reach elevated surfaces deters them from establishing themselves in such locations. Also, roofs that are well-maintained and free from overhanging branches or other points of access can become even more challenging for insects to reach. 5. Predators: Roofs can make some insects more vulnerable to their natural predators like birds or larger insects who can access the elevation of the roof. Insects tend to avoid locations where they are exposed and more likely to be targeted by predators. In contrast, the other possible answer options (field, meadow, garden, and garbage can) all have ample supplies of food, shelter, and moisture that can support the needs of various insect species. As a result, finding bugs in these more hospitable locations is significantly more likely."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Did you know that although peanuts look like nuts and taste like nuts, they aren't nuts at all? They belong to the pea family, so they are called peanuts. The peanut grows flowers above ground, but its \\"fruit\\" grows underground. It grows in more countries than most other \\"nuts\\". The peanut is a native South American plant. Scientists believe that it grew wild in Brazil long ago. They think that for several thousand years the early peoples of South America made it a part of their diet. These peoples were nomads who moved on when a natural food could no longer be found in one area. Along the way they probably let fall some peanuts, which got into the ground and grew. This is believed to be the way the plant reached the place where the Incas lived. The Incas, from about 1100 to 1532, thought highly of peanuts. The peanuts were eaten in several forms and used as sacrificial offerings to the Incan Sun God. Later in the 16thcentury, European soldiers had brought peanuts to other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Pacific Islands. Although peanuts were found native in South America, they are now grown in almost every country that has warm weather. India produces the most peanuts. China's production is next, followed by the United States. The peanut is special in more ways than one. It can be eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or fried. Hundreds of widely different products have been made from it. Carver, an American scientist, set himself the task of discovering new uses for eating and for many other products. Peanuts are very highly _ and are also high in protein . Americans use about seven-tenths of their protein in the form of meat. In India, where the poor can't pay for meat or milk, peanut meal and peanut milk have been produced. These have been a great help to the poor. New products are continually being made from peanuts, among them peanut cheese and a powder that becomes peanut butter when water is added. The fact is that peanuts are so healthy...

Background: James Buchanan Jr. was born in a log cabin in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania (now Buchanan's Birthplace State Park), in Franklin County, on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan, Sr. (1761-1821), a businessman, merchant, and farmer, and Elizabeth Speer, an educated woman (1767-1833). His parents were both of Ulster Scottish descent, the father having emigrated from Milford, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1783. One of eleven siblings, Buchanan was the oldest child in the family to survive infancy. Context: The Civil War erupted within two months of Buchanan's retirement. He supported the United States, writing to former colleagues that \\"the assault upon Sumter was the commencement of war by the Confederate states, and no alternative was left but to prosecute it with vigor on our part\\". He also wrote a letter to his fellow Pennsylvania Democrats, urging them to \\"join the many thousands of brave & patriotic volunteers who are already in the field\\". Buchanan spent most of his remaining years defending himself from public blame for the Civil War, which was even referred to by some as \\"Buchanan's War\\". He began receiving angry and threatening letters daily, and stores displayed Buchanan's likeness with the eyes inked red, a noose drawn around his neck and the word \\"TRAITOR\\" written across his forehead. The Senate proposed a resolution of condemnation which ultimately failed, and newspapers accused him of colluding with the Confederacy. His former cabinet members, five of whom had been given jobs in the Lincoln administration, refused to defend Buchanan publicly. Initially so disturbed by the attacks that he fell ill and depressed, Buchanan finally began defending himself in October 1862, in an exchange of letters between himself and Winfield Scott that was published in the National Intelligencer newspaper. He soon began writing his fullest public defense, in the form of his memoir Mr. Buchanan's Administration on the Eve of Rebellion, which was published in 1866. Buchanan caught a cold in May 1868, which quickly worsened due to his advanced age. He died on June 1, 1868, from respiratory failure at the age of 77 at his home at Wheatland and was interred in Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster. Question: What happened in his final years?.

Background: Meader was born in Waterville, Maine during one of the worst floods ever to hit New England: he often said he was born on \\"the night the West Bridge washed out\\". He was the only child of Charles Vaughn Meader, a millworker, and Mary Ellen Abbott. After his father broke his neck and drowned in a diving accident when Meader was only eighteen months old, his mother moved to Boston to work as a cocktail waitress, leaving Meader behind with relatives. A sometimes unruly and troubled child, Meader was sent to live with his mother in Boston at the age of five Context: On October 22, 1962, Meader joined writers Bob Booker and Earle Doud and a small cast of entertainers to record The First Family. The album poked fun at Kennedy's PT-109 history; the rocking chairs he used for his back pain; the Kennedy family's well-known athleticism, football games and family togetherness; children in the White House; and Jackie Kennedy's soft-spoken nature and her redecoration of the White House. The First Family became the fastest-selling record in the history of the United States. It sold 1.2 million copies during the first two weeks of its release, and ultimately sold 7.5 million copies. Kennedy himself was said to have given copies of the album as Christmas gifts, and once greeted a Democratic National Committee group by saying, \\"Vaughn Meader was busy tonight, so I came myself.\\" At one press conference, Kennedy was asked if the album had produced \\"annoyment [sic] or enjoyment.\\" He jokingly responded, \\"I listened to Mr. Meader's record and, frankly, I thought it sounded more like Teddy than it did me. So, now he's annoyed.\\" Kennedy told Benjamin Bradlee that \\"parts of it were amusing.\\" Other sources, such as Thomas C. Reeves' A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy, state that President Kennedy was upset with the parodies, and that First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was furious, even demanding that the President keep Meader off radio and television. Still in his 20s, Meader was suddenly famous, rich, and in constant demand. He was profiled in Time and Life magazines, appeared on network television variety shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show, The Jack Paar Program, The Andy Williams Show and Hootenanny. Though a series of tour dates in early 1963 were notably unsuccessful (Billboard reported that he \\"bombed\\" in Pittsburgh, and only 742 people showed up in Philadelphia), he still played to packed houses in Las Vegas. The First Family won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1963. That March, Meader recorded a follow-up album, The First Family Volume Two, a combination of spoken comedy and songs performed by actors and comedians portraying members of the President's family and White House staff. The sequel was released in the spring of 1963, and while not as successful as the first volume, still sold hundreds of thousands of copies. In July 1963, Meader left Cadence Records and Booker/Dowd to sign with MGM Records. Meader planned to record general satire and abandon his JFK impersonations. Question: How long did the show last?
