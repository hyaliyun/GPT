After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: \\"I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much.\\" He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Erard's on 1 March 1843.

Question: What does he persuade his viewers to shout out of their windows saying? Movie plot title: Network Movie plot: Howard Beale, the longtime anchor of the Union Broadcasting System's UBS Evening News, learns from his friend and the news division president, Max Schumacher, that he has just two more weeks on the air because of declining ratings. The two get drunk and lament the state of their industry. The following night, Beale announces on live television that he will commit suicide on next Tuesday's broadcast. UBS fires him after this incident, but Schumacher intervenes so that Beale can have a dignified farewell. Beale promises he will apologize for his outburst, but once on the air, he launches back into a rant claiming that life is \\"bullshit\\". Beale's outburst causes the newscast's ratings to spike, and much to Schumacher's dismay, the upper echelons of UBS decide to exploit Beale's antics rather than pull him off the air.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The original German sentence \\"Wie stabil sind die Gebiete, aus denen wir Energiequellen einführen können?\\" translates to \\"How stable are the regions from which we can import energy sources?\\" in English. Now, providing a detailed answer to the translated question: To determine the stability of the regions from which we can import various energy sources, we will analyze key energy resources: fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), nuclear power, and renewable resources (solar, wind, and hydroelectric power). 1. Fossil fuels: a) Oil: Major oil-exporting countries include Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States, Iraq, and Canada. Political situations in these countries and their regions are relatively stable, aside from volatility in the Middle East. The stability of oil prices can be a concern due to trade tensions, conflicts, and production changes. b) Natural Gas: The largest natural gas exporters are Russia, Qatar, the United States, and Australia. Regions such as Russia, the United States, and Australia provide relative geopolitical stability, while geopolitical tensions in the Persian Gulf could affect Qatar-based exports. c) Coal: Major exporters of coal are Australia, Indonesia, Russia, and the United States. These nations provide a relatively stable region for coal imports. 2. Nuclear power: Nuclear power is primarily imported in the form of fuel, Uranium. Key suppliers are Australia, Kazakhstan, and Canada. These countries provide a stable mining environment and a consistent supply of resources. 3. Renewable resources: a) Solar: Solar energy infrastructure is largely manufactured in China. With China's current economic and political climate, the solar manufacturing market remains relatively stable and secure. b) Wind: Wind energy is produced by turbines, with major manufacturing centers located in Denmark, Germany, China, and the United States. Policies supporting renewable energy and the stability of these countries assure a reliable import of wind power infrastructure. c) Hydroelectric power: Equipment for hydroelectric plants is manufactured in countries like China, the United States, and Canada. Although hydroelectric resources rely on rivers, which can cross international boundaries, most disputes surrounding hydroelectric power are resolved through peaceful negotiations, ensuring stable importation. In conclusion, the stability of regions from which we can import various energy sources is influenced by a mix of geopolitical factors, trade relations, national policies, and global market conditions. It's crucial to monitor these variables and diversify energy sources to mitigate potential disruptions and risks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This year, the Japanese conglomerate faces another scandal as reports emerge that at least two of its subsidiaries have also manipulated data. The parent company, Mitsubishi Materials, issued a statement admitting to the faked data from subsidiaries Mitsubishi Cable Industries and Mitsubishi Shindoh; Mitsubishi Aluminum Co. was also implicated by Reuters in the scandal. The troubled Japanese corporation is once again in the spotlight, raising questions about the ethics and management oversight not only of Mitsubishi but also of other major Japanese manufacturers who have been caught in similar controversies. Mitsubishi's fresh admission follows investigations into its subsidiaries and further adds to Japan's growing list of corporate controversies. CNNMoney reported that both Mitsubishi Cable Industries and Mitsubishi Shindoh had falsified data for car, aircraft, and industrial machinery parts in order to meet client specifications. Mitsubishi Cable had reportedly faked data for nearly 270 million rubber sealant units sold to over 220 clients. In addition, the firm had potentially continued to fabricate information after the initial discovery. The parent company, Mitsubishi Materials, stated it had not discovered any legal or safety issues related to the first two subsidiaries mentioned but did not clarify if the same applied to Mitsubishi Aluminum. The Japanese economy and trade minister was highly critical of the company, referring to the scandal as a \\"betrayal of trust in Japanese manufacturing.\\" The Wall Street Journal reported that Mitsubishi Cable had become aware in February that factory workers had manipulated the data; however, the company continued to ship products until the end of October while it conducted investigations.

Given the question: This article: Back in Paris with two years of his grant remaining, Bizet was temporarily secure financially and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city. The two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique, each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and frustrate new homegrown talent; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the Opéra. Although French composers were better represented at the Opéra-Comique, the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s. A number of smaller theatres catered for operetta, a field in which Offenbach was then paramount, while the Théâtre Italien specialised in second-rate Italian opera. The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the Théâtre Lyrique company which, despite repeated financial crises, operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager Léon Carvalho. This company had staged the first performances of Gounod's Faust and his Roméo et Juliette, and of a shortened version of Berlioz's Les Troyens.On 13 March 1861, Bizet attended the Paris premiere of Wagner's opera Tannhäuser, a performance greeted by audience riots that were stage-managed by the influential Jockey-Club de Paris. Despite this distraction, Bizet revised his opinions of Wagner's music, which he had previously dismissed as merely eccentric. He now declared Wagner \\"above and beyond all living composers\\". Thereafter, accusations of \\"Wagnerism\\" were often laid against Bizet, throughout his compositional career.As a pianist, Bizet had showed considerable skill from his earliest years.

Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which zoologist learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day? Hint: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. Answer:","completion":"The zoologist who learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day is Nate. This is because Nate studied diurnal animals, which are animals that are active during the day and sleep at night. On the other hand, Andy studied nocturnal animals, which are active during the night and sleep during the day. Nocturnal animals have developed various adaptations to help them avoid predation or enhance prey hunting, such as shifting their activity based on moonlight or optimizing the time of their emergence in the evening. Diurnal animals, like those studied by Nate, are typically more active during the day and less likely to be sleeping or hiding from predators during daytime hours. Thus, Nate would have had less exposure to the behaviors and adaptations of animals that sleep during the day compared to Andy, who specifically focused on nocturnal animals and their unique characteristics in relation to daytime inactivity and nighttime activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Summarize the following: On the morning of the day you want to roast the turkey or the night before, remove the brine from the refrigerator. Pour it into a 5 US gal (19 l) food-safe bucket or cooler. Mix in the ice water. Consider using a 5 US gal (19 l) drink cooler. These have good insulation and a drain spout for easy clean up. Take the turkey from the refrigerator and remove the innards. Discard the innards and the pop-up thermometer if your turkey has one. Put the turkey breast-side down in the brine-filled container. The turkey should be completely covered in brine. If it isn't, place a heavy plate or dish on the turkey to weigh it down. Cover the bucket and refrigerate the turkey while it brines. If you're using a cooler with a lid, screw the lid on and leave it in a cool place while the turkey brines. The cooler with the turkey and brine should keep the turkey at 38 °F (3 °C) or below. If you think the cooler isn't keeping the turkey cold enough, refrigerate it.","completion":"To prepare a turkey for roasting using the brining method, start by removing the brine from the refrigerator on the morning of the day you plan to roast the turkey or the night before. You'll need to pour the brine into a large, food-safe container with a capacity of at least 5 US gallons (19 liters), such as a bucket or cooler. A 5-gallon (19-liter) drink cooler is an ideal choice due to its insulation and built-in drain spout, which makes cleaning up easier. Next, add ice water to the container and mix it well with the brine. At this point, it's time to prepare the turkey. Remove it from the refrigerator, extract the innards, and dispose of them, alongside the pop-up thermometer, if your turkey is equipped with one. Now you're ready to place the turkey, breast-side down, into the container filled with brine, ensuring that it is fully submerged. If the turkey is not completely covered in brine, use a heavy plate or dish to weigh it down. Once the turkey is properly submerged, cover the container and place it in the refrigerator so that the turkey can brine. If you're using a cooler with a screw-on lid, simply secure the lid and store the cooler in a cool area, allowing the turkey to brine. The goal is to maintain the turkey's temperature at or below 38°F (3°C) throughout the brining process. If you're concerned that your cooler may not be providing adequate cold storage, opt to refrigerate the turkey to maintain the ideal temperature. By following the steps above, you'll ensure a well-brined turkey ready for roasting, leading to a tender, juicy, and flavorful final product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The choice of words and structure of the sentences may be different, but the overall message being conveyed is the same. In the first sentence, \\"His opinion contradicts one issued in 1992 by then-Attorney General Bob Stephan\\", the verb 'contradicts' emphasizes the difference or opposition between Kline's opinion and Stephan's 1992 opinion. The 'one issued in 1992' phrase is a clear reference to Stephan's opinion. In the second sentence, \\"Kline's legal opinion differs from the interpretation issued by former Attorney General Bob Stephan in 1992\\", the verb 'differs' serves the same purpose as 'contradicts' in the first sentence - to show the difference between the two opinions.

The lake is privately administered by the Spring Lake Association, which consists of the owners of cottages around the perimeter. There is no public access. The lake is located on a geologic formation known as the Rensselaer Plateau. Hypothesis: spring lake is loaded with fish","completion":"To draw the hypothesis that \\"Spring Lake is loaded with fish\\" from the given context, let's break it down step-by-step. Step 1: Identify relevant information related to our hypothesis in the context - The context states that Spring Lake is a small glacial lake in New York. - The lake is privately administered and has no public access. - It is located on a geologic formation called the Rensselaer Plateau. Step 2: Consider whether the information supports or contradicts our hypothesis - None of the information in the context directly suggests that Spring Lake is loaded with fish. Step 3: Determine if there is any indirect evidence that could support the hypothesis - Since the lake is privately administered and has no public access, it might be possible that the lake is well-maintained, which could support healthy fish populations. - However, this is speculation and not directly stated in the context. Step 4: Conclusion - Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to confidently draw the hypothesis that Spring Lake is loaded with fish. While it might be possible that the lake contains a healthy fish population due to its private administration, the context does not provide direct evidence to support the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Regardless of the way the tension between universities, individual scientists, and the scientific revolution itself is perceived, there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed. Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction, but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting. The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution, and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation, initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines. Instead of entering higher education to become a \\"general scholar\\" immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum, there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself. The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge. Where did students after the scientific revolution put science on the scale of importance?","completion":"After the scientific revolution, students who focused on science started to put science at the top of the scale of importance. They began to view it as a vocation in itself, rather than just being a part of a broader, general education curriculum. This shift in perspective highlighted a divergence between those students who remained committed to the traditional general scholar approach and those who prioritized science and its advancements. This change in prioritization for some students further intensified the epistemological tensions emerging within higher education at the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: A U.S. Navy pilot, Neil Smith (Steve Taschler), is caught in a mysterious storm of butterflies and crash-lands his plane whilst flying over a remote part of Korea. He is found by local villagers who nurse him back to health. In the small village of Dongmakgol, time appears to stand still. They have no knowledge of modern technology, such as firearms, explosives, motor vehicles and aircraft. All villagers are unaware of the massive conflict within Korea. Meanwhile, not far from the village, a platoon of North Korean and South Korean soldiers have an encounter, and the ensuing gunfight leaves most of the North Koreans dead. The surviving soldiers from the North manage to escape through a mountain passage. The North Korean soldiers, Rhee Soo-hwa (Jung Jae-young), Jang Young-hee (Im Ha-ryong), and Seo Taek-gi (Ryu Deok-hwan) are found by an odd girl Yeo-il (Kang Hye-jung) who acts crazy. She leads them to the village, where to their astonishment, they find two South Korean soldiers Pyo Hyun-chul (Shin Ha-kyun) and Moon Sang-sang (Seo Jae-kyung). The South Korean soldiers, who have both deserted their units, had also been led to the village which is housing the injured U.S. Navy pilot, Smith, by a different villager. The unexpected encounter causes an armed standoff that lasts for several days. The villagers have no idea what the stir is about, and wonder why the two sides are standing there pointing those \\"sticks\\" at each other. The confrontation ends only when a soldier holding a grenade is worn by fatigue and accidentally drops it. Another soldier heroically throws himself onto the grenade, but it does not explode. He discards the \\"dud\\" over his shoulder in contempt, and it rolls into the village storehouse and blows up the village's stockpile of corn for the winter.

Answer the following question: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: What does the man make his children do now that he is grown? Options: - not enough information - He makes them rest during a storm. - He makes his children shovel elderly neighbor's sidewalks. - He makes them do homework instead of help neighbors. === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"- not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"Several people with painted faces are standing on a crowded sidewalk.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Some of the people in the crowd are dressed as clowns.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"Some of the people in the crowd are dressed as clowns.\\" from the statement \\"Several people with painted faces are standing on a crowded sidewalk.\\" Let's break this down logically: The initial statement tells us two main things: 1. There are several people with painted faces. 2. These people are standing on a crowded sidewalk. Painting one's face is a fairly common practice for various reasons and in numerous contexts. This could include cultural ceremonies, protests, parties, sports events, and many more. A painted face, on its own, does not identify someone as a clown. Clowns typically have a very specific style of face painting, which includes exaggerated features like oversized lips and eyes, and a combination of particular colors. Even in the context of a costume, a painted face could mean so many things - one could be dressed as a zombie, a superhero, a vampire, a tiger, or even a work of abstract art. Furthermore, it is also entirely possible to have a painted face and be dressed in everyday, casual clothing, meaning the individuals are not necessarily 'dressed up' as anything. The second part of the statement explains that these people with painted faces are standing on a crowded sidewalk. It is important to note that \\"crowded sidewalk\\" is a vague term that doesn't give us any context about the reason the crowd has gathered. It could be for a parade, a protest, a street performance, waiting in line for a popular restaurant or show, or it could just be a particularly busy time of day in a bustling city. Without context, we cannot make assumptions about the nature of the crowd, nor the reason for the face painting. Long story short, simply because several people with painted faces are standing on a crowded sidewalk, it does not automatically mean that some of the people in the crowd are dressed as clowns. For that, we need further information about how they are dressed, how their faces are painted and what the occasion is. Until we have that, any connection to them being clowns is pure speculation, not a logical consequence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Which county contributed less to acid rain formation? Thorn county used fossil fuels for their energy needs, while Plant county used nuclear power. They both polluted the environment in different ways. Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph, Plant county contributed less to acid rain formation as it used nuclear power for their energy needs. While both counties polluted the environment in different ways, it is mentioned that the majority of electricity produced in the U.S. comes from burning coal or other fossil fuels, which leads to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming.

But I can use this background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water.

Finland was more conscious of environmental pollution and took appropriate actions to mitigate its impact, while Russia practiced conventional agriculture, which involved the use of chemical fertilizers. These fertilizers often contribute to marine pollution by introducing excess nutrients and oxygen-depleting chemicals into the ocean through river discharge.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

Music critic J. D.

Jackson's confectionary vocals are masterfully complemented by gentle harmonies and balanced out by pulsing rhythms, so she's never unpleasant to listen to.\\"Matthew Perpetus of Fluxblog suggested Jackson's vocal techniques as a study for indie rock music, considering it to possess \\"a somewhat subliminal effect on the listener, guiding and emphasizing dynamic shifts without distracting attention from its primal hooks.\\" Perpetus added: \\"Her voice effortlessly transitions from a rhythmic toughness to soulful emoting to a flirty softness without overselling any aspect of her performance ... a continuum of emotions and attitudes that add up to the impression that we're listening to the expression of a fully-formed human being with contradictions and complexities.\\"Jackson's music has encompassed a broad range of genres.

Article: A thousand years ago, Hong Kong was covered by a thick forest. As more and more people came to live in Hong Kong, these trees were cut down and burnt. Now there is no forest left, though there are still some small areas covered with trees. We call these woods. Elephants, tigers and many other animals were living in the thick forest. When people came to live in Hong Kong, the animals began to die out. Early farmers grew rice and kept pigs and chickens in the valleys. They cut down the trees and burnt them. They needed fire to keep themselves warm in winter, to cook their food and to keep away the dangerous animals. Elephants quickly disappeared because there was not enough food for them. Many other animals soon died in the same way. You might think that there are no longer any animals in Hong Kong except in 2005. But there are still about 36 different animals living there. One of the most interesting of Hong Kong's animals is the barking deer. These are beautiful little animals with a rich brown coat and a white patch under the tail. They look like deer but they are much smaller. They are less than two feet high. They make a noise rather like a dog barking. In Hong Kong the barking deer has only a real enemy---- men.

Step 1: Understand the nature of the question and context. The question asks for the name given by the Portuguese to the region now known as Mumbai. Mumbai is a city located on the western coast of India and has a rich history of colonial interactions. Step 2: Research the Portuguese presence in India.

Given the question: Question: \\"What riot shaped To Kill a Mockingbird?\\" Context: \\"The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed \\"the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro\\". In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: \\"To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.\\"\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The 1956 riots at the University of Alabama significantly shaped Harper Lee's novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. This event, along with the broader context of racial tension and ongoing civil rights struggles in the American South during the mid-20th century, informed the themes and narrative of the novel. The University of Alabama riots were a reaction to the attempted integration of the institution by Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers, two African-American women who sought to further their education in the face of deeply ingrained social, cultural, and legal barriers. While the legal battle for integration was making progress – thanks to the Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, which declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional – the violent backlash that erupted in the form of riots exemplified the deep-seated racism that persisted in the South. This event provided a backdrop against which Lee could explore broader issues of race and the inhumanity that arises from a society built on racial prejudices and social hierarchies. The trials and tribulations of Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman in To Kill a Mockingbird, reflect the deeply ingrained prejudices and rampant racial injustice that plagued the time period. The experiences of attorney Atticus Finch in the novel, as he tries to provide a fair defense for the accused amidst a hostile environment, mirror the struggles faced by advocates for civil rights and racial equality during the time the novel was written. Lee's portrayal of racial conflict and inequality in her novel seeks to highlight the need for change and progress in a society that still struggled to overcome the legacy of slavery and segregation. By setting the novel in the 1930s but writing it from a 1950s perspective, Lee is able to underscore the ongoing challenges faced by African Americans and the slow pace of reform in race relations over the decades. In addition to the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama, the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955 sparked by Rosa Parks' act of defiance also played an important role in shaping Lee's novel. The boycott, which lasted for over a year, saw African Americans in Montgomery, Alabama, protesting segregated seating on public buses by refusing to use the service, thus crippling the bus system economically and leading eventually to the desegregation of public buses. Overall, To Kill a Mockingbird was heavily influenced by the ongoing struggle for civil rights and racial equality in the mid-20th century American South, with major events such as the University of Alabama riots of 1956 and the Montgomery Bus Boycott providing real-life examples of the racial tensions explored within the novel's narrative. Harper Lee managed to capture the complex emotions and moral challenges faced by individuals and communities during this critical period in US history, using her characters and storylines to create a powerful and enduring critique of societal prejudices and the need for progress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Toru Takemitsu (Wu Man Che , Takemitsu Toru, October 8, 1930 - February 20, 1996) pronounced [takemitsW to:rW] was a Japanese composer and writer on aesthetics and music theory. Largely self-taught, Takemitsu possessed consummate skill in the subtle manipulation of instrumental and orchestral timbre. He is famed for combining elements of oriental and occidental philosophy to create a sound uniquely his own, and for fusing opposites together such as sound with silence and tradition with innovation. He composed several hundred independent works of music, scored more than ninety films and published twenty books. The influence of Olivier Messiaen on Takemitsu was already apparent in some of Takemitsu's earliest published works. By the time he composed Lento in Due Movimenti, (1950), Takemitsu had already come into possession of a copy of Messiaen's 8 Preludes (through Toshi Ichiyanagi), and the influence of Messiaen is clearly visible in the work, in the use of modes, the suspension of regular metre, and sensitivity to timbre. Throughout his career, Takemitsu often made use of modes from which he derived his musical material, both melodic and harmonic among which Messiaen's modes of limited transposition to appear with some frequency. In particular, the use of the octatonic, (mode II, or the 8-28 collection), and mode VI (8-25) is particularly common. However, Takemitsu pointed out that he had used the octatonic collection in his music before ever coming across it in Messiaen's music. In 1975, Takemitsu met Messiaen in New York, and during \\"what was to be a one-hour 'lesson' [but which] lasted three hours ... Messiaen played his Quartet for the End of Time for Takemitsu at the piano\\", which, Takemitsu recalled, was like listening to an orchestral performance. Takemitsu responded to this with his homage to the French composer, Quatrain, for which he asked Messiaen's permission to use the same instrumental combination for the main quartet, cello, violin, clarinet and piano (which is accompanied by orchestra). As well as the obvious similarity of instrumentation, Takemitsu employs several melodic figures that appear to \\"mimic\\" certain musical examples given by Messiaen in his Technique de mon langage musical, (see ex. 4). In 1977, Takemitsu reworked Quatrain for quartet alone, without orchestra, and titled the new work Quatrain II. On hearing of Messiaen's death in 1992, Takemitsu was interviewed by telephone, and still in shock, \\"blurted out, 'His death leaves a crisis in contemporary music!'\\" Then later, in an obituary written for the French composer in the same year, Takemitsu further expressed his sense of loss at Messiaen's death: \\"Truly, he was my spiritual mentor ... Among the many things I learned from his music, the concept and experience of color and the form of time will be unforgettable.\\" The composition Rain Tree Sketch II, which was to be Takemitsu's final piano piece, was also written that year and subtitled \\"In Memoriam Olivier Messiaen\\". Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What happened then?","completion":"In 1975, Toru Takemitsu met Olivier Messiaen in New York for what was supposed to be a one-hour lesson but ended up lasting three hours.

Takemitsu would also compose \\"Quatrain II\\" in 1977 as a reworking of the original piece, this time without an orchestra. When Messiaen passed away in 1992, Takemitsu expressed his profound sense of loss, stating that \\"his death leaves a crisis in contemporary music\\" and referring to Messiaen as his spiritual mentor.

President of Sri Lanka Is Re-elected by Wide Edge COLOMBO, Sri Lanka  Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka’s president, was re-elected by a wide margin, election officials here said Wednesday, defeating the newly retired army general who had tried to lay claim to Mr. Rajapaksa’s biggest political victory, the defeat of the Tamil Tiger insurgency. Official results gave Mr. Rajapaksa an 18-point advantage over his nearest opponent, Sarath Fonseka, the general who carried out the successful military operation against the Tigers. General Fonseka rejected the result, saying that the campaign had been marred by violence and irregularities in the vote counting. “The enthusiasm of the people we noticed in the campaign is not reflected in the result,” he said at a news conference. Independent Sri Lankan election monitors said there was no evidence of major fraud in the voting, but left open the possibility of problems in the counting. More broadly, election observers and advocacy groups have questioned the fundamental fairness of the campaign, accusing Mr. Rajapaksa of using state resources to run his campaign. State-owned news media all but shut out opposition candidates. The election results illustrate the still yawning ethnic and religious divides that plunged Sri Lanka into civil war in the first place, and underscore the difficulties that Mr. Rajapaksa will face in trying to reconcile the country after 26 years of conflict. General Fonseka spent the day secluded in a five-star hotel, which the government surrounded with commandos, saying they had been placed there for security reasons. He said he feared for his safety. “They are trying to make me a prisoner,” General Fonseka said, addressing a conference room packed with journalists. “They have made things very clear today.” Lucien Rajakarunanyake, a government spokesman, rejected the suggestion that General Fonseka was in danger, saying that the troops outside the hotel were merely for his safety. “He is free to leave at any time,” the spokesman said. The Tamil Tiger insurgency fought to create a Tamil homeland in the north and east of Sri Lanka, separate from the Sinhalese majority. But over the years the group became little more than a criminal enterprise famous for its cruel tactics, human rights groups say, like holding civilians as human shields as well as using child soldiers and female suicide bombers. While Mr. Rajapaksa won a big majority, Tamil and Muslim voters largely rejected him. Mr. Rajapaksa pledged to be a president for all Sri Lankans, not just those who voted for him, an apparent effort to reach out to Tamil voters who shunned him in large numbers. “Six million people voted for me,” Mr. Rajapaksa said at a news conference on Wednesday evening. “Even the people who voted for other candidates, I have to look after their interests.” It had been an ugly and sometimes violent campaign between two men who had once been close allies. The evidently exasperated elections commissioner, Dayananda Dissanayake, described numerous transgressions by the government during the campaign, concluding that “state institutions operated in a manner not befitting state organizations.” Guidelines for the state media to behave fairly toward both candidates were ignored, he said, adding that the stress of overseeing the election had taken a toll on his health. A long night of counting ballots confirmed that turnout in northern Tamil areas was very low, in the single digits in some war-hit areas, while voters had flocked to the polls in Mr. Rajapaksa’s southern stronghold. Dayan Jayatilleka, a political analyst who was Sri Lanka’s representative to the United Nations in Geneva until the government fired him last year, said that the Tamil political parties had lost touch with the electorate during the war. “They have been engaging in the politics of exile,” Mr. Jayatilleka said. “They have not done the hard yards of rebuilding their political network.” But election observers said that explosions and other disturbances, along with the heavy militarization of the northern and eastern Tamil areas, had also suppressed the vote. The other political parties in General Fonseka’s coalition also struggled to bring in voters. The center-right United National Party failed to deliver the capital, Colombo  its stronghold  for General Fonseka. And the Marxist party known as the J.V.P., the Sinhalese acronym for People’s Freedom Party, seemed to make little headway against the president in its southern Sinhalese bastions. General Fonseka, who ran on his record of winning the war against the Tamil Tigers, had counted on support from Tamil voters, who he hoped would choose him over Mr. Rajapaksa as the more palatable of the two options. Though General Fonseka led the military campaign that may have killed thousands of Tamil civilians, he portrayed himself as committed to healing ethnic divisions and allowing communities a greater measure of self-rule. He also sought to capitalize on dissatisfaction with Mr. Rajapaksa in some quarters of the Sinhalese majority. Voters expressed concern about the concentration of state power within Mr. Rajapaksa’s family. One of his brothers is the powerful secretary of defense, another is a senior adviser, and many members of his extended family work in senior government positions. But Mr. Rajapaksa emerges from the election in many ways stronger than ever. He ran on his war record, arguing that if he delivered on his pledge to win the war he could also bring a peace dividend and heal the nation’s ethnic rifts. “The president keeps his promises,” said Gamage Banduwathie, a voter who left the United National Party to support Mr. Rajapaksa. “I hope that he will be a savior for Sri Lanka.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The Sri Lankan president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has been re-elected by a wide margin over his nearest opponent, Sarath Fonseka. The victory, confirmed by official results, shows an 18-point advantage for Rajapaksa. Despite the significant win, General Fonseka questioned the validity of the campaign, alluding to election irregularities and violence, views reiterated by some election observers and advocacy groups. However, independent Sri Lankan election monitors found no major proof of fraud. The election results bring out the existing religious and ethnic divisions in Sri Lanka, with Tamil and Muslim voters largely rejecting Rajapaksa. He, nevertheless, pledges to be a president for all Sri Lankans. Rajapaksa's campaign was largely fueled by his victory against the Tamil Tiger insurgency, which had once been led by his opponent Fonseka."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Furthermore, officials used other methods of silencing: riot police officers broke up protests by parents; the authorities set up cordons around the schools; and officials ordered the Chinese news media to stop reporting on school collapses.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"Based on the excerpt from The New York Times, the governments of Beijing and Sichuan claimed that they were actively investigating the causes of building collapse incidents. This series of investigations was an attempt to understand and acknowledge the weaknesses of the established rural building codes, particularly those relating to the construction standards of primary and middle schools in the countryside areas. The National Development and Reform Commission, a powerful agency under the national government in Beijing, further stated on May 27 that it had drafted an amendment in response to the situation. This proposed reform was aimed at improving the construction standards for rural schools. The drafted amendment was passed on to the relevant experts for further review and to ensure its viability, effectiveness, and compliance. In order to maintain social stability and reduce public unrest, officials pursued a strategy of essentially buying silence. Parents were pushed to sign a document in exchange for monetary compensation. This document prohibited them from holding protests against the authorities regarding the school collapses. However, not all parents were willing to accept payment in exchange for their silence. Some who refused to sign were reportedly threatened, indicating a more coercive facet of the government's approach. The compensation offered was variable, though similar, from school to school. For instance, in Hanwang, parents were offered a payment package that included a lump sum of 8,800 USD and a per-parent pension of nearly 5,600 USD. The tactics used by officials to quash protests and control the narrative extended further and included law enforcement and media control. Riot police were implemented to disperse protests led by disgruntled parents. Authorities also cordoned off the areas around the schools that had collapsed. Moreover, the government ordered the Chinese news media to cease reporting on the collapses, an indication of the desire to control the information flow surrounding the incidents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

TMZ reported Tuesday that Lohan's boyfriend, Russian heir Egor Tarabasov, had proposed over the weekend, but LiLo's rep now tells People, \\"The story is untrue and holds no merit.\\" (As of Tuesday night, TMZ was sticking to its guns, reporting that LiLo was sporting an emerald-and-diamond engagement ring.) Lohan, 29, and Tarabasov, a 22-year-old whose businessman father is a multi-millionaire, have been dating about eight months, per People, and have recently moved in together. Tarabasov also spent the holidays in New York with Lohan and her family, per Page Six. \\"He’s older than his years. Being an only child and traveling the world educates you in other ways,\\" Lindsay's mom, Dina, told Page Six last month. Dad Michael's take, around the same time: \\"He has a lot of strong connections in Russia—these are big people and they’re very supportive.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Putting Rumors to Rest: Lindsay Lohan Not Engaged to Egor Tarabasov Contrary to recent media speculations, Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan is not engaged to her Russian boyfriend Egor Tarabasov. The news regarding her engagement, initially reported by TMZ on Tuesday, created a stir, but this has now been firmly refuted by Lohan's representative. The celebrity news platform TMZ had announced that Tarabasov, an heir to a Russian business dynasty, had proposed to Lohan over the past weekend. It further affirmed the allegations by pointing out that she was seen flaunting an emerald-and-diamond ring, presumably an engagement ring. However, a spokesperson for the actress informed People Magazine that \\"The story is untrue and holds no merit.\\" As of Tuesday night, TMZ continues to maintain its position, despite the denials from Lohan's camp. Lindsay Lohan, 29, and Egor Tarabasov, 22, have been in a relationship for approximately eight months, according to People Magazine. Despite the considerable age difference, the couple seems to be genuinely committed to each other. They have recently taken a significant step in their relationship by deciding to move in together. Moreover, the bond appears to extend beyond just the couple. Tarabasov also spent the holidays last year in New York, where he got to know Lohan's family, as reported by Page Six. Lohan's family members have voiced their support and approval of Tarabasov. Dina Lohan, Linsay's mother, provided insight into his maturity during a conversation with Page Six last month, saying, \\"He’s older than his years. Being an only child and traveling the world educates you in other ways.\\" Egor's international experience and broad world view have clearly been taken into consideration by Dina. On the other hand, Lindsay's father, Michael, seemed to be impressed by Tarabasov's strong connections and influential status in Russia. He commented, \\"He has a lot of strong connections in Russia—these are big people and they’re very supportive.\\" Despite such a robust endorsement, it appears we might have to wait some more to hear wedding bells for the duo. In conclusion, for now, the rumors regarding Lindsay Lohan and Egor Tarabasov's engagement can be put to rest. However, given the serious nature of their relationship, we can't rule out future possibilities. For the time being, let's respect their privacy and let their love story unfold organically."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize the following: There is a variety of online calculators that will find your monthly payment and interest paid with the simple input of a few pieces of key information. Try searching for \\"mortgage loan calculator\\" using your preferred search engine. Usually, you'll have to input details of your loan, like the number of years, annual interest rate, and value of your principal. Then, simply hit \\"calculate\\" and the provided readout should tell you anything else you need to know. This can also be a useful way to compare mortgage plans. For example, you may be deciding between a 15-year loan at 6 percent or a 30-year loan at 4 percent. The calculator will help you easily see that, despite the higher interest rate, the 15-year loan is a cheaper option. Keep in mind that online calculators often advertise rates that are much lower than what you can actually get. Therefore, it is best to get rates from an actual lender rather than relying on online mortgage calculators. Similar to the quick method above, this one will allow you to calculate the total interest you will pay on your loans, assuming you already know your monthly payment. However, here you will be multiplying your monthly payment by the number of payments to arrive at a total amount paid over the life of the loan. Start by finding your monthly payments either on a recent bill or on your loan agreement. Then, multiply your monthly payment by your number of payments. Subtract your principal from the total of your payments. This number will represent the total amount you will pay in interest over the life of your loan. For example, imagine you are paying 1,250 per month on a 15-year, 180,000 loan. Multiply 1,250 by your number of payments, 180 (12 payments per year*15 years), to get 225,000. Your total interest paid would then be 225,000 - 180,000, or 45,000.","completion":"Online calculators provide valuable insights when it comes to estimating monthly mortgage payments and total interest paid on loans. By simply entering key information, such as loan duration, principal amount, and annual interest rate, these calculators make it easy to compare different mortgage plans and make informed decisions. When using a search engine to find a suitable mortgage loan calculator, look for one that allows you to input relevant details like the loan term, interest rate, and principal value. Once you've entered this information and hit \\"calculate,\\" the provided results should give you an overview of your monthly payment and interest paid. Using a mortgage calculator can be particularly helpful for comparing different loan options. For instance, if you're choosing between a 15-year loan at 6% interest and a 30-year loan at 4% interest, the calculator will show that despite the higher interest rate, the 15-year loan might be a more cost-effective option in the long run. However, it is essential to note that online calculators sometimes advertise rates that might not accurately represent those offered by actual lenders. As a result, it's crucial to confirm the rates with a real lender to get the most accurate information. In addition to using an online calculator, another method for estimating the total interest paid over the life of the loan requires knowing your monthly mortgage payment. To calculate the total interest, begin by finding your monthly payments on a recent bill or loan agreement, then multiply your monthly payment by the total number of payments. Subtract the principal value from the sum of your payments to arrive at the total interest paid. For example, suppose you're paying 1,250 per month on a 15-year, 180,000 loan. Multiply 1,250 by the number of payments—180 (12 payments/year * 15 years)—to get 225,000. The total interest paid would be 225,000 - 180,000, or 45,000. In conclusion, online mortgage calculators and simple calculation methods can be valuable tools for estimating loan payments and total interest paid. They offer a convenient way to compare mortgage plans and make well-informed decisions. However, it is always best to confirm the rates and information with an actual lender to ensure accuracy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

She preferred curating a relationship on the computer instead of the phone, because the OPT: (A). phone connection was steady. (B). computer connection was steady.","completion":"Option B: computer connection was steady. As Linda sat down on her comfortable chair and switched on her computer, she couldn't help but sigh in relief at the steady, familiar hum of her trusted device. Screens provided a level of reliability and freedom that she always felt was sorely lacking in phone connections. Time and time again, she had encountered choppy signals, dropped calls, and voices that garbled mid-sentence while speaking over the phone - a frustration she found far less frequent when online. This preference was particularly important when it came to cultivating meaningful relationships. Linda had long been absorbed in the notion that the digital realm allowed for connections that transcended physical boundaries. With her computer, she could easily reach out to acquaintances, engage in meaningful, thought-provoking conversations, or even indulge in the occasional debate. Furthermore, the digital connection allowed her to maintain relationships with friends and family in completely different parts of the world. More than that, however, she was able to establish connections with complete strangers, discovering a shared love of particular interests or hobbies. Through forums, social media platforms, and even online games, Linda found camaraderie and understanding that perhaps her immediate surroundings in the physical world could not provide. This was especially important to her, as she sought solace and comfort through these relationships in times of loneliness or despair. Another advantage of curating relationships through her computer was the opportunity to revisit conversations at later times. She could look back at interesting exchanges, playful banter, or deeply heartfelt words of wisdom at will. This was something that a simple phone call did not offer - an intangible, fleeting experience that you couldn't visit time and time again. Furthermore, the textual nature of online communication helped Linda become quite the wordsmith. Carefully crafting her words and sentences, she found that the written communication allowed her to be more eloquent and express her thoughts more coherently. After all, there were countless opportunities to self-correct and edit her words before hitting the 'send' button. Emoticons and animated GIFs proved an invaluable resource for visually expressing her emotions, which, at times, she found hard to convey through words alone. And yet, while her online relationships flourished, Linda couldn't help but grapple with the downsides of her digital escapades. After all, written language could never fully replicate the nuances of tone, pitch, and pace in spoken words—something that telephone conversations could offer. She recognized that the lack of physical presence or voice might create barriers in truly understanding someone, as one couldn't observe a drawn-out sigh or tremble in the voice when recounting a harrowing experience. Despite these nagging imperfections, Linda found solace and fulfillment in the connections she sustained with her computer. She believed that the bonds she created and nurtured through the virtual world were valuable and genuine, even if they lacked the warmth of a friend's touch or the calming familiarity of a loved one's voice. In short, Linda held true to the belief that her computer-aided relationships, with their steady connections, were worth every bit as much as any phone call."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When single father Thurman Williams needed help filling out papers in a custody suit recently, he didn't look to his lawyer for help. He walked to a computerized kiosk at the Lamoreaux Justice Center in Orange and started tapping the keys. As part of a legal experiment, litigants without lawyers across California are using computerized video kiosks to prepare common court filings and seek basic legal advice. The kiosk used by Williams is part of a statewide effort to cope with a flood of litigants who cannot afford or refuse to hire lawyers. Court officials statewide fear the number of self-represented litigants has reached crisis levels and threatens to clog court calendars. Like Williams, more than 6,000 Orange County litigants have initiated court actions on I-CAN! kiosks or accessed the programs on the Internet, using home computers. Similar programs are operating in Sacramento, San Diego and Ventura. A recent study of the kiosks' first 18 months of operation concluded it is too soon to tell if the system will relieve pressure on court calendars. But the report, by UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology, said users were overwhelmingly positive about the free legal assistance. \\"It's made life a lot easier for me,\\" Williams said. \\"It's helped keep me from going to the poorhouse.\\" The 29-year-old Orange resident was directed to a kiosk in the Lamoreaux Justice Center by court staff.

When you scrutinize both the premise and the hypothesis, they hold a similar sentiment.

On the other hand, the hypothesis posits that \\"The president will be encouraged to do the best job he can.\\" This declaration can be seen as a nuanced iteration of the premise, with a subtle shift from \\"a good job\\" to \\"the best job he can.\\" However, these two statements essentially express the same notion that there exists some motivating factor urging the president to give his best in his duties. Therefore, if we accept the premise as true—that there is indeed something that will stimulate the president to do a good job—then it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis would also be true, as it's representative of a similar underlying concept. The president would be inspired to do the best job he can, assuming \\"the best job he can\\" can be seen as synonymous to \\"a good job.\\" There might be some debate on the implied metrics of \\"a good job\\" versus \\"the best job he can,\\" as one might argue that the latter implies maximum effort and capability, which might not be exactly the same as simply doing \\"a good job.\\" However, without additional context or specifications, we would interpret these two phrases as expressing very similar ideas, thus enabling us to conclude on the validity of the hypothesis based on the premise.

The output should be a list of the absolute value of the differences of each two consecutive values. [-11, 45, 80, -98, 71, -29, -7, -20, -4, 47, 88, 7]","completion":"Given the list of integers: [-11, 45, 80, -98, 71, -29, -7, -20, -4, 47, 88, 7], the goal is to find the absolute value of the differences between each pair of consecutive values. Here's the step-by-step calculation: 1. Absolute difference between -11 and 45: abs(-11 - 45) = 56 2. Absolute difference between 45 and 80: abs(45 - 80) = 35 3. Absolute difference between 80 and -98: abs(80 - (-98)) = 178 4. Absolute difference between -98 and 71: abs(-98 - 71) = 169 5. Absolute difference between 71 and -29: abs(71 - (-29)) = 100 6. Absolute difference between -29 and -7: abs(-29 - (-7)) = 22 7. Absolute difference between -7 and -20: abs(-7 - (-20)) = 13 8. Absolute difference between -20 and -4: abs(-20 - (-4)) = 16 9. Absolute difference between -4 and 47: abs(-4 - 47) = 51 10. Absolute difference between 47 and 88: abs(47 - 88) = 41 11. Absolute difference between 88 and 7: abs(88 - 7) = 81 So the output list of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive values is: [56, 35, 178, 169, 100, 22, 13, 16, 51, 41, 81]."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European Leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs. The money is divided into three parts: half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs. What happens when European Leagues sell their televsion rights individually?","completion":"When European Leagues, such as La Liga, sell their television rights individually, it means that each club negotiates and sells its own broadcasting rights. As a result, top clubs with a higher demand for their games tend to receive a much larger share of the total income compared to less popular clubs. This distribution system contrasts with the Premier League's collective selling approach, which allocates television rights revenue with a more balanced distribution among clubs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For this method, you will need salt, purified water, a small clean glass or plastic cup, a large bowl, and ice. If you have a thermometer it would also be useful, but not necessary. Choose from: [A]. Make sure your glass is very clean; any impurities can cause the water to crystallize into ice before supercooling occurs. The bowl must be large enough to contain the glass and enough ice to submerge the glass.; [B]. Boiling water will convert the salt into a carbonated water to add a nutty sensation as it reaches the proper temperature. You can also wet your ice bowl with lukewarm water to keep your salt water from evaporating and contaminating it, but that is not recommended.; [C]. Dissolve some of the salt in water.

Make sure your glass is very clean; any impurities can cause the water to crystallize into ice before supercooling occurs. The bowl must be large enough to contain the glass and enough ice to submerge the glass. B is incorrect because boiling water has nothing to do with supercooling water, and carbonation is not relevant. Wetting the ice bowl with lukewarm water is not helpful either, as the process requires cold temperatures. C is incorrect because it does not provide a logical continuation to the story, nor does it specify the purpose of adding salt to water.

Article: Driving In America Keep Right The traffic follows the \\"keep right rule\\". While driving, drive on the right side of the road. On one-way, multiple lanes road, the right-most lane would be slowest and left-most lane is fastest. Hand Signals Though indicators are used for the purpose of showing which direction you are going, knowing some hand signals is very important and are usually always asked in a driving test. When you want to turn right, you can put your left hand out of the window and point upward. When you want to make a left turn, you can reach your left arm out of the window and point to the left. If you want to slow down or stop, you can just point downward. School Buses Yellow school buses have flashing red lights and stop signs that reach out from the driver's side. The drivers use these warning signals when letting pupils on and off. No matter which side of the road you are traveling on, if you come upon a school bus with its lights flashing and a stop sign used, you must stop. It's the law. Remain stopped until the lights stop flashing or the stop sign is removed. Using the Horn Using horns is not common in America. Actually they are very rarely used.

When selecting a present for someone in Netherlands, don't purchase fancy kitchen knives or scissors. Giving sharp, pointy objects as gifts is considered unlucky. Be careful when presenting flowers to a friend or a business partner in Russia. Yellow blooms suggest cheat or a relationship break up. Traditionally, red carnations are placed on the tombs of the dead. Writing cards or notes while visiting South Korea, be mindful of your pen's ink color1. Writing a person's name in red ink traditionally suggests that the person has passed away--an important point to remember when giving a birthday card. * Eating Customs Being early or on time is viewed as being rude, too eager or even greedy in Venezuela.

It's impossible to say. Although the motor industry accounts for up to 40 per cent of the 450,000 installed industrial robots worldwide, which is a significant portion, it is not sufficient enough to generalize their importance to all factories. The increasing use and expansion of industrial robots in various applications across numerous industries indicate their growing importance; however, it is not a concrete basis to conclude that they are important in all factories. Different industries and factories have varying needs, processes, and requirements for automation. Some may rely heavily on industrial robots, while others may use different automation technologies or may not require automation at all. Moreover, the adoption of industrial robots can also depend on factors such as the scale of the operation, availability of resources, and the existing skill sets of the workforce.

When the Pharaoh discovers the affair, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun assassinate him. Imhotep flees, while Anck-su-Namun kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the resurrection ritual is stopped by Seti's bodyguards, the Medjai. Imhotep's priests are all mummified alive, while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai, the worst of Egyptian curses, buried alive with flesh eating scarab beetles. Imhotep is sealed away in a sarcophagus at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis and kept under strict surveillance by the Medjai to prevent Imhotep's return. In 1926, Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister Evelyn, a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, an intricate box and map, which leads to Hamunaptra. Jonathan reveals he stole the box from an American adventurer, Rick O'Connell, who encountered the city while in the French Foreign Legion. Rick makes a deal with Evelyn to lead them there if they release him from prison. Rick leads Evelyn and her party to the city, where the group encounters a band of American treasure hunters guided by Rick's cowardly colleague Beni Gabor. The expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay. Despite Ardeth's warning of the city's evil, the two expeditions continue to excavate. Evelyn searches for the famous Book of the Living, a book made of pure gold. Instead of finding the book, she, Rick, and Jonathan stumble upon the statue of Anubis and the remains of Imhotep buried underneath.

The band is well known for politically charged lyrics and activism, focusing on anti-war activism, anti-imperialism, class struggle, human rights, and various sociopolitical sentiments. The line-up includes singer/guitarist Justin Sane and drummer Pat Thetic, who founded the band; later members are guitarist Chris Head, and singer/bassist Chris Barker (#2) who replaced Jamie \\"Cock\\" Towns, who had replaced original bassist Andy Flag in 1997 following his departure one year prior. Anti-Flag is known also for their advocacy of progressive political action groups such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. In 2000, Anti-Flag was invited to participate in Vans Warped Tour. During this time, the members of Anti-Flag met NOFX's Fat Mike, owner of the Fat Wreck Chords record label. This meeting spawned a friendship that would lead to Anti-Flag's release of two albums on the label. In 2001, Anti-Flag teamed with punk music producer Mass Giorgini to record the album Underground Network, released on Fat Wreck Chords. The release of the album is arguably the band's breakout from the hardcore underground to a more mainstream spotlight. The album continued to address the issues of fascism (specifically neo-Nazis infiltrating the \\"hardcore scene\\") and the United States' foreign policy. The album was the first to contain the now-commonplace booklet filled with essays from historians and political commentators, most notably Professor Howard Zinn. In February 2002, Anti-Flag released the album Mobilize on A-F Records. The album featured eight new studio tracks as well as eight live tracks of songs from other albums. In the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States, Anti-Flag spoke out against the push for war with the album's title track \\"911 for peace\\". During this time, many music stores pulled Anti-Flag's records from shelves, as their music was labelled as \\"anti-American.\\" In 2003, Anti-Flag released the album The Terror State on Fat Wreck Chords. The album primarily focused on criticizing the Bush Administration's handling of the War on Terrorism. Again, the album contained a booklet full of essays from the band as well as other political commentators. The album contains a song whose lyrics were originally written by Woody Guthrie entitled \\"Post-War Breakout.\\" The track's music was arranged by the members of Anti-Flag, as Guthrie had never committed the arrangements to paper. On October 8, 2004, U.S. Representative Jim McDermott gave a speech in the House of Representatives, praising Anti-Flag for their work in encouraging young people to register and vote. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What other political stances did they promote?","completion":"Anti-Flag is known for promoting various political stances, such as anti-war activism, anti-imperialism, class struggle, human rights, and different sociopolitical sentiments.

Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is: The sun emits solar radiation, which reaches the Earth's surface. Here's a revised and detailed version of the process: 1. The sun emits solar radiation, which consists of visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. This energy travels through space and reaches the Earth's surface. 2. The Earth absorbs much of this incoming solar radiation, heating up its surface and atmosphere. 3. Some of the absorbed energy is re-emitted by the Earth's surface as infrared radiation, which is a form of heat. 4. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and water vapor (H2O), enter the atmosphere from various natural and human-made sources. Examples include the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and natural processes like volcanic eruptions and respiration. 5. The greenhouse gases act like a blanket, absorbing and trapping part of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface within the atmosphere. This trapped heat prevents some of the energy from escaping back into space, causing temperatures within the lower atmosphere to rise. 6. The trapped heat causes various things on Earth, such as air, water, and land, to become warmer than they would be without the increased levels of greenhouse gases. 7. The overall warming of the Earth's surface and atmosphere is called global warming. This, in turn, leads to climate change, which causes various environmental consequences such as changes in weather patterns, sea level rise, and adverse impacts on ecosystems and human societies. In summary, the missing first step is the emission of solar radiation by the sun, which reaches the Earth's surface and initiates the sequence of events that leads to global warming and climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: What city of Vietnam did the French take after Da Nang?","completion":"Title: Historical Skirmishes: The French Occupation of Huế after Da Nang in Vietnam Introduction The interplay of world powers can significantly reshape a nation's cultural and political landscape—a fact patently visible in the timeline of Vietnam during French colonization. After taking over Da Nang, one of the most crucial territories the French seized was the city of Huế. This assertive move had a profound impact on the course of Vietnamese history, entwining the destinies of two entirely disparate cultures. The French Colonization of Vietnam The French colonial era in Vietnam started in the mid-19th century and continued until the mid-20th century. This was a crucial period in Vietnam's history that witnessed many significant events and battles, influencing the nation's cultural, political, and socioeconomic landscape. One such pivotal historical event was the capture of Da Nang by the French forces. Đà Nẵng, previously known as Tourane during French rule, was the first stronghold to capitulate to French colonizers. This strategic city was well-known as the largest urban center in central Vietnam and a noteworthy seaport. Its capture allowed the French to gain a firm foothold in the region, exerting control over both maritime and inland routes. The Capture of Huế Following the occupation of Da Nang, the French sought greater territorial control in the Tonkin region (northern Vietnam). However, to establish this authority, gaining command over the centrally-located city of Huế was deemed necessary. As the imperial capital of the Nguyen Dynasty, Huế was highly significant for its political and symbolical value. In August 1883, French forces launched an attack on the city during the incident known as the 'Carnot Affair'. The French gunboat Lutin sailed up the Perfume River in an attempt to force negotiations with Emperor Tự Đức. However, after the gunboat was fired upon, an enraged Admiral Courbet responded by ordering an attack– thus initiating what would become the Sino-French War. As a result, Emperor Tự Đức was forced to sign the Treaty of Huế, essentially granting the French complete control over northern and central Vietnam. Significance of the Capture The occupation of Huế signaled far more than a mere territorial gain; it implied the subjugation of the imperial Vietnamese power structure. Huế was not merely a city but the cultural and political epicenter of Vietnam, housing the illustrious Forbidden Purple City, akin to China's Forbidden City in Beijing. By exercising control over Huế, the French effectively upended the Nguyen Dynasty's political power, marking a pivotal moment in the history of Vietnam's decolonization. The French went further to underscore their reign by installing a protectorate system, effectively making the Emperor their puppet monarch, subservient to French command. This domination led directly to the era of French Indochina, a federation of Southeast Asian territories under French rule. The Vietnamese were subject to cultural assimilation policies, which intended to replace native Vietnamese cultural, educational, and political institutions with French alternatives. Conclusion The transition of control from Da Nang to the imperial city of Huế sheds light on the strategic progression of the French colonization of Vietnam. Vietnam's past continues to resound in its contemporary life, providing a compelling narrative of cultural resilience in the face of foreign occupation. The post-colonial period infused Vietnam with a unique blend of cultural aesthetics, though coupled with tangible sociopolitical trials and tribulations. Today, cities like Huế stand not only as vestiges of a tumultuous past but also embody the resilience and dynamism integral to Vietnam's national identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning.

But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow.

Choices: - gravity - sunlight - tension - surface A: A:","completion":"To answer this question, it's essential to identify and understand the different types of seismic waves and their effects on structures and the ground. We can then determine which type of wave does the most damage. Step 1: Identify and understand the types of seismic waves Seismic waves are of two types: body waves and surface waves. Body waves are further categorized into P-waves (primary waves) and S-waves (secondary waves). Surface waves are also categorized into two main types: Love waves and Rayleigh waves. Gravity, sunlight, and tension are not types of seismic waves. Step 2: Analyze the effects of each type of seismic wave - P-waves: These waves travel through the Earth's interior and are the fastest. They cause particles to move back and forth in the same direction as the wave, creating a compressional motion with relatively low amplitudes. - S-waves: These are slower than P-waves and cause particles to move perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. They create a shearing motion and are more destructive than P-waves, but their damage is typically limited to a smaller area. - Love waves: These surface waves cause horizontal, back-and-forth movement and are found on solid ground. They can result in significant damage to structures, particularly those with weaker lateral strength. - Rayleigh waves: These surface waves cause both vertical and horizontal movement in a rolling motion. They are the slowest of all seismic waves and can cause extensive damage to structures due to their larger amplitudes and persistent shaking. Step 3: Determine which type of seismic wave does the most damage Based on the analysis, surface waves (Love and Rayleigh waves) generally cause the most damage to structures and the ground, with Rayleigh waves having the potential to be the most destructive due to their larger amplitudes and persistent shaking. So the answer is: A: Surface"},{"prompt":"Context: Addison wasn't paying much attention. They got into a car accident. Question: What will Addison want to do next?

In this case, we have the constants 31 and -10. Add them together to get the simplified constant: 0 = 7*g + 21 Step 2: Isolate the variable Now, we want to get g by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to remove the 21 from the right side of the equation. Since 21 is added to 7*g, we need to subtract 21 from both sides of the equation to eliminate it: 0 - 21 = 7*g + 21 - 21 -21 = 7*g Step 3: Solve for the variable Now that we have isolated the variable, we can solve for g. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 7: -21 / 7 = 7 * g / 7 -3 = g The solution to the equation is g = -3."},{"prompt":"Is this product review positive?

These growth indicators are essential for understanding the progress and success of any economic or business venture. Here, I will provide a detailed analysis of each of these indicators. 1. Number of funders: The number of funders (or investors) is an essential indicator of growth as it reflects the level of confidence and interest from the public in the venture. A high number of funders suggests strong financial support, which can lead to increased business opportunities and expanded market presence. On the other hand, a low number of funders may imply issues with the venture's prospects or management, affecting its overall growth potential. 2. Amount of resources mobilized: The quantity of resources, such as financial, human, and technical, mobilized by the organization or project depicts its ability to attract and manage resources effectively. Greater mobilization of resources usually indicates better growth prospects, as it allows the organization to undertake more significant projects, expand its reach, and develop new products or services. A lack of resources or their improper management can restrict the growth of an organization, limiting its potential to scale up or advance in its market. 3. Assets: Assets refer to the economic resources owned by a business that have value and can be utilized for the organization's benefit. These include tangible assets, like equipment, buildings, and inventory, and intangible assets, such as intellectual property, patents, and trademarks. Tracking an organization's assets over time provides insights into its financial health and stability, directly impacting growth. An increase in the value or volume of assets might indicate a successful expansion strategy, while a decrease could imply potential financial troubles. 4. Revenues: Revenues are the funds received by an organization from its business operations, such as the sale of goods, provision of services, or interest earned on investments. It is one of the most critical measures of growth, as rising revenues indicate a growing customer base, increased demand for products or services, and successful marketing efforts. Conversely, declining or stagnant revenues can imply problems with the organization's product quality, pricing, or customer satisfaction levels, which can hinder growth. In summary, considering these four growth indicators – the number of funders, the amount of resources mobilized, assets, and revenues – can provide valuable insights into the success and development of an organization or project. Monitoring and evaluating these metrics can help identify areas of strength or potential issues, allowing for better decision-making and strategic planning, ultimately leading to improved growth prospects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was designed by Chicago-based architecture firm Pappageorge Haymes, Ltd. and is located in the Near South Side community area. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Agricultural productivity is measured as the ratio of agricultural outputs to agricultural inputs. While individual products are usually measured by weight, their varying densities make measuring overall agricultural output difficult. Therefore, output is usually measured as the market value of final output, which excludes intermediate products such as corn feed used in the meat industry. This output value may be compared to many different types of inputs such as labour and land (yield). These are called partial measures of productivity. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America.

It is operated by the City of Chicago Department of Aviation. - The Port of Chicago consists of several major port facilities within the city of Chicago, Illinois operated by the Illinois International Port District (formerly known as the Chicago Regional Port District). The central element of the Port District, Calumet Harbor, is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. - Natural resources are resources that exist without actions of humankind. This includes all valued characteristics such as magnetic, gravitational, and electrical properties and forces. On earth it includes: sunlight, atmosphere, water, land (includes all minerals) along with all vegetation and animal life that naturally subsists upon or within the heretofore identified characteristics and substances. - The Illinois River is a principal tributary of the Mississippi River, approximately long, in the U.S. state of Illinois. The river drains a large section of central Illinois, with a drainage basin of . The drainage basin extends into Wisconsin and Indiana. This river was important among Native Americans and early French traders as the principal water route connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi. The French colonial settlements along the river formed the heart of the area known as the Illinois Country. After the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the Hennepin Canal in the 19th century, the role of the river as link between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi was extended into the era of modern industrial shipping. It now forms the basis for the Illinois Waterway. - A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building having multiple floors.

One, Lieutenant Drake, from a middle-class background, is extremely eager to fit in while the other, Lieutenant Millington, the son of a general, is keen to get out as soon as possible and deliberately antagonizes his fellow officers. The two newcomers learn the traditions of the regiment, one of which is a mess game in which they chase a wooden pig on wheels, attempting to pierce its anus with their swords. Mrs Scarlett, the flirtatious and attractive widow of a captain who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, is a constant presence in the regiment. One night at a mess dance, Millington gets drunk and tries to seduce Mrs Scarlett in the garden. She repels him, but moments later runs back into the mess wounded and in shock, claiming the culprit was Millington. An informal court martial -more a mock trial than anything else- is organized with Drake ordered to be Millington's defending officer. Although Drake is pressured by his superior officer to plead guilty for Millington and close the case quickly, he begins to challenge the orders in order to give the defendant a fair trial. Drake learns from an Indian servant that another widow suffered a similar attack with a sword six months earlier, before he and Millington joined.

Write the answer: Who succeeded Sir William Howe as Commander in Chief of the British forces in 1778 during the American War of Independence?","completion":"Sir Henry Clinton succeeded Sir William Howe as Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in 1778 during the American War of Independence. Born in 1730, Sir Henry Clinton came from a prominent military family. His father, Admiral George Clinton, served as the colonial governor of Newfoundland and later New York, and his mother’s family had connections with influential people in the British Army. Sir Henry's military career began in the 1740s, when he participated in the War of the Austrian Succession. He proceeded to serve in the Seven Years' War, holding different positions in the British Army, which honed his skills as a strategic commander. In 1772, Clinton became a Major General, thereby cementing his place in the upper ranks of the British military. When the American War of Independence erupted in 1775, Clinton was dispatched to help suppress the growing rebellion. During the early years of the conflict, he served as second-in-command under General Thomas Gage and later General William Howe. Clinton played a crucial role in several key battles, including the Battle of Bunker Hill. Despite experiencing challenges and setbacks, Clinton's abilities as a military leader were widely recognized, resulting in his promotion to the position of Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in America on February 12, 1778, following Sir William Howe's resignation. At the time, the war had reached a critical juncture, with British forces seemingly stuck in a stalemate against the Continental Army. Once in command, Sir Henry Clinton faced constant trials both on and off the battlefield. He had to contend with an inadequately equipped and under-supported army. Moreover, the revolutionaries sought and received strategic assistance from France, Spain, and the Dutch, further complicating the conflict for Clinton and the British military. During his tenure as Commander-in-Chief, Clinton put forth numerous strategies that did result in victories for the British forces. In particular, he spearheaded a successful campaign to focus on the southern colonies. He captured Savannah in Georgia and then secured an important victory at Charleston in South Carolina in the spring of 1780. Nevertheless, the war's overall trajectory did not change much in the British favor. As the conflict dragged on, Clinton became increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress. He received orders from London to defend British territories from French, Spanish, and Dutch attacks, which further undermined his ability to decisively defeat the colonial forces. By 1781, relations between Clinton and his second-in-command, General Charles Cornwallis, became strained as their strategies and expectations diverged. When the decisive Battle of Yorktown, which essentially sealed the fate of the British cause, took place in October 1781, Clinton was seen as culpable in the loss. His inability to provide support to Cornwallis, who surrendered to George Washington, facilitated the British defeat in North America. Sir Henry Clinton eventually returned to England in 1782, replaced by Sir Guy Carleton as Commander-in-Chief. Clinton's reputation was tarnished by the failure to maintain British control over the American colonies, and his superiors in London held him partly responsible for the loss. Sir Henry Clinton went on to serve as a Member of Parliament and held subsequent military roles, passing away in December 1795."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Options: - broom - effort - vacuuming - boredom - mop Explain why a human would choose \\"vacuuming\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"vacuuming\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Effectiveness: Vacuuming is the most effective option among the choices for removing dirt from a carpet. A vacuum cleaner is specifically designed for this purpose, and it can effectively remove dirt, dust, and small debris from carpets. 2. Deep cleaning: Unlike brooms or mops, vacuum cleaners can reach deeper into the carpet fibers, ensuring a more thorough cleaning. This helps in maintaining the carpet's appearance and improving the indoor air quality. 3. Convenience: Vacuuming is a more convenient option compared to using a broom or a mop. Vacuum cleaners usually come with various attachments and settings, allowing humans to tackle different types of dirt and different surfaces with ease. Furthermore, vacuum cleaners can be maneuvered easily and require less physical effort compared to sweeping with a broom. 4. Efficiency: Vacuum cleaners are more efficient at cleaning carpets than brooms or mops because they have a higher rate of dirt collection. Using a vacuum cleaner can save time and energy, compared to sweeping with a broom or using a mop that may not be effective on carpets. 5. Irrelevant options: The other options available, such as effort and boredom, are not relevant to the task of removing dirt from a carpet. Effort is a requirement for any task, but it does not specifically address the method to be used. Boredom is an emotional state and not relevant to the task at hand.

How do you do this: To dice apples,","completion":"Dicing apples is a common preparation technique used in various recipes like fruit salads, pies, and crumbles, or even just for snacking. Following these steps will help you dice apples with ease: 1. Gather your materials: To dice apples, you will need a cutting board, a sharp knife (preferably a chef's knife or paring knife), a fruit peeler, and a bowl or container to store the diced apples. Optionally, you may want to have lemon juice or saltwater handy to prevent the apples from browning, if you're not using them right away. 2. Wash the apples: Begin by thoroughly rinsing the apples under cool running water to remove any dirt or chemical residue. You can also use a clean, damp cloth or a produce wash, but make sure to rinse well. 3. Peel the apples (optional): Depending on your preference or the recipe's requirement, you can choose to peel the apples. Hold the apple firmly in one hand and carefully use the fruit peeler to remove the outer skin in a continuous, downward motion. Rotate the apple as you peel the skin to cover the entire surface. 4. Cut the apple in half: Using a chef's knife, carefully slice the apple vertically in half, cutting through the core. Make sure you have a firm grip on the apple and cut with a smooth, downward motion. 5. Remove the core: Place each apple half flat-side down on the cutting board. Carefully cut around the core of the apple at an angle to remove the entire core and seeds. Alternatively, you can use an apple corer or a small paring knife to remove the core. Be sure to eliminate any additional seeds or tough parts near the core. 6. Slice the apple halves: Place the apple halves flat-side down on the cutting board. With your fingers safely away from the blade, cut each apple half into even vertical slices, depending on the desired thickness. (Commonly, 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices are ideal.) 7. Dice the apple slices: Take the sliced apple pieces and arrange them in a stack. With your fingers still safely away from the blade, cut the stack into even, small square pieces. Aim for a uniform size to ensure even cooking or easy eating. 8. Prevent browning: Apples can quickly turn brown due to oxidation once they're cut. To avoid this, you can either use the diced apples immediately or place them in a bowl of cold water mixed with a tablespoon of lemon juice or a pinch of salt. This will help to slow down the browning process. 9. Store the diced apples: If you're not using the diced apples right away, drain them from the lemon juice or saltwater and store them in an airtight container or resealable plastic bag in the refrigerator. They can be stored like this for up to a couple of days. Following these steps will help you successfully dice apples for a variety of recipes. Remember always to use caution while handling sharp knives and to wash your hands and equipment well before and after the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The","completion":"sun was setting in the horizon, bathing the grove in reddish-orange hues as James headed towards it. He navigated his way through the rows of apple trees, their lush greens contrasted with the orange and reds of the setting sun. Finally, he arrived at the orange grove situated on the hillside. The sight that greeted him was magnificent, with countless orange fruits nestling among beautiful green leaves, sparkling in the dusky glow as if thousand lanterns were lit. James had always been selective about the food he consumed. The apple he had plucked last week was ripe and fresh, yet it held no appeal to him. He had an idiosyncratic belief that the taste of a fruit is somehow connected to when it gets plucked. The apple, for him, carried the taste of last week. Fresh, yes - but old nonetheless. Now, he was yearning for a new taste, a new week - and a newly plucked orange was going to offer him that zest. His eyes expertly scanned the trees, searching for the ripest and most appealing of the oranges. One tree towards the far end of the grove particularly stood out. The oranges hanging from its branches were the exact color of the sublime sunset, and they were surely the sweetest. The tree was old and wise, its gnarled branches arching down with the weight of delicious sunbeams trapped within the skin of each fruit. He ambled over, deciding to choose an orange from this old, wise creature. Without delaying any further, James extended his arm upward, fingers extended towards the cluster of oranges hanging tantalisingly just out of his reach. He stepped onto the lowest branch of the tree, the bark rough against his bare feet, but he didn't mind. He went through this ritual every time he picked a fruit, as if paying his respect to the tree which was bestowing upon him its bounty. It was their silent agreement. Finally, his fingers made contact with a particularly plump orange, it appeared to be bursting with juice, just asking to be picked. He gently twisted and tugged it from its branch. It came off smoothly, the stalk releasing the orange as if knowing it was time to let go. He held the orange in his hands, its citrusy fragrance wafting up. It was slightly warm from the sun, perfectly ripe, and of this week, void of the staleness of the past. He sat down under the tree and started peeling the orange, the rind giving away easily, releasing fresh citrus spritzes into the air. The sections looked juicy and succulent, promising a tangy, sweet flavor. As he bit into the first segment, the juice burst in his mouth, flooding his senses with fresh, tangy sweetness - just the way he wanted. Savoring the taste of the orange under the slowly darkening sky, he felt a profound sense of contentment wash over him. The taste of a new week was delicious indeed. His ritual of respecting the trees and picking the freshest fruit somehow brought a certain essence into his life that he cherished. Just as the last rays of the sun bid adieu to the day, leaving the sky adorned with stars, James stood up. He thanked the tree as he always did and walked back towards his house, feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and ready to face a brand-new week. The apple of last week was forgotten. Today, he had tasted the orange of a new week. And tomorrow? Who knew which fruit would call to him. But whatever it was, it would be fresh, and it would be of a new day. For in his quest for harvesting the freshest of fruits, James found his way of living a life full of freshness, discarding each day's staleness with the setting sun and welcoming the novelty with the break of dawn."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The world number four parted ways with Fitzgerald having failed to win a major since 2014, his management said. The move comes a week after McIlroy thanked his bagman for jolting him into gear after a poor start to The Open. McIlroy, 28, is due to speak to the media on Wednesday, before the WGC Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio. \\"He has taken me from 200 in the world to major champion,\\" McIlroy said of Fitzgerald in 2011. The pair started working together shortly after McIlroy turned professional in 2008. They enjoyed a brilliantly successful partnership as McIlroy took over from Tiger Woods as the game's dominant force and became world number one. McIlroy heaped praise on Fitzgerald at this month's Open at Royal Birkdale, saying he had delivered some blunt words after the Holywood player started the tournament with a string of bogeys. After fighting back to shoot a one-over 71 in the first round, McIlroy told reporters Fitzgerald had done a \\"great job\\". The Open was Fitzgerald's swansong with McIlroy, who flirted with contention in the final round before finishing equal fourth. Forbes estimated Fitzgerald earned 1.65 million from his cut of McIlroy's prize money over the 12 months to June this year.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who is often described as looking at herself on the mirror in the work? , can you please find it? The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.

Born in Scotland on 15 June 1792, he was son of John Mitchell of Carron Works and was brought up from childhood by his uncle, Thomas Livingstone of Parkhall, Stirlingshire. On the death of his uncle, he joined the British army in Portugal as a volunteer, at the age of sixteen. On 24 June 1811, at the age of nineteen, he received his first commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles (later the Rifle Brigade / Royal Green Jackets). Utilising his skills as a draughtsman of outstanding ability, he was occasionally employed in the Quartermaster-General's department under Sir George Murray. In 1831 a runaway convict named George Clarke, who had lived with Aborigines in the area for several years, claimed that a large river called Kindur flowed north-west from the Liverpool ranges in New South Wales to the sea. Charles Sturt believed that the Murray-Darling system formed the main river system of New South Wales and Mitchell wanted to prove Sturt wrong. Mitchell formed an expedition consisting of himself, assistant surveyor George Boyle White and 15 convicts who were promised remission for good conduct. Mitchell took 20 bullocks, three heavy drays, three light carts and nine horses to carry supplies, and set out on 24 November 1831 to investigate the claim. On reaching Wollombi in the Hunter Valley, the local assistant surveyor, Heneage Finch, expressed a desire to join the expedition. He had established his credentials by surveying a route from Sydney to Wollombi, so Mitchell approved his request, provided he obtained extra supplies and men, and he followed along later. The expedition continued northward, climbed the Liverpool Range on 5 December, and made Quirindi on 8 December. Shortly afterwards Finch arrived but inexplicably had not brought provisions, so Mitchell immediately sent him back to get them. By 11 December the expedition had reached Wallamoul Station near Tamworth, the northern extent of white settlement at the time. Mitchell continued his northward push into new territory, taking local Kamilaroi people to assist in finding water and to express his peaceful intentions. By early January 1832 he was in the vicinity of the present town of Narrabri, reached the Gwydir River in mid-January, and found the Barwon by the end of the month, where he set up camp. Mitchell left the main party and made a reconnaissance down the Barwon until he found its junction with the Gwydir. After Mitchell returned to the main camp, Finch arrived with tragic news. He had been travelling with three convicts and provisions but, because of a shortage of water, the group had separated. He left two men behind while he attempted to locate the main expedition. Having failed to do that, on the second day he returned to the campsite to discover that it had been ransacked. Supplies were scattered and beneath the wreckage were two dead men. The immediate effect was that Mitchell decided to abandon the expedition and return south. The party reached the Gwydir on 8 February and was near the site of the attack on 17 February. Mitchell buried the two bodies and salvaged some equipment. Once back at Wallamoul, Mitchell placed White in charge of the main party, while he returned hastily to Sydney. He was satisfied that there was no truth about the river Kindur claimed by Clarke. Fourteen years after the attack, Mitchell revealed that the convicts had indulged in sexual relations with Aboriginal women.

Henry Jaynes Fonda (May 16, 1905 - August 12, 1982) was an American film and stage actor with a career spanning five decades. Fonda made his mark early as a Broadway actor. He also appeared in 1938 in plays performed in White Plains, New York, with Joan Tompkins. He made his Hollywood debut in 1935, and his career gained momentum after his Academy Award-nominated performance as Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, a 1940 adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel about an Oklahoma family who moved west during the Dust Bowl. Born in Grand Island, Nebraska in May 1905, Henry Jaynes Fonda was the son of printer William Brace Fonda, and his wife, Herberta (Jaynes). The family moved to Omaha, Nebraska in 1906. Fonda's patrilineal line originates with an ancestor from Genoa, Italy, who migrated to the Netherlands in the 15th century. In 1642, a branch of the Fonda family immigrated to the Dutch colony of New Netherland on the East Coast of North America. They were among the first Dutch population to settle in what is now upstate New York, establishing the town of Fonda, New York. By 1888, many of their descendants had relocated to Nebraska. Fonda was brought up as a Christian Scientist, though he was baptized an Episcopalian at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Grand Island. He said, \\"My whole damn family was nice.\\" They were a close family and highly supportive, especially in health matters, as they avoided doctors due to their religion. Despite having a religious background, he later became an agnostic. Fonda was a bashful, short boy who tended to avoid girls, except his sisters, and was a good skater, swimmer, and runner. He worked part-time in his father's print plant and imagined a possible career as a journalist. Later, he worked after school for the phone company. He also enjoyed drawing. Fonda was active in the Boy Scouts of America; Teichmann reports that he reached the rank of Eagle Scout. However, this is denied elsewhere. When he was about 14, his father took him to observe the brutal lynching of Will Brown during the Omaha race riot of 1919. This enraged the young Fonda and he kept a keen awareness of prejudice for the rest of his life. By his senior year in high school, Fonda had grown to more than six feet tall, but remained shy. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he majored in journalism, but he did not graduate. He took a job with the Retail Credit Company.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 6 Killer Google Chrome Extensions for Social Media Addicts About a year ago, Google launched Chrome, their super fast, open source web browser. Since then it has grabbed just over three and a half percent of the world’s web browser market, according to Net Applications. That’s not bad, but still puts Chrome firmly in fourth place behind Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari. One of the reasons why Chrome has been stuck in fourth place: extensions — Chrome hasn’t got them. Or more precisely, ChromeChrome doesn’t have them yet. At least, not officially. If you ask most FirefoxFirefox fans the main reason they won’t switch to Chrome, a good majority of them will probably cite its lack of extensions. But that might change, because Chrome extensions are coming — perhaps soon. And for users of the developer’s build of Chrome, they’re already here. So for those of you brave enough to use the unstable developers release of Chrome, here are 6 extensions that social media addicts will want to install. Chrome only has extensions enabled in the developer release. To get that release, you have to subscribe to the Chrome Dev Channel. Once you’ve downloaded the developer’s version of the browser, you can begin to install extensions. For now, the best place to find and install extensions is probably from the ChromeExtensions.org directory, which offers one-click installation of extensions from its categorized listing. You can also find extensions via the ChromePlugins.org and GoogleChromePlugins.com forum communities, and via the My Chrome Addons blog. However, GoogleGoogle has recently dropped hints that an official extensions gallery may be coming soon, which also indicates that support for extensions in the stable release of Chrome might be right around the corner. Once you’ve installed some extensions, you can manage them by navigating to chrome://extensions in the address bar or clicking on ‘Extensions’ in the tools menu. Chrome extensions are still a very new animal, and Chrome’s developer build changes frequently, so be prepared for the extensions listed below to break on occasion. Staying up-to-date with email is one of the most important tasks for social media fanatics, and Chrome makes that task easier for GmailGmail users with the Gmail Checker extension. It’s one of Google’s official sample extensions and adds an indicator icon next to the address bar in Chrome that shows you how many unread messages you have in Gmail. The extension only works if you’re logged into Gmail, but that’s nice because it means you don’t actually have to share your password with any third-party. There are a bunch of TwitterTwitter extensions for Chrome, but the best one might be Chromed Bird. It’s a fairly polished extension that lets you read and reply to tweets directly from within Chrome. It worked very well in my testing today, though you do have to share your username and password with the app (no OAuth support). Chromed Bird’s icon changes color when you have new tweets waiting, which is a nice visual cue, but the extension has no support for @reply or DM notifications, even though it has (non-working) tabs in the UI for filtering those types of messages. In all, Chromed Bird is very barebones, but functional as a basic, in-browser Twitter client. You should also check out Metrist, which is highly rated, but in Chinese (and I couldn’t get it to work properly). If you’re less concerned with tweeting, but would rather just stay up-to-date with tweets in your stream, then Twitter Ticker is a great extension to have. Once installed, the addon will scroll tweets in the bottom status bar of the browser as they happen. Holding your mouse over the scroll will pause it. On its own, that’s not very impressive, but when used in tandem with Chrome Bird — which, lacks advanced tweet notifications — Twitter Ticker is definitely very useful. Micro Last.fm is a very simple set of controls for Last.fm radio. It certainly lives up to its name by offering a super tiny UI that lives in the bottom status bar in Chrome. One of the nicest things about Micro Last.fm is that it doesn’t need your login credentials — and you don’t even need to be logged into Last.fm for it to work! The extension functions by opening up Last.fm radio in a new tab in Chrome, and then linking itself to that tab so you can control the radio station. There are a bunch of Google ReaderGoogle Reader addons for Chrome, but most just display your unread count or allow you to subscribe to feeds in Reader more easily. TPGoogleReader does a lot more than that, however. Made by the same person as Micro Last.fm, it is one of the most complete Google Reader extensions currently available for Chrome. Perhaps its most compelling feature is that you can set it to automatically open stories in a new tab in Chrome as they come into Google Reader and mark them as read. For heavy RSS readers that might be a nightmare, but for those subscribed in Google Reader to just a handful of feeds, the feature offers a way to get news pushed to you as it happens throughout the day without ever having to actually visit Google. Also check out Google Reader Checker, which just checks Reader for unread items, but does it in an elegant way. Facebook Notification Checker works just like Gmail Checker, but for FacebookFacebook. It adds an icon next to the address bar in Chrome that alerts you to new notifications in Facebook. In my testing it was a little finicky and didn’t always catch new notifications, but for avid Facebook users it will nonetheless be useful. One of the nicest features of Facebook Notification Checker is that it doesn’t require you to give it your username and password — you just need to be logged into Facebook in order for it to work.

The trilogy consists of Unbreakable (2000), Split (2016), and Glass (2019). is the movie split part of a trilogy?","completion":"Yes, the movie Split (2016) is part of a trilogy known as the Unbreakable film series or the Eastrail 177 Trilogy. This trilogy was written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, a renowned filmmaker known for his unique storytelling and suspenseful plots. The trilogy consists of the following films: 1. Unbreakable (2000): The first installment of the series, Unbreakable, introduces the audience to the character David Dunn (played by Bruce Willis), a security guard who discovers that he possesses immense strength and supernatural abilities after surviving a catastrophic train accident. This film also introduces the character of Elijah Price, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, who is a comic book enthusiast born with a rare genetic disorder that renders his bones extremely fragile. Elijah believes that superheroes exist among us and becomes convinced that David is one of them, leading to a complex and intriguing relationship between the two characters. 2. Split (2016): The second part of the trilogy, Split, presents an entirely new set of characters. The primary focus is on Kevin Wendell Crumb (played by James McAvoy), a man suffering from dissociative identity disorder who has 24 distinct personalities. The most dangerous of them all is \\"The Beast,\\" a supernatural entity with exceptional physical prowess and a desire to cleanse the world by eliminating those who have not experienced suffering. The film follows Kevin as he kidnaps three teenage girls and their struggle to escape before the Beast emerges. It is not immediately apparent that Split is connected to Unbreakable until the final moments of the film, when Bruce Willis makes a brief cameo as David Dunn, tying the two movies together. 3. Glass (2019): The final chapter of the trilogy, Glass, unites the main characters from both Unbreakable and Split. David Dunn, now a vigilante known as \\"The Overseer,\\" attempts to stop Kevin Wendell Crumb, who is on a crime spree as his Beast persona. During their confrontation, both individuals are apprehended and taken to a psychiatric facility, where they encounter Elijah Price once again. The three are monitored by Dr. Ellie Staple (played by Sarah Paulson), who aims to convince them that their superhuman abilities are merely delusions. However, Elijah Price, also known by his self-proclaimed supervillain name \\"Mr. Glass,\\" devises a master plan to reveal the truth about their powers to the world, leading to a thrilling and unexpected conclusion. All three films, Unbreakable, Split, and Glass, form a cohesive narrative that explores the complex nature of superheroes and supervillains, and how ordinary people might grapple with extraordinary abilities. The Eastrail 177 Trilogy offers a unique and grounded take on the burgeoning superhero genre, challenging viewers' preconceived notions of good and evil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Hamilton Beach seemed the best and I have put it to the test for almost two years. It is slighly smaller than the Faberware(not made anymore) but does have a rotisserie which works wonderfully. I put whole chicken fryers, chicken breasts, and 3-5 lb pork loins on it. Mouth watering good!! It does cook much faster than an oven and because of this and it energy savings my oven is never used. Two minuses would be the door opens down from the top and not from the side so you run the risk of dropping something on it and breaking it and it also does not seal well but does not seem to affect cooking.

What is the answer: On which fictional planet was Superman born?","completion":"Superman was born on the fictional planet of Krypton. Krypton is a crucial aspect of Superman's origin story, explaining his unique abilities and character development. Krypton is often depicted as an advanced and highly intelligent civilization, teeming with sophisticated technology, impressive architecture, and scientifically advanced inhabitants. The planet was located approximately 27.1 light-years from Earth in the star system of Rao, orbiting its red sun. It was similar to Earth in terms of both its physical environment and habitability, allowing for the eventual adaptation of Superman to our planet. In most interpretations of the Superman story, Krypton's society was divided into distinct social and scientific guilds. The inhabitants of Krypton were genetically compatible with humans, but were endowed with superhuman abilities when exposed to the radiation of a yellow sun, such as Earth's. This transformation was a keystone of the narrative, whereby Kal-El, Superman's birth name, acquires his incredible power-set upon arriving at Earth. Though Krypton was a utopia in many senses, it faced its own set of issues. One of the central themes in the story of Superman is the destruction of Krypton, leading to his arrival on Earth. Jor-El, Superman’s father, was an eminent scientist who foresaw the planet's impending doom but was unable to convince the ruling council about the danger it faced. The planet's core became increasingly unstable due to intense pressures and the consumption of its natural resources - specifically a substance known as Kryptonite. Knowing that Krypton's time was running out, Jor-El and his wife, Lara Lor-Van, built a spacecraft for their infant son, Kal-El. They made the heartrending choice to send him away, to protect him from the cataclysmic end approaching their home planet. Thus, Kal-El was launched into space, and eventually found his way to Earth. The couple's selfless decision is a fundamental part of the Superman mythos, highlighting themes of sacrifice and love. After arriving on Earth, Superman, under the human guise of Clark Kent, learns about his connection to Krypton through various forms of Kryptonian technology left behind by his late parents. The legacy of Krypton ultimately becomes a driving force in Superman's life, shaping his values, identity, and purpose. In essence, Krypton is fundamental to the Superman story. Its history, culture, and eventual destruction provide the backdrop against which the character of Superman is created, highlighting the importance of morality, family, and social responsibility. Krypton’s destruction serves as a constant reminder to Superman - and readers alike - that life is delicate and that one's origins can be a powerful catalyst for personal growth and action."},{"prompt":"What is the place teenagers hate to go to most but have the most incentive to attend?

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond promised a rigorous investigation into the accident. The city council said it would survey all similar walls in its schools as a \\"precaution\\". Prime Minister David Cameron described the incident as a ''shocking accident'' and said any lessons would have to be learnt. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, he said \\"This was an absolutely shocking accident that people will have seen across the country. And their hearts will go out to the family, and all those involved at the school. \\"Clearly the lessons will have to be learnt to make sure tragic accidents like this can't happen again.\\" The free-standing modesty wall served as a partition to give pupils privacy when showering in gym changing rooms. In a statement on Tuesday night, the City of Edinburgh Council said the wall had been checked within the past two years and no problems identified. Pupils were sent home after the incident, which happened just before 10:00 BST on Tuesday, and the school is to remain closed for the rest of the week. Building surveyors will carry out a full check at the school before pupils return after the Easter break. Police will meet officials from the Health and Safety Executive later to discuss who will investigate the incident. Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill, who is an Edinburgh MSP, said Liberton High School has had \\"difficulties with fragmenting and fraying to the fabric\\" of the building. But he said he did not believe there were problems with health and safety at the school, or that squeezes on the council's education budget were hindering school renovation projects. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \\"I think the council are doing a good job. They are working their way through the school estate. Many schools are being replaced, particular actions were taken in every school where there was a requirement. \\"The city council has always put the safety of pupils paramount. That is why I welcome their review to ensure that the situation is safe in every school. \\"There are challenges, they do have to prioritise, but I do believe that they have been doing the correct job.\\" Mr MacAskill said it had been a \\"double blow\\" for the school after the death of fellow pupil Jamie Skinner, 13, who collapsed while playing football for Tynecastle FC at the end of last year. Floral tributes have been left outside the school, with one bunch including a card that read: \\"Rest in peace Keane. God has gained another angel.\\" One pupil at the school, 13-year-old Devon Blyth, told the BBC she had warned a teacher some months ago that there was an unstable wall in the girl's changing room near the old gym - where the incident took place. In February, Edinburgh City Council was fined Â£8,000 after a pupil received serious injuries when she fell down a lift shaft at Liberton High School, in December 2011. The school, which has about 650 pupils, was built in 1959, and the PE accommodation was refurbished in the mid-1980s. A report prepared for the council in December 2013 recommended a programme of repairs to the school buildings, although there was no indication of structural work being required. A council statement on Tuesday evening said: \\"A full survey of all our schools, including Liberton High School, was carried out in 2012/13 and no concerns with this wall were identified. \\"However, as a precaution, specialist council building services staff will be surveying all similar walls in schools where we know that they exist.\\" A council spokesman added: \\"As a further precaution, a full survey will be carried out on Liberton High School in the coming days before the main school building re-opens to pupils.\\" Gillian Cameron, 46, a parent, said: \\"Someone needs to stand up and be accountable for this. \\"It is not the headmaster's fault, he's trying to run a school with hardly any money. \\"That's what is annoying when you have a child at school, it's the lack of money, we can't afford this, we can't afford that, so they build a tram centre that nobody wants, nobody needs and nobody can afford. \\"It makes you angry. They need to prioritise. A 12-year-old child is not here any more. Did it have to take that, for people to say that school is not safe?\\" The chaplaincy team at the school is holding a vigil following the death. The Church of Scotland's Liberton Northfield church will be open in the afternoon and evening as a safe place for pupils, young people and the local community to go and reflect. They will have the opportunity to sign a book of condolence and light candles. The Rev Cammy Mackenzie, who is a minister at Moredun and Gilmerton and a member of the chaplaincy team serving Liberton and Gilmerton High Schools, said: \\"We recognise the impact this is having on the community and we will be there for anyone who needs us. \\"The church will remain open for as many days as it is required.\\" Meanwhile, Highland Council said it had ordered checks at all 209 of its schools following Keane's death. The council said it was also liaising with High Life Highland to arrange for similar checks in leisure centres.

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The Hellenistic Period ended with the emergence of the Roman Empire, as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt in 30 BC.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Determine the sentiment: The movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level. By presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for Christ. Somehow, according to the plot, god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it's self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds. Yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer. The lead character, an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman, ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer. In other threads of the underdeveloped plot Jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of God. The modern lackluster incarnation of Christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well. He is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it's self. Meanwhile, with little help from Jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty. I also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels. This movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that I could clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs. It raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer. It disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment. Silly","completion":"The sentiment expressed in this passage is predominantly negative. The author expresses strong dissatisfaction with the movie's handling of religious ethics and ideals, as well as its misguided attempt to create a coherent argument against the death penalty. They criticize the film for elevating a murderer to the status of a martyr, and for failing to effectively convey the outrage of God towards the killer's actions. Furthermore, the author is critical of the portrayal of the lead character - a nonreligious, pregnant, suicidal woman - who makes an implausible self-sacrifice without achieving the desired outcome. They also express disappointment in the film's rendition of Jesus, describing him as powerless and frustrated, which serves to dehumanize and mock the messianic idea central to many religions. Additionally, the passage highlights the film's disjointed and underdeveloped plot, where the pregnant woman's ability to reincarnate herself into her newborn child is inexplicably presented as the means of saving mankind. The author also finds that the movie could be interpreted as promoting abortion, which further adds to their dissatisfaction due to the movie's attempt to incorporate religious themes. The overall sentiment of this passage is that the movie fails to effectively address or respect religious beliefs and values, resulting in a confusing and underdeveloped plot that leaves the audience questioning its purpose. The author points out that the movie raises many questions but fails to provide answers, and ultimately mocks the very beliefs it claims to explore. The use of words like \\"asinine,\\" \\"silly,\\" and \\"mock\\" serve to emphasize the strong negative sentiments expressed throughout the passage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Losman were unstoppable in the first quarter, connecting for 205 yards and two 83-yard touchdowns. Evans' first-quarter performance was a Buffalo record for a period and just shy of the NFL record for yards receiving in a quarter of 210 by Baltimore's Qadry Ismail in 1999. The first touchdown came after Nate Clements' interception on the third play of the game. Both were after Evans got in front of Texans cornerback Demarcus Faggins for the easy score. The 83-yard TDs were career highs for both Losman and Evans and marked the first time in franchise history the Bills have had two 80-yard passes in a single game. David Carr opened 1 for 3 with an interception on his first pass before completing his next 22 throws. Carr finished 25 of 30 for 223 yards and no touchdowns. Carr tied the record held by Mark Brunell, who had 22 consecutive completions in Washington's 31-15 win over the Texans at Reliant Stadium on September 24. He tied Brunell's record on a short pass to Wali Lundy for no gain with 6:19 left. The streak was broken when his pass to Andre Johnson with 5:44 remaining fell short. Lundy cut the lead to 14-7 with a 17-yard run in the first quarter. That score was set up by a 17-yard reception by Eric Moulds on third-and-8. Samkon Gado made it 17-14 on a 1-yard run in the second quarter. Moulds also had a key third-down reception on that drive. Dunta Robinson gave the Texans the lead on a 9-yard interception return midway through the third quarter. Losman was throwing out of the end zone when Robinson intercepted the pass intended for Evans to score his first career touchdown and the Texans' first defensive touchdown since 2004. But after the offense failed to put the game away in the fourth quarter the Texans gave the Bills just enough time to beat them. Losman hit a diving Peerless Price in the back of the end zone for the 15-yard touchdown with 13 seconds left, giving Buffalo the 24-21 win. Which players had interceptions?","completion":"In this game, two players had interceptions. The first one is Nate Clements from the Bills. He intercepted a pass early in the game. The second player is Dunta Robinson from the Texans. He not only intercepted a pass intended for Evans but also ran 9 yards to score a touchdown - his very first one in his career! An interception is like stealing the ball when the other team tries to throw it, but instead of catching it, you do. It's a big deal, like taking away someone's candy and getting to eat it yourself.

Q: What are the special mating behaviors in birds called? A: Select from the following. I. display; II. attraction; III. presentation; IV. courtship; The answer is:","completion":"IV. Courtship; Courtship in birds refers to a wide range of special mating behaviors that birds exhibit to attract a potential mate, establish a bond, and ultimately reproduce. These behaviors can be highly elaborate and involve visual, auditory, and physical elements that are unique to each species. More than just a list, the intricate detail behind bird courtship behaviors demonstrates the fascinating world of avian reproduction strategies and social interactions. I. Display: Visual displays are a significant aspect of bird courtship. Birds may use their bright and vivid plumage, specialized feathers, or unique body movements to entice a potential mate. These visual displays can include activities such as puffing up, stretching their wings, or fanning their tail feathers. The primary goal of these displays is to showcase their genetic fitness, health, and overall suitability as a partner. For example, the male peacock displays its iridescent tail feathers in a large fan-like structure and performs a visually stunning dance to attract a female. Similarly, male Birds of Paradise use their brightly colored feathers and sophisticated dance moves to woo a potential mate. II. Attraction: The process of attracting a mate also involves auditory communication such as songs or calls. Birds use vocalizations to establish territory, signal readiness to mate or convey their strength and stamina as a desirable partner. Males of many songbird species, such as nightingales and thrushes, are known for their elaborate and melodious songs during the mating season. These vocal performances help them stand out from other males and increase their chances of attracting a female. III. Presentation: Some bird species engage in a form of presentation (or gift-giving) known as nuptial gifts. These are food items, such as insects or fruits, presented by males to females during courtship rituals. This behavior signifies the male's ability to provide for his potential mate and offspring. For example, male European robins present their female partners with small worms and insects during courtship, while male bowerbirds create ornately decorated nests, or bowers, using sticks, leaves, and brightly colored objects to attract a female's attention. IV. Physical Contact: As part of the courtship process, some birds may engage in physical interactions, such as mutual preening, touching, or mating dances that involve close contact. These tactile behaviors strengthen the pair bond and signify trust between the birds, which is essential for raising offspring together. In conclusion, ​bird courtship behaviors encompass a rich and diverse range of displays, attraction techniques, presentations, and physical interactions that help them secure a suitable partner for reproduction. Through these behaviors, birds showcase their genetic fitness, health, and ability to raise their offspring, ensuring the success and continuation of their species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this situation, Steven had been practicing for weeks in anticipation of the big singing competition. He had invested significant time and effort into his performance, selecting the perfect song, refining his vocal techniques, and even enlisting the help of a voice coach. He was determined to win and prove his talent to the world. On the day of the competition, Steven was filled with a mix of excitement and nerves as he prepared to take the stage. He had watched as various talented contestants showcased their abilities, but he felt confident in his preparation and hard work. As he performed, his voice filled the room, and he connected with the audience, pouring his heart and soul into every note. Withheld a final triumphant note, he knew he had given his best performance. However, once the judges made their decision, Steven was left in disbelief when he didn't win the competition. The feeling of loss and disappointment overwhelmed him, and he could hardly contain his anger and frustration. How could he have invested so much time and energy into his singing, only to be beaten by someone else? Kevin, who happened to also be at the competition as an audience member, decided to approach Steven to offer some words of encouragement. Seeing his friend crushed by disappointment, he'd hoped his words could lift Steven's spirits. However, Steven's anger seemed to have nowhere else to go, and it lashed out at Kevin instead. Steven yelled at Kevin not necessarily because Kevin had done something wrong but because Steven could not come to terms with his loss. He needed an outlet for his intense emotions, and in that moment, Kevin became the target of his anger. Of course, it's crucial to remember that handling loss and disappointment is a learning process, and Steven's reaction in this scenario is merely a reflection of his struggle to accept the result. In conclusion, Steven yelled at Kevin because he was so angry after losing the singing competition. The feeling of defeat and the built-up emotions from weeks of preparation led to this outburst. It is essential for individuals to find healthy ways to process and cope with these emotions. Friends, like Kevin, can be understanding and supportive, allowing an outlet for communication and healing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Audrey Hepburn won an Academy Award as Best Actress for her first major American movie, Roman Holiday, which was showed in 1953. But she is remembered as much for her help as for her acting. Born in Belgium in 1929, Audrey's father was British and her mother was Dutch. Audrey was sent to live at a British school for part of her childhood. During World war II, she lived and studied in the Netherlands. Her mother thought it would be safe from German attacks. Audrey studied dance as a teenager and during college. But when she returned to London after the war she realized she wasn't going to be a ballet dancer. So she began taking acting parts in stage shows. Later she began to get small parts in movies. But it was Audrey Hepburn's move to America that made her truly famous. In 1951 she played the character \\"Gigi\\" in the Broadway play Gigi and won popular praise. Two years later, Roman Holiday made her a star at the age of 24. Audrey made more than 25 movies. Among her most popular roles was \\"Hoolly Golinghtly\\" in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961. Three years later she played \\"Eliza Doolittle\\" in My Fair Lady. She was married twice. In 1989, the UN Children's Fund named Audrey a goodwill ambassador. She travelled all over the world in support of UNICEF projects. The UN agency said she was a tireless worker. She often gave 15 interviews a day to raise money and get support for UNICEF projects. Audrey Hepburn often said her love to UNICEF was the result of her experiences as a child during World War II. She said she knew what it was like to be hungry and to be saved by international help. She was a goodwill ambassador until her death in 1993 from cancer. Question: Why did Audrey live and study in Netherlands? Options: A: She was born there. B: The schools were better there.

Question: Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage? Answer: A:","completion":"Looking after school furniture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Pick out a few ears that are at the ideal stage of ripeness for eating fresh and remove the husks and all traces of remaining silk. While you're shucking, heat a large pot of water until it just begins to boil, then add the corn. At the 3 minute mark, remove the ears from the pot carefully and set them aside on a layer of paper towels to cool. Leave the blanching water to continue boiling. You'll be using it later to pack the corn for canning. Allow the corn to rest until it's cool enough to handle. Then, stand each ear vertically on its end and run a knife down the side to loosen the whole kernels from the cob. Use a large bowl to collect the kernels as they fall, or scrape them into the bowl from your cutting board. Be careful not to let the blade of the knife scrape against the cob. This can release a starchy liquid from the kernels, which may impact the flavor of the canned corn or it's ability to be safely preserved. An electric knife can come in handy for making quick, clean cuts. If one of these tools isn't available, you can use either a smooth or serrated blade, provided it's sharp enough to avoid mangling the kernels. Spoon the kernels into the mouth of each jar, leaving 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space at the top. Give the jar a shake to help the corn settle. Avoid packing or compressing the kernels, as this may damage them. It will take about 2.25 pounds (1,020 g) of whole corn, or about 4 average-sized ears, to fill 1 US-pint (470 ml)-sized canning jar. Double that amount for quart-sized jars. Heat your canning jars under a stream of hot water before adding the corn. This will prevent them from cracking or shattering when you add the boiling canning liquid. The exact temperature isn't that important as long as the jars are still warm to the touch when the corn goes in. Though it's not a strict requirement, a little bit of salt can help preserve canned goods more effectively and for longer periods. For pint jars, a ½ teaspoon pinch will do. For larger quart-sized jars, you can use up to 1 full teaspoon. Use granulated iodized salt or kosher salt only. Pour the hot liquid steadily into each jar until it reaches the top layer of kernels. Avoid overfilling the jars—once again, you'll want to leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of headspace. Let the jars sit open for 3-5 minutes to cool slightly and allow trapped air bubbles to escape. It may help to use a funnel or ladle to safely get the boiling liquid from the pot to the jars. Overfilling may cause the jars to burst when they're subjected to intense pressure. Place the jars in your canner and lock the lid, leaving the heat vent open. Adjust the canner to the appropriate pressure setting specified by the model and start it up. Once the steam stops escaping, close the vent. Pint jars should process for 55 minutes, while quart jars will need about 85. Afterwards, you can cool them off and put them into storage. When preserved by canning, sweet corn will stay good for a year or longer. The exact pressure level you use will depend on the quantity of corn you're canning, as well as your location. As a general rule, however, you'll want to keep it somewhere between 11–13 pounds (5.0–5.9 kg). Alternatively, you can do your canning the old fashioned way by submerging the sealed jars in boiling water until you hear the lids pop.","completion":"The article discusses a method for preserving sweet corn by canning. It suggests selecting ears of corn at the ideal ripeness and removing husks and silk before blanching them for three minutes in boiling water. After cooling and removing the kernels with a knife, approximately 2.25 pounds (1,020 g) of whole corn or 4 average-sized ears can fill one US-pint (470 ml) canning jar, which is doubled for quart-sized jars. Before adding corn to the jars, heat them under hot water to prevent cracking. Optionally, add ½ teaspoon of granulated iodized salt or kosher salt for pint jars, or 1 teaspoon for quart-sized jars to help preserve the corn. Fill the jars with hot liquid, leaving 1 inch (2.5 cm) of headspace and allow them to cool for 3-5 minutes. Place the jars in a canner, lock the lid, and adjust the pressure setting based on the model. Pint jars require 55 minutes of processing time, while quart jars need about 85 minutes.

Then they asked me to have a family trip. On our trip, we turned on the TV at the motel and saw the second plane crash into the World Trade Center. Seeing it falling down, I said to my kids: \\"I'm going to Afghanistan\\". And a few weeks later, international Medical Corps sent me to set up 20 clinics in provinces where people had no health care. In these field clinics surrounded by frightening shoots or deadly bombs, we were eventually serving 27,000 patients a month in a very busy schedule. Tired and nervous, I gradually had a sense of achievement, a sense of purpose, and my depression went away. In the years to follow, I went to Indonesia after the tsunami, Pakistan after the earthquakes, Sudan after the civil warm and Iraq after more and more bombs. Each time after disasters one after another, hundreds of people were killed, wounded and many more had to flee. We once set up movable clinics in an area with 19,000 _ , and it was supposed to hold 13,000 originally. Flu broke out, one of the biggest killers of kids in refugee camps, and it spread like wildfire. Water and food were also serious problems. \\"Adventures or not?\\" I often asked myself.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 5057*p = 5009*p - 384 for p.","completion":"In order to solve this problem, the aim is to isolate p on one side of the equation. This makes it easier to find its value. The given problem is: 5057*p = 5009*p - 384. Now let's proceed to find the solution step-by-step. Step 1: To isolate the terms with p, we can start by subtracting 5009*p from both sides of the equation. The reason for subtracting 5009*p is that it has a positive sign before it. When you subtract it from both sides of the equation, it helps to put all the terms involving p on one side of the equation. This gives: 5057*p - 5009*p = 5009*p - 5009*p - 384. This simplifies to: 48*p = -384. Step 2: The next step is to isolate p on one side of the equation. We can achieve this by dividing both sides of the equation by 48. Divide the left side of the equation by 48 and the right side of the equation by 48 as well: (48*p)/48 = (-384)/48. This simplifies to give the final value of p: p = -8.

We have this problem: 0 = -10*i + 18*i - 32 First, let's combine the terms with \\"i\\" in them: 0 = (-10*i + 18*i) - 32 -10*i and 18*i are like having -10 apples and then getting 18 apples. If we combine them, we have: 0 = 8*i - 32 Our goal is to find the value of \\"i\\". To do that, we need to get \\"i\\" all by itself on one side of the equation. Right now, we have \\"8*i\\", but we want just \\"i\\". So, we need to get rid of the 8. To do that, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8: (0)/8 = (8*i - 32)/8 0 = i - 4 Now we're close! We just need to add 4 to both sides to get \\"i\\" all by itself: 0 + 4 = i - 4 + 4 And so, we have the final answer: i = 4 Yay! We found the treasure – the value of \\"i\\" is 4!

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the following text. Erin was intuitive and compassionate, while Jessica was egotistical and selfish. A). Erin was an awful friend to have.; B). Jessica was an awful friend to have.;","completion":"B). Jessica was an awful friend to have. It was a stark contrast that could be felt by anyone who knew the two friends, Erin and Jessica. On one hand, you had Erin who was blessed with an intuitive and compassionate nature, always highly in tune with the feelings of others and willing to lend a helping hand to a friend in need. On the other hand, there was Jessica, a character known for her egotistical and selfish ways, often preoccupied with herself and her needs above those of the people around her. The friendship between Erin and Jessica was turbulent at best, marred by instances when Jessica would treat Erin and others with little or no regard. Jessica's selfish attitude caused strain in their bond, presenting constant challenges for Erin in maintaining her patient and understanding demeanor. As years went by, the consequences of Jessica's selfish behavior began to mount, leading to a negative impact on Erin's mental and emotional well-being. On countless occasions, Erin went out of her way to help Jessica, whether it was providing emotional support or assisting her with various tasks. Erin's compassionate tendencies were fueled by a deep-rooted desire to help those in need, making her a valuable friend to others. Conversely, Jessica seldom reciprocated this kindness. She was the type who expected everything to revolve around her and frequently acted on her own self-interests. This made Jessica an awful friend to have, as she rarely placed any value on the feelings or needs of others. Despite her unpleasant qualities, Jessica managed to maintain friendships by manipulating people and exploiting their vulnerability, and Erin was no exception. By preying on Erin's compassionate nature, Jessica managed to keep their friendship alive, albeit a rather one-sided one. However, as time wore on, the detrimental effects of Jessica's behavior became more and more evident to others within their social circle. Being an awful friend was not only about what Jessica did, but also what she didn't do. A critical aspect of any healthy friendship is the ability to recognize the needs of others and respond appropriately. Unfortunately, Jessica lacked the empathy required to put someone else's feelings before her own. She would ignore Erin's pleas for support and repeatedly dismiss her concerns as unimportant, which only served to fuel the dysfunction within their friendship. In contrast to Jessica, Erin's steadfast devotion to her friends positioned her as a person that others aspired to be around. She was the one who would gladly lend an ear and offer a shoulder to cry on, enacting the role of a true companion. Faced with challenges within her own life, Erin had the resilience and insight to recognize the inherent value of maintaining healthy relationships and understanding what it takes to be a good friend. Ultimately, the stark comparison between Erin and Jessica – the former having an intuitive and compassionate demeanor, the latter being overly egotistical and selfish – undeniably demonstrated that Jessica was an awful friend to have. Erin's moral compass and unwavering commitment to her friends made her the superior choice as a friend for those who valued emotional support, understanding, and genuine human connection. In the end, it was Jessica's own character flaws that defined her as an undesirable friend, one who, at her core, thrived on exploitation and manipulation, severely lacking the empathy and selflessness that are essential ingredients of any lasting and meaningful friendship."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption PM: Trump speculation 'not helpful' Prime Minister Theresa May has rebuked US President Donald Trump for suggesting suspects in Friday's London train blast were known to police. \\"I never think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,\\" she said. In a tweet, Mr Trump described the attackers as \\"loser terrorists\\" and \\"sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard\\". The bomb rocked a London Underground train, injuring 29 people. In a phone call with Mrs May on Friday, Mr Trump \\"pledged to continue close collaboration with the United Kingdom to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism\\", the White House said. A Downing Street spokesman said he also offered \\"his condolences over this morning's cowardly attack in London\\", which he described to reporters earlier as \\"a terrible thing\\". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Trump says 'we've got to be much tougher' The call followed Mrs May's critical remarks about the US president. In one of his tweets, Mr Trump appeared to chide UK authorities: \\"Must be proactive!\\" London police said of his comments, \\"any speculation is unhelpful\\". Nick Timothy, a former senior aide to British Prime Minister Theresa May, echoed London police's comments. \\"True or not - and I'm sure he doesn't know - this is so unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner,\\" he tweeted. Former Conservative MP Ben Howlett also weighed in, calling Mr Trump's tweets \\"dangerous and inappropriate\\". In other tweets on Friday, the Republican president claimed his administration had \\"made more progress in the last nine months\\" against the Islamic State group than his predecessor, Barack Obama. \\"Must be proactive & nasty!\\" he tweeted. Analysis: Changing the subject? Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Washington Last month Donald Trump defended his delay in ascribing blame for the violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville by saying: \\"I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement.\\" That is advice the president seemed uninterested in heeding on Friday morning, as he fired off a series of tweets reacting to the London train incident. In fact, with few exceptions, Mr Trump is happy to quickly react to international incidents he suspects are perpetrated by Islamic militants, even when - in the case of the Philippines casino robbery - that's not the case. Besides his London remarks on Friday morning, the president again blasted Senate procedural rules, called for his Muslim travel ban to be \\"tougher\\", said the fight against the so-called Islamic State should be \\"nasty\\", and slammed ESPN, a US sports cable network, for being too political. Given that Mr Trump was under fire from his base on Thursday for reaching out to Democrats and being too conciliatory on immigration, it is hard not to think that his actions on Friday may be an effort to change the subject. Mr Trump also renewed a call to shut down internet capabilities, which he said were a main recruitment tool for terrorists. During the Republican presidential campaign in 2015, Mr Trump suggested he would ask Microsoft founder Bill Gates to cut off the internet because of terror recruitment. \\"We're losing a lot of people because of the internet,\\" Mr Trump said at the time, without elaborating. \\"We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening.\\" \\"We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some ways,\\" he added. Friday was not the first time Mr Trump has been accused of reacting to suspected terrorist incidents before the facts are fully known. If he did leak sensitive information in his tweet about Scotland Yard, rather than indulging in pure speculation as London police say, it could amount to a security breach. In May, US officials angered British authorities when details about a deadly bomb attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester were divulged to US media. The New York Times was criticised for publishing photographs from the scene, as well as images of the bomb. The president also used Friday's tweets to promote his travel ban temporarily barring people from six Muslim-majority countries as well Syrian refugees from entering the US. ||||| PM says US president’s speculation that Parsons Green attack perpetrators were known to Metropolitan police is unhelpful Theresa May has rebuked Donald Trump for suggesting the people responsible for an explosion on a London tube train were known to the Metropolitan police. The prime minister expressed her frustration as she spoke for the first time about the “cowardly attack�? at Parsons Green underground station in west London, which injured 29 people. Parsons Green explosion caused by IED that only partly blew up, police suspect – latest Read more Trump claimed on Twitter that the terrorist attack involved “sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard�?, despite no such information having been released publicly by police. He also blamed it on “loser terrorists�?, promoted his travel ban and advocated a “proactive and nasty�? policy against Islamic State. Asked about Trump’s potential breach of convention on intelligence sharing, May was unusually critical of the US president, saying: “I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.�? When the president tweeted, no suspect had been identified and no group or individual had claimed responsibility for the blast. The Met police said the president’s comments regarding Friday morning’s incident were unhelpful and “pure speculation�?. There was no immediate response from the White House to questions about the basis of Trump’s assertion. Speaking outside the White House on Friday, Trump made no reference to her rebuke. “It’s a terrible thing,�? he said. “It just keeps going and going, and we have to be very smart, we have to be very, very tough. Perhaps we are not nearly tough enough. “It’s just an absolutely terrible thing. In fact, I’m going to call the prime minister right now. We have to be tougher and we have to be smarter.�? Downing Street said Trump offered May his condolences over the attack during a telephone call later on Friday. In a summary of the call, a White House statement said: “President Trump spoke with Prime Minister Theresa May to convey his sympathies and prayers for those injured in the terrorist attack today in London. The President pledged to continue close collaboration with the United Kingdom to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism.�? Play Video 0:27 Trump makes no reference to May's rebuke when asked about London train explosion In the aftermath of the Manchester Arena bombing in May, British police temporarily suspended intelligence sharing with the US, after a series of leaks to US media. The broadcaster CBS disclosed the name of the bomber, Salman Abedi, citing US sources, at a time when British authorities were asking the media to withhold the information to protect the investigation. The New York Times then published detailed photographs of the bomb scene that had been taken by British investigators. Nick Timothy, a newspaper columnist who was formerly May’s chief of staff, wrote on Twitter of Trump’s remarks: “True or not – and I’m sure he doesn’t know – this is so unhelpful from the leader of our ally and intelligence partner.�? Eighteen people were taken to hospital after the explosion, which was being treated as an isolated incident, and four people made their own way to hospital. London ambulance service said: “None are thought to be in a serious or life-threatening condition.�? Trump’s intervention had echoes of his tweets after the London Bridge attack in June, when he criticised Sadiq Khan’s call for calm. In a statement, the London mayor confirmed that the Parsons Green explosion was being treated as terrorism and said: “I urge all Londoners to be calm and vigilant.�? At a morning press briefing, the Met assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said: “We now assess that this was a detonation of an improvised explosive device. As you will have seen, there are reports of 18 injuries. I understand most of those to be flash burns.�? Rowley said the investigation was being led by the Met counter-terrorism command, supported by MI5. Police officers would be deployed across the capital’s transport network, he added. At around the time Rowley spoke, Trump sent consecutive tweets: Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better! Trump revives criticism of 'both sides' in Charlottesville Read more He then sent a third: “The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific – but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!�? Trump’s travel ban against refugees and others from six majority-Muslim countries is in force but not in full effect, as court challenges on constitutional grounds continue. A first version, against seven countries, was withdrawn after similar challenges. “We have made more progress in the last nine months against Isis than the Obama Administration has made in 8 years,�? he said. “Must be proactive & nasty!�? The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, will be able to ask Trump to be more cautious with his comments in future when he sees him on Monday at a special UN general assembly session on reforming the organisation. May and Johnson have repeatedly urged politicians and the media not to speculate about the identity of a terrorist, or whether any suspects were under surveillance by UK security services. Overall, the Foreign Office has become more relaxed about Trump’s plain speaking, but the security services that work under its political direction will be infuriated by any sign that the US president has leaked intelligence information. Trust and confidentiality between UK and US intelligence is the bedrock of the relationship between the two services. May is is due to make prevention of extremism on the internet one of her three key themes at the UN next week. Although May does not support Trump’s talk of cutting off the internet, she agrees with him that technology giants have not done enough to tackle online extremism. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, has told off US President Donald Trump for suggesting that the people responsible for the recent explosion on a London train were known to the police.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that George Grove helped? ? In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the... Answer:","completion":"The name of the person that George Grove helped is Camille Saint-Saëns.

Babies who watched 60 minutes of TV daily had developmental scores a third lower at 14 months than babies who were watching less TV. Although their developmental scores were still in the normal range, the difference may have been due to the fact that when children and parents are watching TV, they are missing the talking, playing and other communications that are important to learning and development. This new study, which appeared in the Aechives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, followed 259 lower-income families in New York, most of whom spoke Spanish as their primary language at home. Other studies of higher-income families have also come to the same conclusion: TV watching is not only non-educational, but it seems to slow down babies' development. But what about \\"good\\" TV, like Sesame Street? The researchers didn't find any difference when compared to non-educational programs designed for small children, like Spongebob SquarePants. Earlier research by some of the same scientists, most of whom are at New York University School of Medicine's Bellevue Hospital Centre, has found that parents whose children watch non-educational TV programs like Spongebob SquarePants spend less time reading to their children or teaching them. At this point, parents reading this will probably be astonished. TV is so often a parent's good friend, keeping children happily occupied so that the adults can cook dinner, answer the phone, or take a shower. But, clearly, this electronic babysitter is not an educational aid. It is best to make sure the babies are fast asleep if you have to watch TV. Question: We can infer from the passage that _ .

The traditional parish system persisted until the Reconstruction Era, when counties were imposed.[citation needed] Nevertheless, traditional parishes still exist in various capacities, mainly as public service districts. When the city of Charleston was formed, it was defined by the limits of the Parish of St. Philip and St. Michael, now also includes parts of St. James' Parish, St. George's Parish, St. Andrew's Parish, and St. John's Parish, although the last two are mostly still incorporated rural parishes. Counties replaced what system in South Carolina?","completion":"The system that was replaced by counties in South Carolina was the traditional parish system. The traditional parish system was a form of local government based on ecclesiastical parishes, often focused on a local church, and it persisted until the Reconstruction Era. During this Era, a wave of social, economic, and political changes happened in the United States, particularly in the South, following the Civil War and the abolition of slavery. One of these changes was the imposition of the county system as a new political and administrative division, in which a county became a geographic region within a state, usually having some governmental authority. However, even after the introduction of counties, the parishes did not completely disappear. They continued to exist in various capacities, primarily to function as public service districts. For instance, the city of Charleston was defined by the limits of the Parish of St. Philip and St. Michael and later expanded to include parts of St. James' Parish, St. George's Parish, St. Andrew's Parish, and St. John's Parish. It is noteworthy that the last two, St. Andrew's Parish and St. John's Parish, are mainly still incorporated rural parishes, indicating the continued relevance and influence of the parish system in certain areas. Thus, the shift from the parish system to the county system in South Carolina represents a significant transformation in the local administration and governance during the Reconstruction Era. It also reflects the broader historical, social, and cultural changes that were taking place throughout the United States during this period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) has been reported to be involved in the development of several human cancers. The present study was conducted to investigate the expression of GOLPH3 and its prognostic significance in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Meanwhile, the function of GOLPH3 in human RCC was further investigated in cell culture models.', 'Expression of GOLPH3 was examined in 43 fresh RCC tissues and paired adjacent normal renal tissues by real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting. Immunohistochemistry for GOLPH3 was performed on additional 218 RCC tissues. The clinical significance of GOLPH3 expression was analysed. Downregulation of GOLPH3 was performed using small-interfering RNA (siRNA) in Caki-1 and 786-O cells with high abundance of GOLPH3, and the effects of GOLPH3 silencing on cell proliferation, migration, invasion in vitro, and tumour growth in vivo were evaluated.', \\"Expression of GOLPH3 was upregulated in the majority of the RCC clinical tissue specimens at both mRNA and protein levels. Clinicopathological analysis showed that GOLPH3 expression was significantly correlated with T stage (P<0.001), lymph-node status (P=0.003), distant metastasis (P<0.001), tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (P<0.001), and Fuhman grade (P=0.001). Expression of GOLPH3 was inversely correlated with both overall and recurrence-free survival of RCC patients. Multivariate analysis showed that GOLPH3 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for patient's survival. Knockdown of the GOLPH3 expression reduced cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration, invasion, and tumour growth in xenograft model mice.

Powell contended that it was not inconsistent to want to foster cooperation even with an organization like the Indonesian military, which has a history of human rights abuses. \\"If you get young officers, expose them to a military organization that is within a democratic political institution, such as the United States, then that rubs off on them,\\" he said. In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities. His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized. The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial. Powell said his discussions with Mahathir \\"touched on the case\\" of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is serving a 15-year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials that Powell said the United States had \\"always felt\\" were flawed.

Not for him the hypocritical lies of a genius sailor on a divine mission to win souls for Christ. He is determined to upturn the entire conservative myth of Western Civilization's arrival in the Americas as a force for good. Rather, his story is about what Columbus set in motion; the obsession with gold, the hunt for slaves by Spanish mastiffs, and punitive violence to those Indians who fought back. His story is counterbalanced by the radical priests Bartolome de las Casas (Raul Arevalo) and Antonio Montestinos (Carlos Santos) who were the first to raise their voice in defence of the Indians, and ask the question, Are these men? Sebastian is also obsessed by the first Indian leader to resist - Hatuey (Carlos Aduviri), who was nailed to a cross and crucified as example to those who oppose the Christians. The talented and brilliant actor playing Columbus constantly challenges Sebastian and accuses him of agit prop and cheap manipulation. Costa doesn't give a shit. He cares little about what happened yesterday, never mind 500 years ago. The only thing that matters to him is his professional pride as a producer - that the film is made on time and within budget.

Understanding these concepts helps in selecting the appropriate lighting solution for various applications. Color Rendering Index (CRI) is a measurement used to determine how accurately a light source reveals the colors of objects in comparison to natural light. The CRI scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better color rendering abilities. A CRI of 80 or above is typically considered to be good, as it means that a significant number of colors will appear natural and vibrant under the light source. CRI > 80 is ideal for most applications, including residential and commercial settings, where accurate color perception and visual comfort are essential. Color temperature, measured in Kelvin (K), describes the appearance of light emitted by a source and how it affects the warmth or coolness of a space. A lower color temperature, typically below 3000K, produces a warm, amber-hued light that creates a cozy ambiance. In contrast, a higher color temperature, ranging from 4000K to 6000K, emits a cooler, bluish-white light that promotes alertness and clarity. A 4000K color temperature strikes a balance between warm and cool, making it suitable for various environments such as offices, retail spaces, and general indoor lighting. When considering lighting options, it is essential to evaluate both the color rendering index (CRI > 80) and color temperature (4000K) to achieve optimal lighting conditions that enhance visual comfort, promote productivity, and ensure accurate color representation for various applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Another early example is the nave and apse area of the Cathedral of Cefalù in 1131.

In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX may feel what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, the feeling is an emotional reaction on the part of X or other participants in an event. For example, as a result of gift-giving, X might feel good about [one]self.

Usage: Head: \\"PersonX graduates with a degree\\" and Tail: \\"hopeful\\". In this part, we identify the two phrases. In the Head phrase, we see an event where PersonX has graduated with a degree. In the Tail phrase, we need to determine if the emotional reaction of \\"hopeful\\" is a possible outcome. Part #2: Identifying possible emotional reactions. Usage: In the Head phrase, \\"PersonX graduates with a degree,\\" the possible emotional reactions could be happiness, pride, relief, excitement, etc. In this part, we analyze potential feelings that PersonX might have as a result of the Head phrase event. Part #3: Comparing the emotional reaction in the tail to possible emotional reactions. Usage: In the Tail phrase, we check whether \\"hopeful\\" aligns with potential emotional reactions from the Head phrase, such as happiness and excitement. In this case, graduating with a degree could indeed inspire hope and optimism for the future. Part #4: Determine the classification answer. Usage: Since \\"hopeful\\" is a possible emotional reaction to PersonX graduating with a degree, we classify the answer as \\"Yes\\".

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Yes, both questions ultimately inquire about the same topic, which is the best films that center around prison break scenarios. \\"Prison Break-type movies\\" tend to focus on elaborate and often thrilling escape plans from high-security prisons. They can contain action, suspense, and sometimes even psychological elements, unraveling the human will to grasp freedom regardless of the circumstances. Popular prison break-style movies include: 1. \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" (1994): This film is considered a classic in the prison escape genre. It was based on Stephen King's novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\". Tim Robbins plays the role of Andy Dufresne, a banker sentenced to two consecutive life terms for a crime he claims he did not commit. His intellect and composed character take him through the roller-coaster ride of prison life, all the while plotting a meticulous escape. 2. \\"Escape from Alcatraz\\" (1979): This film tells the true story of three inmates who escaped from the maximum security prison of Alcatraz Island. Clint Eastwood plays the role of Frank Morris, a tough, intelligent character who spearheads the daring escape. 3. \\"The Great Escape\\" (1963): This iconic film is based on a true story from World War II. A group of American soldiers in a German POW camp create an elaborate plan to dig a tunnel and escape from their confinement. 4. \\"Papillon\\" (1973): The protagonist, played by Steve McQueen, is a falsely convicted man sent to a French penal colony in Guiana. He forms an alliance with a counterfeiter, played by Dustin Hoffman, in an attempt to escape the brutal conditions. The film has high drama with a gritty portrayal of prison life and several escape attempts. 5. \\"A Man Escaped\\" (1956): This French film tells the real-life escape story of André Devigny from the Montluc prison during World War II. 6. \\"Midnight Express\\" (1978): This is based on the true story of Billy Hayes, an American college student who gets caught smuggling drugs out of Turkey and is sentenced to more than 30 years in prison. The film mostly revolves around his multiple attempts to escape. 7. \\"Stalag 17\\" (1953): Set in a German POW camp during WWII, the story follows a group of American airmen who suspect that one among them is an informant. All the while, they plan an elaborate escape. 8. \\"Escape Plan\\" (2013): This modern film features Sylvester Stallone as a structural engineer who is wrongfully incarcerated in the maximum-security prison he designed. He then plans an elaborate escape. Another variation of the question would be \\"Which are the top-rated movies involving prison escapes?\\" or \\"What are some highly recommended movies about prison breakouts?\\" which again share the same sentiment inquiring about notable films in the escape genre."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we need to add and subtract all the numbers before the equals sign: -2121 - 3059 - 4014 + 3029 1. To subtract 3059 from -2121, you can think of it as adding 2121 to 3059 and putting a minus sign in front of the answer. So, 2121 + 3059 = 5180, and then put the minus sign back: -5180. 2. Now, you have -5180 - 4014. To subtract 4014 from -5180, you can think of it as adding 4014 to 5180. So, 5180 + 4014 = 9194, and then put the minus sign back: -9194. 3. Lastly, you have -9194 + 3029. To add 3029 to -9194, you can think of it as taking away 3029 from 9194. So, 9194 - 3029 = 6165, and then put the minus sign back: -6165. Now the equation looks like this: -6165 = 137 * r We want to find out what number (r) we need to multiply 137 by to get -6165. 4. To do that, we divide -6165 by 137: -6165 ÷ 137 = -45 So, the answer is: r = -45"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When I was in middle school, if you didn’t have homework completed or goofed off in some way, teachers could make you stay after school for ‘after school help.’ It was essentially a mandatory study hall and if a teacher called you out, you had no choice in the matter. Now, I was in Biology class towards end of my middle school career and was sitting at one of those lab tables next to another student. We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people’s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn’t quite finish. Our teacher is working his way around the classroom checking assignments. So, he checks my lab partner, “well Scott, looks like you will be staying after school today.” This fellow student knew I didn’t have mine either, but also knew I was a pretty good student. I feel like I am sweating bullets and trembling as the teacher approaches me. In a near panic, I reach into my folder and pull out a prior week’s assignment. He looks it over and says “OK, good job” or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief. Even funnier was the fact that this week’s assignment required 6–7 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page. It was totally obvious what I had done, but our teacher gave me a break that day. I managed to make it thru all three years without needing any ‘after school help!’ This was a large public school and they still paddled students if the infraction was serious enough.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: All babies are different, and not all like to go to sleep the same way, but most like to be gently rocked. Try holding the baby in your arms and slowly swinging the baby back and forth, or holding the baby securely while walking around with a bouncy step, or rocking in a rocking chair. If the baby won't go to sleep, gently lift the baby up and lay the baby in its crib. Never leave a baby in its crib on its back with its bottle in its hands because the baby could choke. After the baby is asleep, sit in the baby's room with it and wait to make sure the baby will stay asleep, and that the baby's sleep environment is safe -- Make sure there is nothing that the baby could play within the crib. It could distract the baby and it won't want to go to sleep. Also, soft toys should never be in a crib, because a baby could suffocate. Keep big, fluffy blankets or pillows out of the crib. Babies don't really need them and they are actually dangerous. Keep bed covers away from baby's face. Do not lie a baby on its tummy, ever, even if the parent tells you too. Always place it on its back. Placing it on its tummy is very dangerous, and potentially fatal. (If the baby is old enough to flip itself over on its tummy by itself, though, it's okay if he flips himself over). Keep checking on the baby as it sleeps. This is very important as it is your babysitting duty to make sure that the baby is safe, is not fussing, is not too hot or cold and does not have a dirty diaper. Baby monitoring is fine if the parents are fine with it, if they don't have a baby monitor, or grant you permission to use them, check on them every 15 minutes.","completion":"In summary, putting a baby to sleep requires understanding that each baby is unique, and using safe techniques to help them fall asleep. Gently rocking the baby in your arms, walking with a bouncy step, or using a rocking chair can be useful methods. If the baby won't sleep, place them in their crib gently. It is critical not to leave the baby unattended with a bottle, as this poses a choking hazard. Make sure the sleep environment is secure by removing potential distractions or dangerous objects, such as soft toys, large blankets, and pillows. Keep bed covers away from the baby's face to prevent suffocation. Always lie the baby on its back for sleeping, as placing them on their tummy is extremely hazardous. However, if the baby is old enough to flip over by itself, it's acceptable for them to do so. As part of your babysitting duties, continuously monitor the baby to ensure their safety and well-being. If the parents are comfortable with using a baby monitor, do so; otherwise, check on the baby every 15 minutes. Always prioritize the baby's safety, keeping them comfortable, and maintaining a clean and appropriate sleeping environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Abstract Several studies have documented fish populations changing in response to long-term warming. Over the last decade, sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine increased faster than 99% of the global ocean. The warming, which was related to a northward shift in the Gulf Stream and to changes in the Atlantic Multidecadal and Pacific Decadal Oscillations, led to reduced recruitment and increased mortality in the region’s Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock. Failure to recognize the impact of warming on cod contributed to overfishing. Recovery of this fishery depends on sound management, but the size of the stock depends on future temperature conditions. The experience in the Gulf of Maine highlights the need to incorporate environmental factors into resource management. ||||| OSLO A rapid warming of the Gulf of Maine off the eastern United States has made the water too hot for cod, pushing stocks toward collapse despite deep reductions in the number of fish caught, a U.S. study showed on Thursday. The Gulf of Maine had warmed faster than 99 percent of the rest of the world's oceans in the past decade, influenced by shifts in the Atlantic Gulf Stream, changes in the Pacific Ocean and a wider trend of climate change, it said. Scientists said the findings showed a need to take more account of changing water temperatures in managing global fish stocks usually based on historical data of catches. Traditional calculations \\"consistently over-estimated the abundance of cod,\\" said Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer of the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and lead author of the study in the journal Science. \\"Rapid changes outpaced our ability to recognize and react to what was happening in the water,\\" he told an online news conference. Fisheries managers cut cod quotas in recent years but cod numbers kept falling because the rapidly warming waters were making the Gulf of Maine inhospitable for the fish. From 2004, temperatures rose by more than 0.23 degree Celsius (0.4 Fahrenheit) a year, culminating in an ocean heat wave in the northwest Atlantic in 2012-13. And commercial cod landings fell to 1,000 tonnes in the Gulf of Maine in 2013, sliding from a recent high of 6,000 in 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. A U.N. climate report last year said that global warming was pushing many fish stocks toward the poles. Cod are thriving in cooler waters such as off Canada, Norway or Greenland. \\"The Gulf of Maine cod is a wake-up call\\" for better coordination between climate scientists and fisheries management, said Katherine Mills, one of the authors at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. She said it was unlikely that cod catches would recover to pre-crisis levels. The experts laid out scenarios that foresaw a recovery to 5,000 tonnes a year by 2030 in a warm scenario or to just 1,800 tonnes in a hot scenario.

They're In Hot Water Enlarge this image toggle caption Gulf of Maine Research Institute Gulf of Maine Research Institute Cod was once so plentiful in New England that legend had it you could walk across the local waters by stepping on the backs of the fish. Now, though, this tasty species is in such trouble there that cod fishing is practically shut down. And scientists say it looks like rapid warming in the Gulf of Maine explains why regulators' recent efforts to help the cod while allowing fishing were a failure. \\"Year after year, as they looked at the population, they realized that there were fewer cod than they expected there to be,\\" says Andrew Pershing, an oceanographer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. \\"They thought that they should be rebuilding, but they were actually declining.\\" At the same time the cod were mysteriously failing to rebound, he says, strange things were happening on the shores of Maine. People were finding seahorses, which almost never go that far north. \\"We had squid we don't normally find here,\\" recalls Pershing, \\"we had species like black sea bass that are normally found around Long Island that were hanging out in the lobster traps here in Maine.\\" These oddities were happening because the Gulf of Maine was warming. In the journal Science, Pershing and his colleagues say the warming was also hurting the cod — and managers didn't take it into account when setting their fishing quotas. That means even if people didn't exceed their quotas, too much cod got taken. \\"In really warm years, every female cod produces fewer babies than we would expect, and we also see that the young fish are less likely to survive and become adults,\\" says Pershing. Ecosystems all around the world are warming up due to global climate change, says Pershing, but the Gulf of Maine is ahead of the curve. Over the past decade, it's warmed faster than 99.9 percent of the global ocean. \\"That happened so fast that the people that were managing this very important fishery were not able to keep up with the changes,\\" he says. Enlarge this image toggle caption Gulf of Maine Research Institute Gulf of Maine Research Institute While fishery managers tend to make decisions based on past experience, he thinks that won't cut it when the environment is changing in truly unusual ways. Patrick Sullivan, a fishery management expert at Cornell University, says it's tough to say what lessons managers should take from this experience with cod. \\"The challenge, of course, is should we have known this, would we have known this? And in that sense it's challenging to say that we actually should have done something different here,\\" notes Sullivan. He says it's no easy job to predict how an environment will change — or how the fish will react. Still, he was pleased that the researchers who did this study say it looks like cod will be able to persist in the Gulf of Maine, despite the warming trend. \\"I was actually encouraged that, through appropriate management, if we take into account the environmental change, that these stocks can be rebuilt within a reasonable amount of time,\\" says Sullivan. But Pershing says rebuilding will look different in 2020 than it would in 1990. \\"Even with the lowest warming that we could find out of any of the climate model runs, we still end up with a population that's only about a half of what the population should have had in the 1990s,\\" says Pershing. \\"We're headed for a Gulf of Maine where there still should be cod, but where there will be fewer cod than there used to be. They will be a much smaller part of this ecosystem than they were 20 years ago.\\" ||||| The cod fishing industry in the Gulf of Maine is all but gone despite adherence to harvesting restrictions. A cod that will be auctioned off is held by Codie Small at the Portland Fish Exchange, Thursday, in Portland, Maine. Portland's Gulf of Maine Research Institute is announcing a major breakthrough in climate and fisheries science. A study published in the journal Science indicates cod, which have collapsed off of New England, are declining because of warming oceans. It’s a bad time to be a fish and chips lover in New England. Rapidly warming water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine are wreaking havoc on the cod population and fishing industries, according to a report published in Science magazine. Maine's gulf, a key fishing area that stretches from Cape Cod to Canada and touches Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire, is warming too quickly for the cod in the area. The gulf has warmed faster than 99 percent of the world’s oceans, the researchers found. Fishing managers say the area is at about 3 percent of sustainable levels and the fisheries could face even more drastic cuts to help replenish the population. Harvesting restrictions have been in place for quite some time, but because quota plans did not take warming waters into account, they have failed to adequately preserve the population, as The Christian Science Monitor reported earlier this week. \\"Rapid changes outpaced our ability to recognize and react to what was happening in the water,\\" Andrew Pershing, the lead author of the study, told an online news conference. \\"Every animal has a temperature range that they prefer. The Gulf of Maine, for cod, is really at the warm end of that,\\" Pershing told The Associated Press. \\"If you warm it, you push it somewhere that's really uncomfortable.\\" The decline in cod populations has devastated the commercial Atlantic cod industry in New England as well as Georges Bank. In 2001, 33 million pounds of cod were caught in those areas. In 2013, less than 5 million pounds was brought ashore. The shortage has driven the price of local cod sky high in New England and many restaurants are importing from Iceland and Norway. Other restaurants are using different kinds of fish completely. Cod are still thriving off Canada, Greenland, and many of the Nordic countries, which is in keeping with projections that global warming might be pushing many fish species to the poles, where the water is colder. \\"The Gulf of Maine cod is a wake-up call,\\" Katherine Mills, one of the authors of the Science report, told Reuters. Ms. Mills said it was unlikely that the Gulf of Maine region would ever recover to pre-crisis levels for cod. Experts have laid out a recovery plan for the species that is slowed by warming waters. This report includes material from The Associated Press and Reuters. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A recent study published in the journal Science shows that rapid warming in the Gulf of Maine has led to a decline in the region's cod stock.

Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training? Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, it is not possible to definitively state which group didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training. However, it can be inferred that both groups experienced some level of cardiovascular improvement due to engaging in physical activity for three months. The Blue group participated in weight training for three months. Weight training is a form of resistance exercise, which can lead to improvements in cardiovascular health as it requires the heart to pump more blood to supply the working muscles. Over time, this increased demand leads the heart to become more efficient at pumping blood. Additionally, weight training can lead to enhanced muscular strength and endurance, which may also contribute to overall cardiovascular fitness. On the other hand, the Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. Running is an aerobic exercise that primarily focuses on improving cardiovascular fitness. Aerobic exercises like running require the heart to pump more blood in order to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the muscles. Over time, this increased demand can result in a stronger heart, an increase in the heart's stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped with each heartbeat), and overall improved cardiovascular efficiency. In conclusion, it cannot be definitively stated that one group didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training. Both groups underwent different forms of exercise that led to improvements in cardiovascular fitness. However, based on the nature of aerobic exercises like running, it is likely that the Brown group experienced more significant increases in cardiovascular fitness compared to the Blue group, as running places a more consistent and direct focus on aerobic conditioning. Nevertheless, both forms of training positively contributed to the cardiovascular adaptations experienced by each group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Based on the premise \\"Italy has 21 percent of the U.S. population and 16 percent (approximately one seventh) of the U.S. per capita volume.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Italy has 50% of the US population.\\" is true?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Italy has 50% of the US population\\" is true based on the given premise. The statement provided clearly mentions that Italy has 21 percent of the U.S. population, which means that Italy's population is 21% of the US population, not 50%. In order to examine this further, let's break down the given information and compare the two countries. The given premise states that: 1. Italy has 21 percent of the U.S. population. 2. Italy has 16 percent (approximately one-seventh) of the U.S. per capita volume. Before proceeding, let's clarify what is meant by \\"per capita volume.\\" The term often refers to the economic metric \\"Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita,\\" which measures the economic output of a country per person. It is an average value obtained by dividing a country's total GDP by its population. In this case, the premise states that Italy's GDP per capita is about one-seventh that of the United States. Now, let's address the hypothesis in question: \\"Italy has 50% of the US population.\\" As mentioned earlier, the premise clearly indicates that Italy's population constitutes 21% of the US population. If Italy had 50% of the US population, it would imply that the population of Italy is half that of the United States. However, this statement contradicts the given premise, which informs us that Italy's population is only 21% of the US population. Furthermore, the portion of the premise addressing the per capita volume (one-seventh of the U.S. per capita volume) does not have any bearing on the population comparison between Italy and the United States. It only serves as a comparison of economic output per person for the two countries. In conclusion, based on the given premise, we cannot determine that the hypothesis \\"Italy has 50% of the US population\\" is true. In fact, the provided information directly contradicts this hypothesis, since it states that Italy has 21% of the US population. The economic comparison (per capita volume) does not affect this population comparison, so it cannot be used as evidence to support the hypothesis either."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How did the facebook exec try to justify the Ugly memo? Options: - Connecting people is de facto good - not enough information - It would improve health care - It was in response to the FCC settlement A:","completion":"The Facebook exec tried to justify the Ugly Memo by claiming that connecting people is de facto good, emphasizing that they believe in connecting people so deeply that anything allowing them to connect more people more often is inherently good, even if it has negative consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many ryokans sprang up in the 17th century to put up feudal lords traveling along the Tokaido highway to Edo(now Tokyo). Today tourists looking for a taste of the country's historic lifestyle find varying levels of understated elegance in ryokans throughout the country. A typical stay starts with a greeting from the inn's staff and a change from street shoes into slippers .An attendant leads guests to their rooms, where slippers are removed before walking on the rice-straw flooring, called tatami. Walking slowly along behind a kimonoclad attendant on the creaky wood floors of Fukuzumiro ryokan,s hallways is like stepping back in time. The inn was established in 1890 by a former samurai . Tim Paterson ,33, a banker living in Tokyo, has stayed at several ryokans. This New Zealand native leaves after a recent stay at Fukuzumiro. \\"I think it's quite good mixing culture with history and not just going to see it ,but living in it, staying in it,\\"he said. Sliding glass doors line the inn's rural hallways, bringing in the sound of tricking water and the quietness of the stone and tree-filled courtyards outside.

Neil, on the other hand, is like another mommy bird with different baby birds. Each mommy bird knows how to take care of their own baby birds the best. Now, Leslie's baby birds try to learn new things and sometimes it's difficult for them. So when they need help, they look to Leslie, their mommy bird. Leslie really wants her baby birds to learn and grow, so she tries her best to be supportive and help them. But sometimes, it's not as easy as it looks. Some of Leslie's baby birds need more help than others and may have a harder time learning something new. Since Leslie is a caring mommy bird, she spends more time and energy helping those baby birds who need her support the most. Neil, the other mommy bird, has baby birds too. His baby birds try to learn and grow as well, and sometimes they also need help just like Leslie's baby birds. But since every baby bird is different, Neil's baby birds might need support in different ways than Leslie's baby birds do. So, when Leslie tries to help Neil's baby birds, it's like a mommy bird trying to help baby birds that aren't her own. She may not know exactly what they need and how best to support them.

In order to ensure that things go smoothly, they engage in foreplay. What might they start by doing? Options: A. kiss B. lubricate C. sleep D. procreation E. sexual release Answer:","completion":"Option A, James and Judy might start by kissing. Foreplay is an essential part of a healthy and pleasurable sexual experience for many people. It helps in creating emotional and physical intimacy, as well as preparing the body for sexual intercourse. Kissing is a common and effective form of foreplay, as it fosters a sense of connection and affection between partners while helping to build arousal. Kissing, specifically, is a way for James and Judy to express their love and attraction towards each other. It can vary from gentle and sweet to passionate and intense, serving as a way to communicate nonverbally and explore each other's desires and boundaries. Kissing is also a natural way to increase the release of oxytocin, the hormone responsible for feelings of bonding and closeness. Asides from kissing, there are several other forms of foreplay that James and Judy could engage in, such as touching and caressing, fondling, and oral stimulation. These activities not only create a sense of intimacy between partners but also play a crucial role in increasing arousal and preparing the body for sexual activity. Option B, lubricate, is an essential step during sexual activity, but it usually comes after the initial stage of foreplay when both partners are sufficiently aroused. However, the use of lubrication can be worked into foreplay by incorporating it into sensual massages or manually stimulating one's partner. Option C, sleep, is not relevant to the foreplay process, as partners need to be awake and actively engaged in the experience. Option D, procreation, refers to the act of producing offspring through sexual intercourse. While procreation might be the ultimate goal for some couples, it does not qualify as a form of foreplay. Option E, sexual release, usually occurs after the completion of foreplay and sexual intercourse. Given that James and Judy are just starting their intimate encounter, sexual release is not the starting point but, instead, the culmination of their experiences."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Are Robert J. Flaherty and Andrew Niccol both directors of films? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, Robert J. Flaherty and Andrew Niccol are both directors of films. They have made significant contributions to the world of cinema through their exceptional directorial skills, unique perspectives, and thought-provoking works. Robert J. Flaherty (1884-1951) was an American filmmaker who is considered one of the pioneers of documentary filmmaking. He gained prominence in the early days of cinema, focusing primarily on ethnographic subjects. Flaherty was primarily concerned with capturing genuine footage that reflected the lives of different communities. He is best known for his documentary \\"Nanook of the North\\" (1922), which depicted the struggles of an Inuit family living in the Arctic regions of Canada. The success of \\"Nanook of the North\\" is often credited with establishing the documentary film genre. Flaherty went on to direct several other notable documentaries, including \\"Moana\\" (1926), \\"Man of Aran\\" (1934), and \\"Louisiana Story\\" (1948). Andrew Niccol (born 1964) is a New Zealand-born screenwriter, producer, and director. He gained recognition in the mid-1990s with his thought-provoking science fiction films. Niccol is known for his dystopian narratives and critiques of contemporary society. He made his directorial debut with the film \\"Gattaca\\" (1997), a sci-fi thriller that explored the implications of genetic engineering. \\"Gattaca\\" was well-received and is now considered a cult classic. Niccol continued his success as a director with movies such as \\"Simone\\" (2002), a satirical take on Hollywood and the concept of digital actors; \\"Lord of War\\" (2005), a film examining the arms trade and its impact on various conflicts; and \\"In Time\\" (2011), a dystopian story revolving around a society where time is the currency and the rich can live forever. Additionally, he wrote the screenplay for the critically acclaimed film \\"The Truman Show\\" (1998), directed by Peter Weir. In conclusion, both Robert J. Flaherty and Andrew Niccol are directors of films, with each making notable contributions to the world of cinema. They both have unique directorial styles and have dealt with thought-provoking subjects in their respective work. While Flaherty's focus lies mainly within the documentary genre, capturing the lives of various communities, Niccol's work revolves around science fiction and dystopian narratives that provoke reflection on contemporary society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Facebook and Microsoft Corp. representatives said Friday night that after negotiations with national security officials their companies have been given permission to make new but still very limited revelations about government orders to turn over user data. FILE - In this Tuesday, Dec. 13, 2011, file photo, a Facebook User Operations Safety Team worker looks at reviews at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. Facebook's top attorney says that after... (Associated Press) The announcements come at the end of a week when Facebook, Microsoft and Google, normally rivals, had jointly pressured the Obama administration to loosen their legal gag on national security orders. Those actions came after Edward Snowden, a 29-year-old American who works as a contract employee at the National Security Agency, revealed to The Guardian newspaper the existence of secret surveillance programs that gathered Americans' phone records and other data. The companies did not link their actions to Snowden's leaks. Ted Ullyot, Facebook's general counsel, said in a statement that Facebook is only allowed to talk about total numbers and must give no specifics. But he said the permission it has received is still unprecedented, and the company was lobbying to reveal more. Using the new guidelines, Ullyot said Facebook received between 9,000 and 10,000 government requests from all government entities from local to federal in the last six months of 2012, on topics including missing children investigations, fugitive tracking and terrorist threats. The requests involved the accounts of between 18,000 and 19,000 Facebook users. The companies were not allowed to make public how many orders they received from a particular agency or on a particular subject. But the numbers do include all national security related requests including those submitted via national security letters and under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which companies had not previously been allowed to reveal. The companies remain barred from revealing whether they've actually received FISA requests, and can only say that any they've received are included in the total reported figures. Microsoft released similar numbers for the same period, but downplayed how much they revealed. \\"We continue to believe that what we are permitted to publish continues to fall short of what is needed to help the community understand and debate these issues,\\" John Frank, Microsoft's vice president and deputy general counsel said in a statement. Frank said Microsoft received between 6,000 and 7,000 criminal and national security warrants, subpoenas and orders affecting between 31,000 and 32,000 accounts. Both attorneys emphasized in their statements that those affected by the orders represent a \\"tiny fraction\\" of their huge user bases. Google did not release its own numbers, saying late Friday that it was waiting to be able to reveal more specific and meaningful information. \\"We have always believed that it's important to differentiate between different types of government requests,\\" Google said in a statement. \\"We already publish criminal requests separately from national security letters. Lumping the two categories together would be a step back for users. Our request to the government is clear: to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosures, separately.\\" Facebook repeated recent assurances that the company scrutinizes every government request, and works aggressively to protect users' data. Facebook said it has a compliance rate of 79 percent on government requests. \\"We frequently reject such requests outright, or require the government to substantially scale down its requests, or simply give the government much less data than it has requested,\\" Ullyot said.\\" And we respond only as required by law.\\" ||||| SAN FRANCISCO -- Looking to shield itself from a growing public backlash over damaging revelations that it turned over user data to the National Security Agency's clandestine Internet surveillance program Prism, Facebook said late Friday it had reached an agreement to divulge some details about the government requests it receives for information about its users. Ted Ullyot, Facebook's general counsel, said the company had urged authorities \\"to allow more transparency and flexibility around national security-related orders we are required to comply with.\\" The result, he said, is Facebook's first-ever report on requests from the government for its users' information. PHOTOS: Last-minute Father's Day gift idea: Tablets under 200 Facebook says that in the second half of 2012, the total number of requests for user data that it received from all local, state and federal authorities was between 9,000 and 10,000. Those requests targeted between 18,000 and 19,000 accounts. Facebook complied with 79% of the requests, it said. The information does not break out national security requests. \\"The government will only authorize us to communicate about these numbers in aggregate and as a range,\\" Ullyot said. \\"This is progress, but we're continuing to push for even more transparency.\\" In a statement, a Google spokesman said the deal that Facebook struck with the government was not sufficient. \\"We have always believed that it's important to differentiate between different types of government requests. We already publish criminal requests separately from National Security Letters. Lumping the two categories together would be a step back for users,\\" he wrote. \\"Our request to the government is clear: to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosures, separately.\\" Google has gone to greater lengths than any other Web company to disclose the nature and number of government requests for information about its users through its semiannual \\"transparency report.\\" Facebook, Google, Microsoft and other technology giants have been pressing the Obama administration to allow them to publicly disclose more information about the national security requests they get under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The three-decade-old law lets intelligence agencies monitor the communications of non-U.S. citizens who are believed to be outside the United States and involved in terrorist or other criminal activities. FISA bars companies from even acknowledging they have received such requests. That secrecy has created a firestorm of controversy after revelations that technology companies have been turning over foreign users’ data to NSA. Google published an open letter this week to Atty. Gen. Eric Holder and FBI Director Robert Mueller to give it more freedom to share with users the number and scope of national security requests. \\"Assertions in the press that our compliance with these requests gives the U.S. government unfettered access to our users' data are simply untrue,\\" Google’s chief legal officer, David Drummond, wrote.

Both companies said the information they were allowed to publish falls short of what users need to better understand the issues. \\"We are permitted to publish data on national security orders received, but only if aggregated with law enforcement requests from all other U.S. local, state and federal law enforcement agencies,\\" Frank said. The Justice Department spokesperson said, \\"These aggregate totals include all instances in which a government entity has served lawful process on the providers - be it a grand jury subpoena or search warrant in a criminal matter, a national security letter, a court order under FISA, or another type of request pursuant to statutory authorization. \\"The publication of these numbers will show that an extraordinarily small number of accounts are subject to legal process. These agreements reflect our continued commitment to working with providers to afford greater transparency to the public while preserving confidentiality required for law enforcement or national security reasons.\\" Obama administration officials have pushed back against criticism on the domestic surveillance in the aftermath of the classified leaks last week that disclosed details of covert surveillance programs. Edward Snowden , 29, has admitted leaking the classified documents about the covert programs.

John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the judiciary panel. Conyers said he is co-sponsoring legislation that would address \\"the overbreadth and impenetrability of the surveillance programs.\\" Wrong public perception? But legislators of both parties joined Mueller in defending the programs. \\"This program does not target innocent Americans in any way, shape or form,\\" said House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican. \\"These programs have helped keep America safe. They have enhanced our ability to go after terrorists who want to bring harm to the American people.\\" Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said public perception of the government data mining was wrong. One of the programs, under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, collects billions of phone records to create a database for use in tracking suspected terrorists.

On October 5th, CNN interviewed a 25-year-old Syrian woman who had recently defected from Khansa’a brigade, an all-female ISIS division that enforces conservative social norms based on ISIS's radical interpretation of Islam — for instance, the Khansa'a would sometimes lash women for not wearing \\"the proper sharia clothing.\\" \\"Khadija\\" was an elementary school teacher before she convinced her family to move to Raqqa, ISIS's de facto capital in Syria — she had met a Tunisian ISIS sympathizer, who spoke of marrying her, through social media. \\"I got in touch with my cousin, and she said, 'You can come join us in the Khansa'a Brigade.' She was living in Raqqa with her husband who was with the Islamic State,\\" said Khadija. Khadija rationalized her initial attraction to the group. She saw ISIS as an extension of the early waves of dissent that have welled in Syria since March of 2011, back when the country's nascent uprising seemed like the latest chapter in the ongoing the Arab Spring, rather than the prelude to a horrific civil war. Her Tunisian recruiter also emphasized how the group would eventually overthrow the hated regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. \\"He would say, 'We are going to properly implement Islam. Right now we are in a state of war, a phase where we need to control the country, so we have to be harsh,'\\" Khadija told CNN. She patrolled the streets, armed and pleased at first with the authority she held. But she grew disillusioned with the group's cruelty. \\"There were cases where the wife had to be taken to the emergency ward because of the violence, the sexual violence,\\" she said in reference to foreign fighters specifically. She also witnessed a man's beheading. \\"I said enough, after everything I had already seen and all the times I had stayed silent,\\" Khadija said to CNN. The interview is especially valuable in exposing the blurred lines that run through the power vacuum in Syria. At one point, it seems, ISIS was able to harness the energies of a disappointed revolution and convince some beleaguered Syrian that the Islamic State was a viable manifestation of Syria's anti-government struggle. But Khadija shows how that can backfire — and how ISIS's tactics are so brutal that they're capable of alienating even a once-loyal foot soldier. ||||| Story highlights 25-year-old joined ISIS after chaos following protests against Syrian president Lured by man she met online, she became interested in ISIS She joined female police brigade that enforces ISIS rules on women She witnessed beheading and violence against women The petite 25-year-old tentatively opens the door to the hotel room where we've agreed to meet. Her face is covered, but her body language betrays her anxiety. She slowly lifts her niqab, revealing her young, heart-shaped face. Her large brown eyes, filled with guilt and turmoil, are delicately made up under perfectly sculpted brows. She calls herself 'Khadija.' It's not her real name, because she's a marked woman. Once a member of a fearsome, female ISIS brigade, she's a recent defector, disillusioned by the group's brutality. Her interview with CNN is the first time she has ever told anyone her story. 'I ran away to something uglier' Growing up in Syria, Khadija's family ensured she got an education. She earned her college degree and began teaching elementary school. Khadija describes her family and upbringing as \\"not overly conservative.\\" JUST WATCHED Kassig: 'I believe in hopeless causes' Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Strikes in Syria bring civilian casualties 03:14 When the Syrian uprising began more than three and a half years ago, Khadija joined the masses who began peaceful protests against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. \\"We'd go out and demonstrate. The security services would chase us. We'd write on walls, have different outfits to change into,\\" she said. \\"Those days were great.\\" But it was when the Syrian uprising spiraled into chaos and violence that she said she began to lose her soul, her humanity. \\"Everything around us was chaos,\\" she said, her words tumbling out. \\"Free Syrian Army, the regime, barrel bombs, strikes, the wounded, clinics, blood -- you want to tear yourself away, to find something to run to. \\"My problem was I ran away to something uglier.\\" Gradual induction She found herself drawn to the eloquence of a Tunisian whom she met online. Taken with his manners, she grew to trust him over time and he gradually lured her into the Islamic State, she said. He assured her that the group was not what people thought, that it was not a terrorist organization. \\"He would say, 'We are going to properly implement Islam. Right now we are in a state of war, a phase where we need to control the country, so we have to be harsh.'\\" He told her he was coming to the Syrian city of Raqqa, that they could even get married. \\"I got in touch with my cousin, and she said, 'You can come join us in the Khansa'a Brigade. She was living in Raqqa with her husband who was with the Islamic State,\\" Khadija said. The brigade is the feared, all-female police for ISIS. Khadija convinced her family to move to Raqqa, saying it would be easier to register her younger siblings in school, and that they would have the support of relatives. With her cousin to open the doors, Khadija was welcomed into the feared Khansa'a brigade. Inside the female ISIS brigade The Khansa'a Brigade is made up of around 25 to 30 women and is tasked with patrolling the streets of Raqqa to ensure that women adhere to proper clothing as outlined by the Islamic State.

Women are not allowed to show their eyes. Those who broke the laws are lashed. The lashings to the women who broke ISIS rules were carried out by Umm Hamza. When Khadija first saw Umm Hamza, she was terrified. \\"She's not a normal female. She's huge, she has an AK, a pistol, a whip, a dagger and she wears the niqab,\\" Khadija said. Brigade commander Umm Rayan sensed Khadija's fear \\"and she got close to me and said a sentence I won't forget. She said, 'We are harsh with the infidels, but merciful among ourselves.'\\" Khadija was trained to clean, dismantle, and fire a weapon. She was paid 200 a month and received food rations. Her family sensed Khadija was slipping away, but were helpless to stop it. Her mother tried to warn her. \\"She would always say to me, 'Wake up, take care of yourself. You are walking, but you don't know where you are going.'\\" Second thoughts Initally, Khadija did not pay attention to her mother's warnings, seduced by the sense of power. But eventually, she started questioning herself and the principles of the Islamic State. \\"At the start, I was happy with my job. I felt that I had authority in the streets. But then I started to get scared, scared of my situation. I even started to be afraid of myself.\\" She started thinking: \\"I am not like this. I have a degree in education. I shouldn't be like this. What happened to me? What happened in my mind that brought me here?\\" And her image of ISIS began to crumble. Burned into her mind is an image she saw online of a 16-year-old boy who was crucified for rape. She questioned her inclusion in a group capable of such violence. \\"The worst thing I saw was a man getting his head hacked off in front of me,\\" she said. Violence against women Even more personally, she witnessed ISIS' brand of violence reserved for women. The brigade shared its building with a man who specialized in marriage for ISIS fighters. \\"He was one of the worst people,\\" she said of the man tasked with finding wives for both local and foreign fighters. \\"The foreign fighters are very brutal with women, even the ones they marry,\\" she said. \\"There were cases where the wife had to be taken to the emergency ward because of the violence, the sexual violence.\\" Khadija saw a future she did not want. With her commander pressuring her to submit to marriage, Khadija decided she needed to leave the brigade. \\"So it was at this point, I said enough. After all that I had already seen and all the times I stayed silent, telling myself, 'We're at war, then it will all be rectified.' \\"But after this, I decided no, I have to leave.\\" Khadija left just days before the coalition airstrikes, but her family remains in Syria. She was smuggled across the border to Turkey. Life after ISIS Khadija still wears the niqab, not just to conceal her identity but also because she's struggling to adapt back to life outside the Islamic State. Regretful of her immersion in radical Islam, she is wary of another sudden change. \\"It has to be gradual, so that I don't become someone else. I am afraid of becoming someone else. Someone who swings, as a reaction in the other direction, after I was so entrenched in religion, that I reject religion completely,\\" she said. Towards the end of our interview, speaking about how ISIS could have gotten a foothold in parts of Syrian society, she has a personal moment. \\"How did we allow them to come in? How did we allow them to rule us? There is a weakness in us.\\" Khadija spoke to us because she said she wants people, especially women, to know the truth about ISIS. \\"I don't want anyone else to be duped by them. Too many girls think they are the right Islam,\\" she said. She desperately wants to be the girl she was before falling under the spell of ISIS -- \\"a girl who is merry, who loves life and laughter... who loves to travel, to draw, to walk in the street with her headphones listening to music without caring what anyone thinks,\\" she said. \\"I want to be like that again.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A recent interview with a 25-year-old woman who defected from ISIS's all-female Khansa'a brigade provides insight into the workings of the terror organization.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Acornsoft was the software arm of Acorn Computers, and a major publisher of software for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron. As well as games, it also produced a large number of educational titles, extra computer languages and business and utility packages these included word processor \\"VIEW\\" and the spreadsheet \\"ViewSheet\\" supplied on ROM and cartridge for the BBC Micro/Acorn Electron and included as standard in the BBC Master and Acorn Business Computer. - Professor Peter D. Killworth (27 March 1946 28 January 2008) was an English scientist known for both his work on oceanography and the study of social networks. A prolific writer, he published more than 160 scientific papers over the course of his career. He was also known for his work as a pioneering author of text interactive fiction games during the early 1980s. - BBC BASIC is a programming language, developed in 1981 as a native programming language for the MOS Technology 6502 based Acorn BBC Micro home/personal computer, mainly by Sophie Wilson. It is a version of the BASIC programming language adapted for a UK computer literacy project of the BBC. - The Acorn Electron is a budget version of the BBC Micro educational/home computer made by Acorn Computers Ltd. It has 32 kilobytes of RAM, and its ROM includes BBC BASIC v2 along with its operating system. - Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of Interactive narratives or Interactive narrations. These works can also be understood as a form of video game, either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game. In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be \\"text-only\\", however, Graphical text adventure games, where the text is accompanied by graphics (still images, animations or video) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text. Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction, known as \\"Puzzle-free\\", that focuses on narrative, and \\"text adventures\\" that focus on puzzles. - Countdown to Doom is a text adventure computer game, more recently termed interactive fiction, written in 1982 by Peter Killworth. Its setting is the planet Doomawangara, which is coyly said to be shortened to \\"Doom\\". There are two sequels, \\"Return to Doom\\" and \\"Last Days of Doom\\". - Acorn Computers Ltd. was a British computer company established in Cambridge, England, in 1978. The company produced a number of computers which were especially popular in the UK, including the Acorn Electron and the Acorn Archimedes. Acorn's BBC Micro computer dominated the UK educational computer market during the 1980s. It is more known for its computer than for its other products. - The Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge, England and sold in the late-1980s to mid-1990s, their first general purpose home computer based on their own ARM architecture (then the CPU and architecture was known as Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM, that later became one of the most widely used CPU architectures in the world, e.g. used in most smartphones). The first Archimedes was launched in 1987. - The kilobyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The International System of Units (SI) defines the prefix \\"kilo\\" as 1000 (10); therefore one kilobyte is 1000 bytes. The unit symbol for the kilobyte is kB. In information technology, particularly in reference to main memory capacity, \\"kilobyte\\" is traditionally used to denote 1024 (2) bytes. This arises from the powers-of-two sizing common to such memory in digital circuitry. In this context, the symbols K and KB are often used when 1024 bytes is meant. - Oceanography (compound of the Greek words meaning \\"ocean\\" and meaning \\"write\\"), also known as oceanology, is the study of the physical and the biological aspects of the ocean. It is an Earth science covering a wide range of topics, including ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within: astronomy, biology, chemistry, climatology, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology and physics. Paleoceanography studies the history of the oceans in the geologic past. - Castle of Riddles is a text adventure released by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro ( in 1982 ) and Acorn Electron ( 1984 ) home computers . The game was written by Peter Killworth and was one of a series of text adventures written for , or ported to the BBC Micro by the same author ( others including Countdown to Doom and Philosopher 's Quest ) . As with all such games , only text is used . The player must use a simple ' verb - noun ' format ( e.g. ' Go North ' , ' Get lamp ' ) to control the game . Unlike Killworth 's other Acornsoft adventures , Castle of Riddles was not updated and reissued by Topologika so became unavailable after 1985 when Acorn Computers ( parent company of Acornsoft ) pulled out of the games publishing market . Some of the puzzles however were included in the Topologika version of Philosopher 's Quest . - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Topologika Software Ltd was an independent British publisher of educational software. Established in Stilton, Cambridgeshire in 1983, the company spent most of its life in Penryn, Cornwall before moving to Brighton, Sussex. The company was dissolved at the end of June 2013. Its educational software continues to be sold by distributors REM via , and is still supported by Topologika's founder Brian Kerslake. - The BBC Microcomputer System, or BBC Micro, is a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by the Acorn Computer company for the \\"BBC Computer Literacy Project\\", operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Designed with an emphasis on education, it was notable for its ruggedness, expandability, and the quality of its operating system. An accompanying 1982 television series \\"\\"The Computer Programme\\"\\" featuring Chris Serle learning to use the machine was also broadcast on BBC 2. - The Acorn Business Computer (ABC) was a series of microcomputers announced at the end of 1983 by the British company Acorn Computers. The series of eight computers was aimed at the business, research and further education markets. However, the ABC range was cancelled before any of the models were shipped to customers. The ABC 210 was subsequently relaunched as the Acorn Cambridge Workstation, sold in modest numbers to academic and scientific users.

Summarize this article: At the start of 2016, single coins were only worth around 435 but their value has climbed steadily all year. The steady upward progress has continued despite regular hack attacks on virtual currency exchanges in which coins have been stolen. Experts said the rise in value was linked to the long-term depreciation of the Chinese Yuan. The Chinese currency has dropped about 7% in value during 2016, said Reuters. The majority of Bitcoin currency trading takes place in China as it allows people to skirt restrictive local laws that limit how much money Chinese people can swap. Charles Hayter, founder of the Cryptocompare website that watches virtual currencies, said global political uncertainty and Indian moves to control paper currency were also driving people to buy Bitcoins. If those trends continued, he told Reuters, many more people may be tempted to buy Bitcoins as they could be seen as a \\"flight to safety\\". Hackers have also been tempted by the rising value of the virtual coins. In August Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex suffered a major hack attack in which bitcoins worth 65m were thought to be taken. Bitcoin values dropped about 10% when the news of the hack attack was made public The virtual currency has yet to reach the heights it managed in late 2013 when each coin was worth more than 1,000. The total value of all bitcoins in circulation has now surpassed 14bn.","completion":"Alright kiddo, so we're talking about something called Bitcoin, which is a type of money people use on the internet. At the beginning of 2016, one Bitcoin was worth about 435. But now, it's worth even more! This happened even though some mean people on the internet tried to steal it. Now some folks think the value went up because another type of money, the Chinese Yuan, went down in value. Most people who trade Bitcoin live in China, so when the value of their money drops, they may start using more Bitcoins. A man named Charles Hayter, who watches this kind of stuff, thinks that people are buying more Bitcoins because they're worried about what's happening in the world, and because of some stuff happening in India with their paper money. But, just like in a superhero movie, when something gets very powerful, the bad guys want it. Some hackers (the bad guys on the internet) stole a lot of Bitcoins, and when that happened, the value of the Bitcoins dropped a bit. But even with all that, the Bitcoin is still not as high in value as it was in 2013, when it was worth more than 1000 for just one. But if you take all the Bitcoins in the world, they are now worth more than 14 billion dollars! Phew, that's a big number!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During the nine-month-long Bangladesh war for independence, members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami killed up to 3,000,000 people and raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. Some estimates mention the number of people killed between 300,000500,000, and describe the 3 million number as excessively inflated. The actions against women were supported by Imams and Muslim religious leaders, who declared that Bengali women were 'war-booty'.

In many systems, the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the government. In most systems, the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet. In a minority of systems, notably in semi-presidential systems of government, a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state. In parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system, the prime minister is the presiding and actual head of government and head of the executive branch.

It states that nations, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference. This principle can be traced to the Atlantic Charter, signed on 14 August 1941, by Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, and Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who pledged The Eight Principal points of the Charter. It also is derived from principles espoused by United States President Woodrow Wilson following World War I, after which some new nation states were formed, or previous states were revived after the dissolution of empires. The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or full assimilation. Neither does it state what the delimitation between nations should benor what constitutes a nation. There are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination. - The Bangladesh Awami League (Bengali transliteration: ; translated from Urdu: Bangladesh People's League); AL is one of the two major political parties of Bangladesh.

It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language. - Myanmar, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and also known as Burma, is a sovereign state in South East Asia bordered by Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand.

The original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on March 26, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military, within one month. President Yahya Khan at a conference in February 1971 said \\"Kill three million of them and the rest will eat out of our hands.\\" Prolonged Bengali resistance was not anticipated by the Pakistani military leaders. The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in Bengali hands in mid-May. The operation also precipitated the 1971 Bangladesh genocide and caused roughly 10 million refugees to flee to India as well as the death of up to 3,000,000 civilians. Bengali intelligentsia, academics and Hindus were targeted for the harshest treatment, with significant indiscriminate killing taking place.

Neil Elder. - A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with large numbers of beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals. - Bhutan ('), officially the Kingdom of Bhutan ('), is a landlocked country and the smallest state in Asia to be located entirely within the Himalaya mountain range. Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it is bordered by China in the north and India in the south.

They later organised a trivia contest between teams. and a hint : Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. Please answer this question : Which team studied less about the buildup of lactic acid? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, team A studied less about the buildup of lactic acid. Team A focused their studies on alcoholic fermentation, while team B learned more about lactic fermentation. Alcoholic fermentation involves the conversion of sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide by the action of yeast. This process plays a significant role in the production of alcoholic beverages like beer and wine, as well as the production of other consumables like bread. On the other hand, lactic fermentation is a process that involves the conversion of sugars into lactic acid by certain types of bacteria and fungi. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process, and it plays a vital role in various biological and industrial processes. In our body, our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, as oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to cause muscle soreness after exercise. Moreover, lactic acid-producing bacteria are used in the food industry to make products like cheese and yogurt, causing the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid is also responsible for tooth decay, as bacteria in the mouth use sugars for energy. Given that team B explored lactic fermentation, they would have learned more about the buildup of lactic acid and its effects on the human body and in industrial applications. Team A, who studied alcoholic fermentation, would have had less exposure to information about lactic acid and its buildup.

Answer a question about this article: In 1830, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria across the centre of England to visit the Malvern Hills, stopping at towns and great country houses along the way. Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. To the King's annoyance, Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops. William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heiress presumptive. Victoria disliked the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little time for her to rest. She objected on the grounds of the King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy, and forced Victoria to continue the tours. At Ramsgate in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever, which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence. While Victoria was ill, Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary.

However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained. On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month.On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: \\"At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\\" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.Nansen called this first land \\"Hvidtenland\\" (\\"White Island\\").

I was hesitant to check this place out even after two friend recommendations-a three star rated place is always a risk. It could go either way. Fortunately, my two treks (and counting) to Polished have been positive experiences. What I like most about this place is that you can make your appointment online. The system is easy to use and you get a confirmation once a human on the other end processes your request. I do remember reading in someone's review that Polished is run like a train station, which I guess I can equate the online system to. You pick out the exact service, time and technician that you want, and I'm not sure how forgiving they are should you change your mind last minute. I've haven't had a problem with customer service and I guess my only complaint is my appointment was behind about 10 minutes on my first visit. I definitely recommend making an appointment and my technician told me that they're actually busier on the weekdays than the weekend. The salon is clean, modern and pretty spacious (they're about to expand into some space next door) and has an abundant amount of stations. The technicians are setup two to a table and I imagine it can get pretty cramped but I was lucky there was no one sitting in my immediate surrounding area the times I went. The two friends who recommended Polished to me raved about their gel selection which is pretty expansive. All of the polishes and gel samples are set up at the right of the entrance and it can be kind of overwhelming if you don't get your nails done that often.

Process: - A can is thrown away into a recycling bin - The can is taken to a recycling center - Melted down along with other cans - The melted metal is turned into bars - Becomes material for other products. Question: suppose people use more reusable containers happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The increasing use of reusable containers in society would have a significant effect on the overall demand for aluminum cans and their recycling process. This shift towards a more sustainable lifestyle would help in reducing the environmental impact of single-use cans and minimizing the need for raw materials in manufacturing new cans. However, it is important to analyze how this change influences the recycling of aluminum cans and subsequent effects in the entire production and recycling cycle. Here is a detailed explanation. Recycling aluminum cans in general has a massive positive impact on the environment, as it not only conserves natural resources, but also saves up to 95% of the energy required in the production of aluminum from raw bauxite ore. Now, let's discuss the effects of increased use of reusable containers on aluminum cans recycling: 1. Less demand for aluminum cans: With more people adopting reusable containers, the demand for single-use aluminum cans will decrease. Consequently, fewer cans would be thrown away, leading to a decreased availability of aluminum cans for recycling centers. 2. Reduced production of aluminum cans: As the demand for aluminum cans declines, manufacturers would scale back their production, further contributing to a reduced need for recycling. This would result in less aluminum waste generated, ultimately lowering the requirement for recycling centers. 3. Lower recycling volumes: A reduced demand for aluminum cans would lead to less recycling overall. This would put less pressure on recycling centers, which might adjust their operations accordingly. They might focus on alternative recycling streams, such as paper, glass, or plastics, to compensate for the reduced aluminum cans recycling. 4. Impact on the second effect mentioned, the melting process: With the decreased volume of aluminum cans available for recycling, less metal would be melted down, and fewer bars would be produced. Consequently, the perturbation of increased reusable container usage would have a \\"less\\" effect on the melting process and the creation of metal bars. This reduction in the aluminum reclamation process could potentially contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption in the recycling industry. 5. Creation of alternative jobs and industries: While the recycling volume for aluminum cans would be diminished, the growing market for reusable containers would create new jobs and businesses opportunities in the production of reusable bottles and containers, potentially compensating for the lost jobs and revenue in the aluminum can recycling industry. In conclusion, the increased use of reusable containers would have a \\"less\\" effect on the recycling of aluminum cans, specifically the second effect mentioned, melting the cans and turning them into bars. This perturbation would lead to a decrease in the overall volume of aluminum cans produced and recycled, resulting in a more eco-conscious lifestyle and, ultimately, lower environmental impact."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President-elect Donald Trump (all times EST): 12:20 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to end the detente with Cuba initiated by the Obama administration. Trump tweeted Monday he \\"will terminate\\" President Barack Obama's reestablishment of diplomatic ties and normalization of relations if \\"Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole.\\" But Trump's warning could face opposition from some Republicans on Capitol Hill and corporate leaders who see continued engagement with Havana as good for American businesses and the best way to force the Cuban government to change. Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said this past weekend a \\"get tough\\" policy that isolates Havana and restricts travel and commerce will hurt the Cuban people and make the U.S. government \\"a convenient scapegoat for failed socialist policies.\\" __ 11:55 a.m. The Green Party says it will ask a Pennsylvania court to order a statewide recount of the state's Nov. 8 presidential election result. But it's unclear if the courts would have authority to do so. A lawyer for Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein wouldn't discuss what would be alleged in the expected lawsuit Monday. Republican President-elect Donald Trump edged Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 71,000 votes, or about 1 percent, in Pennsylvania. Democratic Secretary of State Pedro Cortes says there's no evidence of voting irregularities or cyberattacks on Pennsylvania's voting machines, 96 percent of which record votes electronically and leave no paper trail. A GOP lawyer says the courts lack authority to order a statewide recount. Cortes says he's also unaware of the courts having authority to do so __ 11:50 a.m. A Republican member of the Electoral College from Texas says he's resigning so he won't cast one of the state's 38 electoral votes for Donald Trump. Art Sisneros previously told The Associated Press that he was wavering on supporting Trump because the Republican \\"is not biblically qualified for office.\\" In a lengthy weekend blog post, Sisneros updated that, saying \\"the best option I see at this time is to resign my position as an elector.\\" Texas doesn't require its presidential electors to vote in accordance with the state's presidential election results. Trump won Texas by around 9 percentage points and captured 290 overall electoral votes to Hillary Clinton's 232. Texas electors meet in Austin next month to vote for president. By state law, they can vote then on a replacement for Sisneros. __ 10 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump is claiming, without evidence, that millions of people voted illegally in the election he won, issuing the baseless claim as part of his angry response to a recount effort led by the Green Party and joined by Hillary Clinton's campaign. Trump tweeted on Sunday that he won the popular vote \\"if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\\" He later alleged \\"serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California.\\" Trump's transition team did not provide any evidence to back up the president-elect's assertions of fraud in the November election. They pointed only to past charges of irregularities in voter registration. There has been no evidence of widespread tampering or hacking that would change the results of the presidential contest between Trump and Clinton. |||||","completion":"The article covers a multitude of topics related to politics and President-elect Donald Trump in November 2016. Beginning with a description of ongoing work on a presidential reviewing stand on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C., it sets the stage for coverage of recent events. The article then highlights that as of 12:20 PM, President-elect Trump, using Twitter as his mode of communication, is threatening to end the détente with Cuba initiated by the Obama administration. He is considering terminating Obama’s reestablishment of diplomatic ties and normalization of relations if Cuba does not agree to a more beneficial deal for the Cuban and Cuban-American people, and the U.S. overall. However, this warning might face opposition from some Republicans on Capitol Hill and corporate leaders who view continued engagement with Havana as potentially beneficial for American businesses and also a method to encourage change within the Cuban government. Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona raised concern that a hard-line policy that isolates Havana and restricts travel and commerce would adversely affect the Cuban populace and make the U.S. government a scapegoat for failed socialist policies. At 11:55 AM, the Green Party announced its intention to ask a Pennsylvania court to order a statewide recount of the state's November 8 presidential election result. The anticipatory lawsuit is set to challenge the victory of Republican President-elect Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 71,000 votes. However, it remains uncertain if the courts hold authority to order such recount. The Democratic Secretary of State, Pedro Cortes, has asserted that there is no evidence of voting irregularities or cyberattacks on Pennsylvania's voting machines, and a GOP lawyer has stated that the courts lack authority to order a statewide recount. By 11:50 AM, a Republican member of the Electoral College from Texas, Art Sisneros, has announced his resignation, due to his unwillingness to cast one of the state's 38 electoral votes for Donald Trump. Sisneros, who had previously claimed uncertainty in supporting Trump as he felt the Republican \\"is not biblically qualified for office\\", decided that resignation was his best option. Finally, at 10:00 AM, the article informs that Trump, without offering any concrete proof, has claimed via Twitter that millions of people voted illegally in the election he won. This unfounded claim was made in response to a recount effort led by the Green Party and joined by Hillary Clinton's campaign. Trump’s transition team did not provide any evidence to substantiate these claims and only referenced past charges of irregularities in voter registration.

Article: A good joke can be the hardest thing to understand when studying a foreign language. As a recent article in The Guardian newspaper noted, \\"There's more to understanding a joke in a foreign language than understanding vocabulary and grammar.\\" Being able to understand local jokes is often seen as an incredible ice-breaker for a language learner eager to form friendships with native speakers. \\"I always felt that humor was a ceiling that I could never break through,\\" Hannah Ashley, a public relations account manager in London, who once studied Spanish in Madrid. Told The Guardian, \\"I could never speak to people on the same level as I would speak to a native English speaker. I almost came across as quite a boring person because all I could talk about was facts.\\" In fact, most of the time, jokes are only funny for people who share a cultural background or understand humor in the same way. Chinese-American comedian Joe Wong found this out first-hand. He had achieved huge success in the US, but when he returned to China in 2008 for his first live show in Beijing, he discovered that people didn't think his. Chinese jokes were as funny as his English ones. In Australia, meanwhile many foreigners find understanding jokes about sports to be the biggest headache. \\"The hardest jokes are related to rugby because I know nothing about rugby,\\" said Melody Cao, who was once a student in Australia. \\"When I heard jokes I didn't get, I just laughed along.\\" In the other two major English-speaking countries, the sense of humor is also different. British comedian Simon Pegg believes that while Britons use irony-basically, saying something they don't mean to make a joke-every day, people in the US don't see the point of using it so often. \\"British jokes tend to be more subtle and dark, while American jokes are more obvious with their meanings, a bit like Americans themselves,\\" he wrote in The Guardian.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Hope is traditionally considered by Christians as a theological virtue (a virtue associated with the grace of God, rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless. In late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that...

Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation. Who is less likely to experience internal organ failure? Hint: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"Robert is less likely to experience internal organ failure, as he only suffered low doses of radiation compared to Michael, who was exposed to high doses of radiation.

(June 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film is set in Great Britain and Ireland, in the Dark Ages, after the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century. Lord Marke of Cornwall plans to unify the peoples of Britain â Celts, Angles, Saxons, and Jutes â under himself as high king to resist Irish domination. Most lords agree to this, as Marke is highly regarded and respected as a fair and courageous leader. The Irish king Donnchadh discovers this and sends troops to attack a Jutish castle where a treaty between the British tribes is being discussed. The raid claims the lives of the castle's lord and his wife, but Marke manages to save their son, Tristan, at the cost of losing a hand. Feeling compassion for the young boy, whose father loyally supported him, Marke welcomes Tristan into his home and regards him as a son. Nine years later, Tristan has grown into a fierce, courageous warrior whose loyalty to Marke is not that of a knight to his lord, but rather a son to his father. Tristan and other Cornish warriors launch an attack on an Irish slave caravan. Tristan fights Morholt, the champion and leader of the army of Donnchadh, whose lord's daughter, Princess Isolde, has been promised to Morholt in marriage. Though Tristan kills Morholt and Donnchadh's forces are overrun, he is severely wounded in the fight and believed dead, though he is in fact only suffering the effects of Morholt's poisoned sword.

Background: The Lenape (English: or ), also called the Leni Lenape, Lenni Lenape and Delaware people, are an indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands, who live in Canada and the United States. Their historical territory included present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River watershed, New York City, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley. Today, Lenape people belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Wisconsin, and the Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario. The Lenape have a matrilineal clan system and historically were matrilocal. Context: New Amsterdam was founded in 1624 by the Dutch in what would later become New York City. Dutch settlers also founded a colony at present-day Lewes, Delaware on June 3, 1631 and named it Zwaanendael (Swan Valley). The colony had a short life, as in 1632 a local band of Lenape killed the 32 Dutch settlers after a misunderstanding escalated over Lenape defacement of the insignia of the Dutch West India Company. In 1634, the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock went to war with the Lenape over access to trade with the Dutch at New Amsterdam. They defeated the Lenape, and some scholars believe that the Lenape may have become tributaries to the Susquehannock. After the warfare, the Lenape referred to the Susquehannock as \\"uncles.\\" The Iroquois added the Lenape to the Covenant Chain in 1676; the Lenape were tributary to the Five Nations (later Six) until 1753, shortly before the outbreak of the French and Indian War (a part of the Seven Years' War in Europe). The Lenape's quick adoption of trade goods, and their need to trap furs to meet high European demand, resulted in their disastrous over-harvesting of the beaver population in the lower Hudson Valley. With the fur sources exhausted, the Dutch shifted their operations to present-day upstate New York. The Lenape who produced wampum in the vicinity of Manhattan Island temporarily forestalled the negative effects of the decline in trade. Lenape population fell sharply during this period, due to high fatalities from epidemics of infectious diseases carried by Europeans, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity, as the diseases had arisen on the Asian continent and moved west into Europe, where they had become endemic in the cities. The Lenape had a culture in which the clan and family controlled property. Europeans often tried to contract for land with the tribal chiefs, confusing their culture with that of neighboring tribes such as the Iroquois. The Lenape would petition for grievances on the basis that not all their families had been recognized in the transaction (not that they wanted to \\"share\\" the land). After the Dutch arrival in the 1620s, the Lenape were successful in restricting Dutch settlement until the 1660s to Pavonia in present-day Jersey City along the Hudson. The Dutch finally established a garrison at Bergen, which allowed settlement west of the Hudson within the province of New Netherland. This land was purchased from the Lenape after the fact. In 1682, William Penn and Quaker colonists created the English colony of Pennsylvania beginning at the lower Delaware River. A peace treaty was negotiated between the newly arriving English and Lenape at what is now known as Penn Treaty Park. In the decades immediately following, some 20,000 new colonists arrived in the region, putting pressure on Lenape settlements and hunting grounds. Although Penn endeavored to live peaceably with the Lenape and to create a colony that would do the same, he also expected his authority and that of the colonial government to take precedence. His new colony effectively displaced many Lenape and forced others to adapt to new cultural demands. Penn gained a reputation for benevolence and tolerance, but his efforts resulted in more effective colonization of the ancestral Lenape homeland than previous ones. Question: What else happened in the 17th century? Answer:","completion":"In the 17th century, many other important events happened around the world. Here are some examples: 1. The scientific revolution: During this time, many great scientists like Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, and Robert Boyle made significant discoveries and developed new ideas about the natural world, changing the way people understood the universe. 2.

Many people were accused of practicing witchcraft, and some were executed, leading to a lot of fear and chaos in the community. 4. The founding of colonies: Many European countries, like England, France, and the Netherlands, continued to explore and establish colonies in different parts of the world, including North America, the Caribbean, and Asia. This period saw a significant expansion and competition for resources, territories, and trade. Remember that these are just a few examples of the many events that took place during the 17th century, as people all around the world experienced changes in their lives, societies, and understanding of the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Orphanage Movie plot: In 1975 Spain, a young girl named Laura is given up for adoption. Years later, adult Laura (Rueda) returns to the closed orphanage, accompanied by her husband, Carlos (Cayo), and their seven-year-old adopted son, SimÃ³n (PrÃ­ncep). She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children. SimÃ³n claims to see a boy named TomÃ¡s (Ãscar Casas). He befriends TomÃ¡s and draws pictures of him as a child wearing a sack mask. Social worker Benigna Escobedo (Montserrat Carulla) informs Laura that SimÃ³n's adoption file indicates that SimÃ³n is HIV positive. Incensed at Benigna's intrusion, Laura asks her to leave. She later finds Benigna in the orphanage's coal shed, but Benigna flees the scene. Later, SimÃ³n teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to SimÃ³n's adoption file. SimÃ³n becomes angry, and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and that he is going to die soon. During a party at the orphanage, Laura and SimÃ³n argue, and SimÃ³n hides from her. While looking for him, she encounters a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. Escaping, she finds that SimÃ³n is missing and she is unable to find him. That night Laura hears several loud crashes. Police psychologist Pilar (Mabel Rivera) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted SimÃ³n. Six months later, SimÃ³n is still missing. Searching in a Spanish city, Laura spots Benigna who is then struck and killed by a car. The police find evidence that Benigna once worked at the orphanage, and that she had a son named TomÃ¡s who was interned there. The children stole a mask that TomÃ¡s wore to conceal his deformed face. Embarrassed, TomÃ¡s hid in a local sea cave and was subsequently drowned. His death occurred weeks after Laura was adopted. Laura asks for the assistance of a medium named Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin) in the search for SimÃ³n. Aurora conducts a seance during which she claims to see the ghosts of the orphans crying for...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt into a bowl - Mix in milk, eggs, and melted butter - Mix until smooth - Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium high - Pour batter onto the griddle - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more sugar is used happens, how will it affect there will be less mixture. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context suggests that adding more sugar to the pancake batter will result in a lesser amount of mixture. To fully understand the effects of this supposed perturbation on the process, let's first analyze the existing recipe and methodology. Then, we will discuss the possible direct and indirect effects of adding more sugar to the mixture. 1. The existing recipe and methodology: The current pancake recipe calls for mixing flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl, followed by milk, eggs, and melted butter. The batter is then mixed until smooth and cooked on a griddle or frying pan at medium-high heat. 2. Direct effects of adding more sugar: Adding more sugar to the pancake batter will directly affect the taste, texture, and color of the pancakes. The increased sugar content will cause the pancakes to taste sweeter and may also result in a slightly denser texture due to the higher ratio of sugar to other dry ingredients. Additionally, incorporating more sugar into the batter may cause the pancakes to brown more quickly on the griddle, as sugar caramelizes at high temperatures. It is important to keep a close eye on the cooking process to avoid over-browning or burning the pancakes. 3. Indirect effects on the amount of pancake batter: The perturbation hypothesis poses the possibility that adding more sugar to the pancake batter will result in a lesser amount of mixture. However, adding more sugar to the recipe does not directly reduce the overall volume of the batter unless the other ingredients are correspondingly reduced. In fact, increasing the amount of sugar while maintaining the quantities of other ingredients will result in a slightly larger volume of batter. Nonetheless, it is crucial to consider the less apparent effect of adding more sugar on the recipe. The increased sugar content could potentially influence the perceived yield of the batter due to its impact on the texture of the pancakes. As mentioned earlier, incorporating more sugar might result in denser pancakes. Consequently, the cook may use a larger amount of batter for each pancake to achieve the desired thickness, inadvertently reducing the total number of pancakes produced. 4. Conclusion: The supposed perturbation – adding more sugar to the pancake batter – does not directly cause a reduction in the volume of the mixture. The direct effects of the additional sugar involve alterations to the taste, texture, and browning of the pancakes during cooking. However, indirect effects on the amount of batter may result from the cook's assumption and desire to maintain the desired thickness of the pancakes, which could lead to fewer pancakes being produced from the same volume of batter. Ultimately, while the perturbation does not directly impact the overall amount of mixture, it may have indirect consequences on the process due to adjustments made during cooking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To reupholster a dining room chair,","completion":"To reupholster a dining room chair, follow this detailed step-by-step guide to ensure a high-quality and professional-looking outcome: 1. Gather necessary materials and tools: - Fabric (choose a durable upholstery fabric, and purchase enough to cover all the chair(s) with some extra for contingency) - Staple remover or flat-head screwdriver - Scissors - Measuring tape - Pliers - Staple gun and staples (or upholstery tacks, if preferred) - Foam padding (optional) - Batting (optional) - Upholstery or fabric glue - Protective eyewear and gloves - Screwdriver or Allen wrench (to remove the chair seat) 2. Assess the chair and remove the seat cushion: - Examine the chair to determine if it needs any repairs. Fix any loose or broken parts before proceeding with the upholstery. - Turn the chair upside down and locate the screws or bolts holding the seat cushion to the chair frame. Remove these using a screwdriver or Allen wrench, and carefully lift the seat cushion away from the frame. 3. Remove old upholstery: - Put on protective eyewear and gloves for safety. - With the seat cushion removed, carefully pry off the old staples, tacks, or other fasteners securing the upholstery using a staple remover or flathead screwdriver. - Remove the fabric and any underlying padding, and discard or recycle them if they are not reusable. 4. Measure and cut new upholstery fabric: - Measure the dimensions of the seat cushion, adding at least 2-3 inches to each side to allow for wrapping around the seat cushion's edges. - Create a template of the seat shape with paper or cardboard, if needed. - Lay out the upholstery fabric on a flat surface, and position your template on top of the fabric, ensuring the fabric pattern aligns if there is one. - Use scissors to cut the fabric, following the template's shape and dimensions. 5. Install new padding, if necessary: - If the existing padding or foam is worn out or damaged, replace it with a new one that fits the thickness you desire. - Measure and cut the foam padding to match the size and shape of the seat cushion. - Place it on top of the seat cushion and secure it with upholstery or fabric glue, if needed. - Add a layer of batting over the foam padding and trim any excess material. 6. Attach the new upholstery fabric to the seat cushion: - With the seat cushion facing down, center the fabric on top of the padding and cushion. - Begin by pulling one edge of the fabric tightly over the side of the seat cushion, ensuring that there are no wrinkles or creases in the fabric. - Using a staple gun or upholstery tacks, secure the fabric to the bottom of the seat cushion. Continue this process, working your way around all sides and corners, always ensuring that the fabric remains taut and smooth. - Remember to leave an opening for the screws or bolts that fasten the cushion to the chair frame. 7. Reattach the seat cushion to the chair frame: - Once the fabric has been attached to the seat cushion, align it with the chair frame by inserting the screws or bolts in the designated holes. - Tighten the screws or bolts using a screwdriver or Allen wrench to secure the reupholstered seat cushion firmly in place. 8. Inspect and clean: - Carefully inspect the chair to make sure the fabric is smooth, secure, and well-fitted. Trim excess fabric or batting, if necessary. - Wipe down the chair's frame to remove any dirt or dust and ensure it is clean. Now you have successfully reupholstered a dining room chair, giving it a fresh look and added comfort. Once you have completed one chair, you can use the same process to reupholster the remaining chairs in your dining set, making sure to maintain consistency in appearance and quality throughout."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that completed Hope relatively quickly? is inside the article: Hope is traditionally considered by Christians as a theological virtue (a virtue associated with the grace of God, rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless. In late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that..., can you guess it ?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, it is not possible to specifically identify the name of the person who completed Hope relatively quickly.

The time and money that doctors spend on their medical education is probably one reason for this problem. A visit to a doctor's office costs from 15 to 50 dollars. It's so expensive. Many people in the United States think that doctors are overpaid. However, most doctors disagree. They say that they were asked to study medicine for a long time. Tuition for many years of medical education costs a lot of money. Doctors say that it is necessary for most medical students to borrow money from the bank to pay their tuition. Because their money must be repaid to the bank, young doctors need to receive a lot of money for their work. So they charge people high prices for medical care. Therefore the cost of medical care in America is high. Because high tuition is one cause of high costs, one way to lower costs would be to have medical school that are free or have low tuition.

Flowing water causes sediment to move. Flowing water can erode both rocks and soil. You have already learned that materials can dissolve in water. With enough time, even rocks can be dissolved by water. This process happens really slowly. It may take over a million years to dissolve a rock. It doesnt matter how big the rock is. With enough time, flowing water can dissolve it. Moving water also has the ability to move small pieces of rock and soil. How can water move a rock? Doesnt it need energy? Of course, water gets its energy because it is moving. Moving water has kinetic energy. Things that have more energy can do more work. When water stops moving it will have no energy. It will no longer be able to move the rock and soil. When this happens the rock and soil will settle to the bottom of the calm water. Scientists call this process deposition. Question: \\"Would deposition of or the moving of a particular rock take more energy?\\" Response: \\"The moving of a rock would take more energy than the deposition of that rock\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. According to the principles of physics, moving an object, in this case a rock, requires energy. This energy is used to overcome the forces of friction and gravity. In the context of flowing water, the kinetic energy of the water is transferred to the rock, causing it to move. As the question implies, deposition is the process where sediment, soil, and rocks are laid down in a new location. This typically happens when the motion of the water slows down, or comes to a stop, and it no longer has the energy to carry the sediment or rock. Therefore, it requires less energy as the water is no longer doing the work of moving the rock. Instead, the rock or sediment simply settles due to the force of gravity. The energy required for each process can also depend on other factors like the size and shape of the rock, the steepness of the slope through which the water is flowing, and the velocity of the water. However, generally speaking, it requires more energy to move a rock than to deposit it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Readers Ask About Apple’s New iPhone and Watch After Apple unveiled new iPhones and smartwatches last week, we asked readers to send us their questions about the devices. J. D. Biersdorfer and Brian X. Chen answer the queries. Q. How much is the new iPhone going to cost? Do the wireless headphones come with the phone or is a separate payment needed? What colors do they come in again? — Stephanie J. D.: Here is the breakdown for the iPhone 7, without carrier subsidies or trade-up deals factored in: ■ The 32-gigabyte model: 650. ■ The 128-gigabyte model: 750. ■ The 256-gigabyte model (the one with the largest capacity): 850. For the larger iPhone 7 Plus: ■ The 32-gigabyte model: 770. ■ The 128-gigabyte model: 870. ■ The 256-gigabyte model: 970. Apple and most wireless carriers offer monthly payment plans to carve up the cost into smaller cash chunks. Wired earbuds are included in the box, but the wireless AirPods are not part of the package and will cost an additional 160 when they arrive in late October. As for colors, you have your choice of silver, gold, pink (“rose gold”) or flat black for all models. A new glossy ebony shade called “jet black” is also available for both iPhone 7 models in the 128- and 256-gigabyte capacities, but Footnote No. 1 on Apple’s product specifications page warns that the color’s “high shine may show fine microabrasions with use.” It suggests getting a case to protect it — which may defeat the purpose of getting the stylish new color unless you like scratches or clear plastic phone cases. I have an iPhone 6 I purchased in November 2014 with a warranty, which expires in November 2016. Is it worth it for me to purchase an iPhone 7? — Jack Bertolino Brian: Based on speed alone, it is probably worthwhile to upgrade if you currently own an iPhone 6. The iPhone 7 is significantly faster than the iPhone 6. In speed tests conducted with the app Geekbench 4, the iPhone 7 was 114 percent faster than the iPhone 6. Other than that, the iPhone 7 camera is significantly better than the one on the iPhone 6. And when you consider the benefits of the iPhone 7’s being water-and dust-resistant, over all this is a meaningful upgrade if you own an iPhone that is at least two years old. What is the weight difference for the new phones compared to past models? — Burt Herman J. D.: For the iPhone models with the 4.7-inch screen size, Apple’s specifications state the iPhone 6 from two years ago tipped the scales at 4.55 ounces and last year’s iPhone 6s came in at 5.04 ounces — but the iPhone 7 dips back down to 4.87 ounces. In the 5.5-inch screen category, the larger iPhone 6 Plus model has a listed weight of 6.07 ounces and the iPhone 6s Plus is 6.77 ounces, but the iPhone 7 Plus edges down to 6.63 ounces. In comparison, the lightest model currently for sale is the iPhone SE, which was released earlier this year. The iPhone SE, with a smaller four-inch screen, is a comparatively svelte 3.99 ounces. Can other brands of wireless headphones be used with the new 7? Or are you limited to the Apple headphones because of a new type of chip in the device? — Mark Singleton Brian: The iPhone 7 supports the open Bluetooth standard, so third-party wireless headphones will be compatible with it. The proprietary chip you are referring to, called W1, is inside the AirPods, Apple’s new wireless earbuds. The AirPods will work fully only with Apple devices. While non-Apple Bluetooth devices can connect with the AirPods for audio, they would not be able to take advantage of the AirPods’ special auto-pairing feature or Siri. How does the iPhone 7 camera differ from the ones on the iPhone 6 and 6s? — Pat Well J. D.: Far from the measly fixed-focus, two-megapixel camera in 2007’s original iPhone, the iPhone 6 line of 2014 had an eight-megapixel camera with a five-element lens, f/2.2 aperture, a True Tone Flash, face detection and other advanced features; the larger 6 Plus also provided optical image stabilization. The iPhone 6s series bumped up the camera resolution to 12 megapixels and added the animated Live Photos feature and 4K video support — but kept the five-element lens and f/2.2 aperture, while optical image stabilization stayed exclusive to the Plus-size version. However, the iPhone 7 provides optical image stabilization in both the regular and supersize models, and upgrades the hardware to a six-element lens for more colorful photos with greater image detail. The lens also has a larger aperture of f/1.8 and this year’s iPhones have a flash that is 50 percent brighter than the one on last year’s models. Devotion to serious smartphone photography is where the iPhone 7 line diverges, as the bigger iPhone 7 Plus adds a second camera on the back — a 12-megapixel telephoto unit with a f/2.8 aperture, as well as optical and digital zoom. To get professional-quality portraits, the 7 Plus uses the two cameras together to show the picture’s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background. For those concerned with the selfie quality in their Instagram feeds, the resolution on the front FaceTime camera has taken a huge leap since the 1.2-megapixel version on the iPhone 6, and even the five-megapixel front camera on last year’s iPhone 6s. The iPhone 7 now tops the line with a seven-megapixel camera staring you in the face. When you are in an app and you accidentally touch the iPhone’s new home button, as it is touch-sensitive now, will the app close out? — Amanda Brian: No, the app will not close out. The virtual home button is not just touch-sensitive; it is force-sensitive, meaning it can detect how hard you press. In other words, you have to press down on the button to return to the home screen; when you do, the home button will vibrate in response. How do you charge the new AirPods? — John Steel J. D.: The new wireless earbuds will come with a special portable case that both stores and charges the headphones; numerous people have already described it as looking like a large dental floss dispenser. The AirPods themselves are supposed to get about five hours of use per full charge — or a minimum of three charging sessions to get through all four operas in Richard Wagner’s epic “Ring\\" cycle. When the juice runs out, you put the AirPods in the little white charging case to power up again. Apple estimates 15 minutes in the case should get the AirPods about three hours of listening time or at least an hour of talk time, as the earbuds also include microphones for phone calls or Siri commands. The special charging case needs its own power refill after about 24 hours of listening time. So before long trips, remember to charge the charging case as you charge the AirPods so the music doesn’t die while you are in transit. Can the AirPods be used with older phones? — Curtis Bale Brian: Older iPhones capable of running the new operating system, iOS 10, will be compatible with the AirPods. Apple’s website says that iPhones all the way back to the four-year-old iPhone 5 can run iOS 10. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The new iPhone 7 models range from 650 for the 32GB model to 970 for the 256GB iPhone 7 Plus, with wireless AirPods costing an additional 160. The iPhone 7 is faster, has an upgraded camera, and supports the open Bluetooth standard, meaning third-party wireless headphones can be used with it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It would take me 45 minutes to get to a Medical facility. An ambulance takes 14 minutes to get to my house and 45 minutes to get to a hospital. Now I can say that I have feed babies things that are not recommended at their age. For example, If a baby is not getting full feeling off of just formula, I would make rice cereal and feed the baby that. Some babies are just to big to be satisfied on just milk. Rice is a good filler and does No harm. (like I would not use wheat cereal) I also would give a baby warm tea when they had a stomach ache. Tea of course has caffeine in it.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

According to the premise, two men are from law enforcement, and they are wearing white cowboy hats—not beanies—while riding in a cart past a red car. This information is significantly different from the hypothesis, which assumes the two men are wearing beanies. Moreover, the premise provides explicit details about their attire (cowboy hats) and their profession (law enforcement), which are not mirrored in the hypothesis (beanies without any mention of the profession). These are two discrete situations, and, therefore, one cannot be concluded from the other. Furthermore, the prominence of cowboy hats in the premise might suggest a specific cultural or regional setting. Cowboy hats are often associated with the American West, law enforcement in small towns, or distinct local customs.

The paragraph focuses on the events that took place in 1990 when a vast coalition was assembled to remove Saddam Hussein and his forces from Kuwait.

The paragraph also mentions a vote that took place in the Senate to authorize the use of force, which the speaker's opponent voted against. The paragraph does not provide any information about Saddam Hussein's feelings or intentions towards Kuwait or its people. Rather, it emphasizes the actions and reactions of the international community and the political decisions made in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait under Saddam Hussein's rule. Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 was driven by reasons such as Kuwait's alleged overproduction of oil which led to a reduction in oil prices, Iraq's financial difficulties after the Iran-Iraq war, and territorial disputes between the two nations among other factors.

They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm.

He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fork would have lower frequency of the vibrations, fork A or fork B? Hint: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure below (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them.) The answer is:","completion":"Fork B would have the lower frequency of vibrations. According to the provided information, John produced a higher frequency with fork A and a lower frequency with fork B. Both frequencies had the same amplitude, which means the displacement or movement of particles in the medium (air in this case) was the same for both forks. However, fork B produced vibrations at a slower rate (lower frequency) compared to fork A."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The best known work of fiction from the Islamic world is One Thousand and One Nights (In Persian: hezār-o-yek šab > Arabic: ʔalf-layl-at-wa-l’-layla= One thousand Night and (one) Night) or *Arabian Nights, a name invented by early Western translators, which is a compilation of folk tales from Sanskrit, Persian, and later Arabian fables. The original concept is derived from a pre-Islamic Persian prototype Hezār Afsān (Thousand Fables) that relied on particular Indian elements. It reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another. All Arabian fantasy tales tend to be called Arabian Nights stories when translated into English, regardless of whether they appear in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights or not. This work has been very influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by Antoine Galland. Imitations were written, especially in France. Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad the Sailor and Ali Baba.

Take note if someone has a bad track record of destroying property. Keep track of nervous or confused behaviors. Keep track of how often the suspected person misses work. Article:","completion":"Title: Keeping an Eye Out for Unusual Behavior Hey, little friends! Today, we will learn about watching out for unusual behaviors in people. This means we must take care when we see someone acting odd or doing things that are not safe. It's important because it helps us stay safe and maybe even help the person who is acting strangely. First of all, we need to learn what \\"unusual behavior\\" means. It means when a person is doing something that they usually don't do or if they are doing things that most people would not do. For example, if our friend suddenly starts running around in circles or doing dangerous things, then that's unusual behavior. Next, let's learn about some examples of unusual behavior. One example is a person who does risky activities, like climbing high places without using any safety equipment or trying to touch things that they shouldn't, such as hot stoves. If someone does these things, we must be careful and stay away from them to stay safe. Another thing to watch for is if someone has a bad track record of destroying property. This means they might have broken other people's things before, like toys or even windows. If we see someone doing this, we should tell an adult, like a parent or a teacher, so they can help. Now let's talk about \\"nervous\\" or \\"confused\\" behaviors. Sometimes people might look like they are not sure what they are doing or they might be moving around a lot, like they can't sit still. This can be a sign that they are not feeling good or they might need help. If we see someone like this, we should also tell an adult so they can check on the person. Lastly, we must keep track of how often a person is not where they are supposed to be. For example, if our friend is missing school a lot or not coming to play when they usually do, this might be a sign that something is wrong. By telling an adult, we can help our friend and make sure everything is okay. In conclusion, it is important to keep an eye on people who are acting in an unusual way. By doing this, we can take care of ourselves and each other. Remember to tell an adult if you see any of these behaviors, so they can help keep everyone safe and happy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

To elaborate on the two paraphrases: 1. The structural art and the style of this idol is unique and is in perfect proportion to it. In this sentence, the author is conveying that the structural art and style of the idol are unique and that the proportions of the idol are perfect.

The \\"&\\" symbol serves the same purpose as \\"and\\" in connecting the two main ideas. In this version, \\"it\\" refers back to the idol, emphasizing its unique structural art and style, as well as the perfect proportion that characterizes the idol. The phrase \\"to it\\" is omitted in this paraphrase but doesn't change the overall meaning of the sentence.

In dieser Arbeit (In this work) untersuchten (we analyzed) wir verschiedene (different) modernste (state-of-the art) Methoden (methods) zur Erstellung (for building) visueller Codebücher (visual codebooks). In dieser detaillierten und ausführlichen Antwort erläutern wir die verschiedenen Aspekte der Analyse modernster Methoden zur Erstellung visueller Codebücher. Das Hauptziel dieser Studie war die Untersuchung verschiedener modernster Methoden zur Erstellung visueller Codebücher, um herauszufinden, welche am besten geeignet sind und welche Vorteile und Nachteile sie haben. Visual Codebooks sind eine Art quantitativer Repräsentation von bildbasierten Merkmalen und werden in vielen Computer Vision-Anwendungen verwendet, wie z.B. Bildsuche, Bildklassifizierung und Objekterkennung. Zu Beginn der Analyse wurden unterschiedliche Methoden zur Merkmalsextraktion betrachtet. Merkmalsextraktion ist ein wichtiger Schritt, um visuelle Codebücher erstellen zu können, da sie dazu verwendet werden, die relevanten Informationen aus einem Bild zu extrahieren und in einen geeigneten Vektorraum zu übertragen. Einige bekannte Merkmalsextraktionsmethoden sind SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) und ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF). Nach der Untersuchung der Merkmalsextraktion haben wir uns auf die Analyse und den Vergleich der häufig verwendeten Methoden zur Codebuchgenerierung konzentriert. Eine beliebte Methode zur Erstellung von visuellen Codebüchern ist das k-Means-Clustering. k-Means-Clustering ist ein iterativer Prozess, bei dem die Merkmalsvektoren so gruppiert werden, dass sie die geringste Distanz zu einem vordefinierten Zentrum haben. Hierbei wird eine Gruppe von Clusterzentren, auch bekannt als Visual Words, trainiert und verwendet, um die einzelnen Features nach Typ und Häufigkeit zu klassifizieren. Eine weitere untersuchte Methode war der Einsatz von Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) zur Erstellung von visuellen Codebüchern. GMM ist eine statistische Modellierungsmethode, bei der versucht wird, eine Wahrscheinlichkeitsdichtefunktion mit Hilfe von mehreren Gaußverteilungen abzuschätzen. Durch das Anpassen von Mischungsmodellen kann eine größere Flexibilität erreicht werden, um die Verteilung der Datenpunkte genauer zu modellieren. Nach der Analyse dieser verschiedenen Ansätze zur Erstellung visueller Codebücher haben wir ihre Stärken und Schwächen im Hinblick auf verschiedene Anwendungsgebiete betrachtet. Wir haben auch die Effizienz, die Robustheit gegenüber Veränderungen in der Bildgebung und die Fähigkeit zur Anpassung an neue Datensätze und Anwendungsfälle diskutiert. Zusammenfassend haben wir in dieser Arbeit verschiedene modernste Ansätze zur Erstellung visueller Codebücher analysiert und bewertet, um ihre Eignung für verschiedene Anwendungen im Bereich Computer Vision zu beurteilen. Dank dieser Untersuchung können Forscher und Ingenieure besser entscheiden, welche Methode zur Erstellung von visuellen Codebüchern für ihre spezifischen Anwendungsfälle am besten geeignet ist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: People should be warned against using mobile phones outdoors in stormy weather because they may\\"be struck by lightning\\",according to doctors. Three experts have described how a teenage girl was struck by lightning while using her phone in a large London park.The girl,aged 15,recovered,but a year later was still wheelchair-bound and found to be suffering complex physical and emotional problems. The girl also had a perforate eardrum on the side where she had been holding the mobile phone.She was having general recovery in Northwick Park Hospital,Middlesex. Swinda Esprit,a senior house officer, said that while the brain and muscle damage was similar to that of many lightning victims--who can experience heart attacks on being struck--the ear problems were not. She said that the damages were particularly relevant for people who might be involved in less serious lightning incidents,who might otherwise recover, but would never get their full hearing back if struck while on the phone. \\"We were shocked by the damage,which is why we wanted to draw attention to it,\\"Dr Esprit said.\\"A year on and she still was suffering these difficult hearing.\\" They added that three other cases had been reported in newspapers in China,South Korea,and Malaysia.In the Malaysian case,a sales executive was killed by lightning while talking on his phone during a thunderstorm near Kuala Lumpur. \\"All these events resulted in death,\\"the doctors wrote.\\"This rare phenomenon is a public health issue,and education is necessary to stress the risk.\\" The Australian Lightning Protection Standard recommends that metallic objects,including cordless or mobile phones,should not be carried outdoors during thunderstorms.However, \\"the United States National Weather Service says on its website that both are safe to use \\"because there is no direct path between you and the lightening\\".

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: In what region are basalt and andesite the most common rock types? , can you please find it? Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

Her performance in general is fairly good, but test scores are very low. She has held many leadership and volunteer positions. We have been advised to have her write an essay about how her learning disability is a barrier that she has to get over. Will that help or hurt her chances for admission? ---- Deborah A: First let me answer the question on low standardized test scores (ACT/SAT). There are hundreds of colleges that are \\"test optional\\" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found at fairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted. Please know that colleges do not deny admission based on disability. \\"Disclosing\\" a learning disability in a personal statement within the college application can certainly help. By writing a personal statement, students can potentially _ , for example, their understanding of the challenge they face. They might also prove an improved grade trend in that subject area, and show interest in more complex courses in spite of this disability. More importantly, a student disclosure can show self-confidence, motivation and an understanding of the disability. ---- Ms. Kravis Question: What do we know about Deborah's daughter?

I was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid. The characters were engaging and I like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her dying. Most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian longs for their niece Chuck and Emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are picture perfect and believable. I like how Emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. All in all, this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that I've seen out of the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. I just wish the writers would get back to work, so that the show can continue to evolve.","completion":"This review has a positive sentiment.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: A low-glycemic diet can help reduce inflammation, which may contribute to your acne. While eating greasy food won't cause acne, eating fresh fruits and vegetables containing lots vitamin A can improve your complexion. Some foods that are high in vitamin A include sweet potatoes, carrots, dark leafy greens, dried apricots, melons, and tuna. These make your blood sugar spike which triggers insulin production. Insulin production also leads to oil production which can clog up your pores. While stress itself does not actually cause acne, it can lead to a more noticeable breakout. Find relaxing things to do on a regular basis. Meditation, exercise, reading, or learning a new skill are great things to add to your schedule and might keep the breakouts at bay. Stressing about acne can make it even worse. Not only will your mental state aggravate acne, but getting too aggressive about treating acne (such as scrubbing, harsh chemicals, or too frequent washing) can also aggravate the problem. Typically, you are the only person who notices your own acne. Other people will usually not scrutinize your skin as closely as you do. Use your acne regimen as an opportunity to relax and take care of yourself. The actions of washing the face, drying the face, and smoothing on moisturizer all massage and can help you feel good. It can be a calming ritual in your day. Slow down and enjoy. An approach like this can help you relax, feel good about taking care of your skin, and make you feel better about yourself. A typical acne breakout will generally resolve itself within a few days, even if untreated. If you take on a new sport or like to exercise, be sure to wear loose fitting clothing so that your skin doesn't come into prolonged contact with sweat. Also, shower immediately after so that the oil and bacteria doesn't sit on your skin. Summary:","completion":"A low-glycemic diet with lots of vitamin A can help make your skin better and less acne.

Article: Japanese sailor Kenichi Horie has finished a 110-day solo voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a boat pushed by sea waves to win another world first. Weak waves and ocean water movements made his arrival late, which was going to be in late May. \\"When waves were weak, the boat slowed down. That's a problem that needs to be solved,\\" the adventure told reporters from his boat in western Japan. His 9.5-meter-long boat can move like a dolphin's tail, and it rises or falls with the waves. Horie reached his destination in the channel between the main Japanese islands just before midnight after covering about 7,000 kilometers from Hawaii. Horie first made world record in 1962 when, at the age of 23, he became the first person to sail alone across the Pacific. He made the three-month voyage from his hometown in spite of breaking Japanese law, which did not allow his citizens to sail on their own out of the country, and without a passport or money. He was arrested upon arrival in San Francisco but the city mayor freed him, gave him a 30-day visa and made him an honorary citizen. News of his achievement made him a hero back home in Japan and his book of the voyage In the Pacific was made into a film. Since then, he has completed many sailing trips across the Pacific and around the world. After his latest adventure with an environmentally friendly theme, Horie planned to return to his hometown on Sunday. He said, \\"Throughout history, mankind has used wind for power, but no one has appeared to be serious about wave power.\\" Horie told the reporter, \\"I think I'm a lucky boy as this wave power system has remained untouched in fact.\\" Question: The author wrote the article mainly to _ .

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a news article: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said Thursday that the issue of sexual assault on Capitol Hill is a pervasive one that needs to be changed. \\"What we have right now is a process that's opaque, difficult to navigate and most survivors don't even know where to report,\\" said Sen. Gillibrand on \\"CBS This Morning.\\" Gillibrand and Rep. Jackie Speier, D-California, introduced the \\"Me Too Congress Act\\" on the Hill on Wednesday in response to growing concerns of sexual misconduct at the nation's capitol. She says the bill will make the reporting process \\"transparent, make it more accountable and we'll actually have a survey so that way every person who works here can fill out a climate survey of whether they feel safe or not.\\" The bill would also eliminate mandatory non-disclosure agreements on behalf of an assault survivor, makes mediation and counseling optional and requires members of Congress to repay any discrimination settlements. She says similar legislation proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, however, is not strong enough. \\"I don't know what his bill will say, but it's more than just having training, he said he wants to do training, that's not enough, we need training, number one, but we also need to change the process so that it's possible for someone to get justice today,\\" Gillibrand said. She added, \\"if you have someone harassing you at your office you'll have to go through a mediation process for months before you can even make your case, that's not something that's conducive to someone reporting or ending harassment in the workplace.\\" Gillibrand said that while Speier alluded to two current members of Congress, one Democrat and one Republican, being accused of harassing women, she said it's up to the survivors to name the lawmakers. \\"A survivor might not want to have to be in the middle of a story for the next number of months, she might want to continue with her career, she might not want to be discriminated against or somehow retaliated against,\\" the senator said. She added, \\"the way I wrote my bill is to make sure the survivor has choice whether or not she wants to take issue public or he, because right now, they don't have that option, they have to actually sign an agreement not to disclose what happened to them.\\" Gillibrand spoke as more allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced against Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. While more lawmakers continue to pull their support from Moore, including many Republican leaders calling for him to step aside, Gillibrand said if Moore was elected to the senate, she'd vote against him being seated. Asked about a potential write-in campaign for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to take back his vacant seat which Moore is running for, Gillibrand said while there's a \\"great candidate who's running on the Democratic line who I support\\", if she had to choose a Republican candidate, she'd pick Luther Strange. ||||| Earlier, she said she would give all the donations her campaign had received from Mr. Franken’s political action committee to Protect Our Defenders, which helps those assaulted in the military. She also introduced the “Me Too Congress Act” on Thursday to address yearslong and rampant sexual misconduct on Capitol Hill. Ms. Gillibrand began a new push this week for legislation to authorize military prosecutors, rather than commanders, to decide which sexual assault cases should be brought to court, with the aim of encouraging more people to report crimes without fear of retaliation. She was an early supporter of Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and has spent countless hours raising money for Democratic women who run for office, citing Mrs. Clinton as a role model. “In my adult life, politically, no one has inspired me to get off the sidelines and truly make a difference more than Hillary Clinton has,” Ms. Gillibrand said last year in an essay on why she was supporting Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Gillibrand has also noted Mr. Clinton’s support for her own run for office. “I was lucky enough to receive guidance and mentorship from Hillary during that run, and was truly honored that President Bill Clinton campaigned for me in my first run for Congress in 2006,” she wrote in the same essay. Her criticism of the former president’s affair with Monica S. Lewinsky between 1995 and 1997 comes as the nation grapples with charges of sexual misconduct and harassment by celebrities, politicians and journalists that have often involved men exerting their professional power over younger women. Roy S. Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, and lawmakers have testified that sexual harassers remain in their ranks. The rise of sexual harassment complaints across a broad array of fields has also caused a re-examination of Mr. Clinton’s role. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, is vocally addressing the issue of sexual assault and harassment within the halls of the U.S. Capitol. In an appearance on \\"CBS This Morning,\\" she described the current system for reporting such incidents as \\"opaque\\" and \\"difficult to navigate.\\" To expose the true extent of the issue and provide better support for victims, Gillibrand and Rep. Jackie Speier of California have introduced the \\"Me Too Congress Act.\\" This bill is designed to make the reporting process more transparent and accountable, allowing employees of Congress to complete a survey regarding workplace safety and eliminating mandatory non-disclosure agreements for survivors of sexual assault. Importantly, the proposed legislation also stipulates that members of Congress are required to repay any settlements related to discrimination cases. It also gives victims a choice whether or not to make their incident public, an option that is currently denied to them due to required non-disclosure agreements. She described House Speaker Paul Ryan's alternative bill as 'not strong enough,' as it focuses only on providing training. Gillibrand argues that systematic alterations must be made to enable justice for the victims. Gillibrand maintains that the decision to publicly reveal the names of the accused should remain the prerogative of the survivors. She acknowledged the potential retaliation and personal turmoil that public attention could inflict upon survivors, especially those working within politics. Amid the backdrop of her activism against sexual misconduct, Gillibrand has also been vociferous in her critique of Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has faced a slew of sexual misconduct allegations. She avowed that if Moore were elected, she would vote against his seating. In addition to her work in Congress, Gillibrand has been active in pushing legislation outside Capitol Hill. She is lobbying for military prosecutors to have the authority to decide which sexual assault cases are trialed, thus encouraging more individuals to report crimes without fearing backlash. Gillibrand's actions against sexual misconduct are part of an overall commitment to supporting fellow women in politics. For instance, she was an early advocate for Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential campaign, dedicating numerous hours to fundraising for Democratic women candidates. This stand against sexual harassment and misconduct aligns with a broader societal shift. High-profile individuals across multiple sectors, including media, entertainment, and politics, face allegations of misconduct, sparking a significant reevaluation of workplace dynamics and power disparities. Notably, even former President Bill Clinton's behavior during the Monica Lewinsky scandal is being questioned in light of these recent developments.

Input: Paragraph: The study, which underscored the importance of social distancing to fight the coronavirus outbreak, looked at 243 cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, reported in Singapore between January 23 and March 16. It identified seven “clusters” where pre-symptomatic transmission was likely, and in four such groups, where the date of exposure could be determined, pre-symptomatic transmission occurred one-to-three days before symptoms appeared in the source patient. Of the cases in Singapore, 157 were locally acquired and 10 of these were likely transmitted before symptoms started to show. The fast-spreading virus has claimed over 43,000 lives globally, with nearly 4,000 in the United States. The findings suggest that it might not be enough for people showing symptoms to limit their contact to control the pandemic, the researchers wrote in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published online on Wednesday. The findings increase the challenges of containment measures, the researchers wrote, but said the magnitude of the impact depends on the extent and duration of transmissibility while a patient is pre-symptomatic and that has so far not been clearly established. The study authors suggested that public health officials conducting contact tracing should strongly consider including a period before symptom onset to account for the possibility of this type of transmission. Transmissions might take place through respiratory droplets or even speech and other vocal activities such as singing, with the rate of emission corresponding to voice loudness, according to the researchers. While the cases were carefully investigated, the CDC said it was possible an unknown source might have caused the clusters. And, the findings could also be affected by incorrect reporting of cases, especially if people had only mild symptoms. With the focus currently on testing only people who show symptoms, the researchers expect asymptomatic illness to be under-detected. Still, the CDC data adds to previous reports of individual cases in China that indicated the virus could spread before symptoms start to appear. Claim: Coronavirus can spread one to three days before symptoms appear: CDC study. Output:","completion":"The CDC study analyzed 243 cases of COVID-19 in Singapore, identifying seven “clusters” where pre-symptomatic transmission was likely.

Black hair is essential for a classic goth look, but there are other options available depending on your specific tastes. If you're into steampunk, a light brown or blonde can work well. For cybergoths, fluorescent greens and neon pinks will stand out nicely. You can choose to not dye your hair at all if you'd like—especially if it's already a shade of dark brown or black. If you can't dye your hair because of your job, school, or parents, consider getting a temporary dye for the important nights out with your friends. Hair chalk, spray color, and Kool Aid are some easy ways to dye your hair temporarily. in the front, sides, and back for a classic emo-goth look. For the standard look, use a flat iron to straighten your hair in the front. Comb it at a 45-55 degree angle to the side so that it hangs over a portion of one of your eyebrows. Flatten the sides and comb them out or down depending on your preference. In the back, you can use hair gel to spike it out or comb it down to match the rest of your hair. Go to a salon and ask for a classic emo-goth look if you don't want to do it yourself. Once you describe it, they'll know exactly what you're looking for. The standard goth cut is most commonly found in the emo goth scene. It's rare that you see a Romantic goth with this style of haircut. For a longer style, grow your hair out past your shoulders. Then, you can either tie it back into a ponytail, or use a flat iron to flatten it. To flatten it, hold out a length of hair from the roots with your nondominant hand. Heat your flat iron and clamp it around a section of hair before slowly sliding it down towards the end of your hair. Repeat this for each section of your hair to make it hang flat. It may take a year or more to grow your hair out long enough. As you're waiting for it to grow to an appropriate length, experiment with other hair styles. This is a common hair style for Romantic and vampire goths. If you want a more radical option, you can spike your hair out with hair gel. To do this, scoop out some gel with both hands and run them outwards through your hair. You can then choose to join segments of hair by twisting them with your palm. You can also shave the sides of your head and spike the section of the middle to create an awesome Mohawk. If you're worried about sticking out too often with a Mohawk, you can always smooth it back with a comb and some hair gel for a more mainstream, trendy cut. If you're trying to go with a casual look that sends the message that you don't really care about your hair, ruffle it with your hands by rubbing your head in multiple directions.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he's not too upset when she's kidnapped. The film is gritty then, showing the lengths to which a young, street-smart girl had to go to survive in that society. The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context. In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of resentment from Wang at not having achieved more material success. Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status, though, that I did, too. While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it's completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage. And after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her, her fierce attachment to Wang makes perfect sense. The peek at small-town life in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two lead actors, the surprising plot twists, and of course, the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.

The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river.

Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

Read Factor a Number for more instructions. For example, if you want to know many divisors, or factors, the number 24 has, write 24{displaystyle 24} at the top of the page. These are two divisors, or factors, of the number. Draw a split branch coming down from the original number, and write the two factors below it. For example, 12 and 2 are factors of 24, so draw a split branch coming down from 24{displaystyle 24}, and write the numbers 12{displaystyle 12} and 2{displaystyle 2} below it. A prime factor is a number that is only evenly divisible by 1 and itself. For example, 7 is a prime number, because the only numbers that evenly divide into 7 are 1 and 7. Circle any prime factors so that you can keep track of them. For example, 2 is a prime number, so you would circle the 2{displaystyle 2} on your factor tree. Keep drawing branches down from the non-prime factors until all of your factors are prime. Circle the prime numbers to keep track of them. For example, 12 can be factored into 6{displaystyle 6} and 2{displaystyle 2}. Since 2{displaystyle 2} is a prime number, you would circle it. Next, 6{displaystyle 6} can be factored into 3{displaystyle 3} and 2{displaystyle 2}. Since 3{displaystyle 3} and 2{displaystyle 2} are prime numbers, you would circle them. To do this, look for multiples of each prime factor in your factor tree. The number of times the factor appears equals the exponent of the factor in your exponential expression. For example, the prime factor 2{displaystyle 2} appears three times in your factor tree, so the exponential expression is 23{displaystyle 2^{3}}. The prime factor 3{displaystyle 3} appears 1 time in your factor tree, so the exponential expression is 31{displaystyle 3^{1}}.

With the international community's focus on energy costs and sustainability, these investors understand the significant impact that OPEC's actions can have on market trends and investment opportunities. As an influential cartel consisting of 13 oil-rich nations, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Nigeria, OPEC has a long history of shaping the global oil landscape through production and pricing agreements. In recent years, the petroleum industry has faced numerous challenges, ranging from global economic shifts to environmental concerns regarding traditional fossil fuels. As a result, investors have been seeking opportunities to diversify their portfolios and find innovative ways to adapt to market fluctuations. London's financial sector, being a major center for investment activity, is particularly interested in OPEC's next move and potential investment opportunities that may arise from it. London investors primarily expect OPEC to address the lingering issue of oil supply and demand, which has affected prices and overall market stability. In this context, two significant factors that are currently weighing on investors' minds include the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging focus on renewable energy and climate change. These considerations may influence OPEC's decisions on production quotas and pricing schemes, thereby determining how the global oil market reacts in the short and long term. Firstly, as COVID-19 restrictions ease and vaccinations become more widespread, investors expect demand for oil to rise over the coming months. However, there is still considerable uncertainty around the pace and extent of this recovery, making investors eager to gauge OPEC's stance on this matter. Consequently, London investors are closely watching for potential signals of an increase or decrease in oil production levels. These production adjustments by OPEC member countries will not only affect oil prices but also shape investor strategies to leverage any arising opportunities. Secondly, investors are increasingly recognizing the urgent need to address climate change, as well as the burgeoning renewable energy sector. As the momentum for renewable energy and sustainable practices continues to build, London investors anticipate that OPEC member countries will also need to adapt. This could involve diversifying their economies, investing in renewable energy, or aligning themselves with international environmental goals. The response of OPEC to these changing dynamics in the global energy market will have a direct bearing on investment decisions in London and elsewhere. In summary, London investors are keeping a close eye on OPEC's decisions and actions in the upcoming week, as these events will significantly influence the global oil market. By addressing the issues of oil supply and demand, as well as responding to the growing focus on renewable energy and sustainability, OPEC will shape not only the direction of the petroleum industry but also the investment strategies of London's financial sector. As the world's attention turns to OPEC next week, investors across the globe will be keenly observing the implications of the organization's actions and incorporating them into their future investment plans."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Nemaja Matic’s red card against Burnley on Saturday comes as a severe blow for Jose Mourinho’s Capital One Cup final plans. The 26-year-old midfielder was sent off for pushing Burnley player forward Ashley Barnes following an awful challenge on the Serbian during the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge. Barnes mistimed his challenge, catching Matic with his studs, but it was missed by referee Martin Atkinson who did not even give a free kick to the title challengers. Ashley Barnes chops down Nemanja Matic during the 1-1 draw between Chelsea and Burnley on Saturday Unsurprisingly Matic sees red and pushed the Burnley player to the ground out of anger on Saturday Having","completion":"already secured a place in the Capital One Cup final against rival club Tottenham Hotspur, Mourinho will now need to make adjustments to his starting lineup in the absence of Matic. The talented defensive midfielder had been an integral part of Chelsea's success this season, offering both stability and strength at the center of the pitch. His role in protecting the backline and preventing the opposition from playing through the midfield cannot be overstated. With Matic unable to participate in the final, Mourinho will need to find a suitable replacement that can effectively fill the void left by the suspended star. One possible solution to the problem would be to utilize the versatile Brazilian midfielder Ramires in Matic's place. Although not a natural holding midfielder like Matic, Ramires' energy and work rate could help disrupt Tottenham's attacking play and provide cover for the defense. Additionally, Ramires offers a strong presence in both the offense and defense, which could soften the impact of missing a key player like Matic. Another option for slotting into the midfield role would be John Obi Mikel, a player who has experience in playing as a defensive midfielder. The Nigerian international might not possess the same level of physicality and aggression as Matic, but he does bring a sense of calmness and positional awareness to the team. Furthermore, Mikel's experience in high-stakes matches might prove invaluable in a cup final, as he already boasts an impressive trophy collection. In selecting either of these potential replacements, Mourinho may also need to adjust the tactical setup of his team to ensure a smooth transition. Depending on which player he chooses, the Portuguese manager might opt for a more cautious approach that focuses on team defense and counterattacks to exploit Tottenham's weaknesses. This would enable Chelsea to maintain control of the game without overexposing the defense and relying too heavily on the replacement midfielder. Regardless of the specific personnel changes, Mourinho must strive to instill a sense of confidence and determination within his squad. The loss of Matic is undoubtedly a significant blow to Chelsea's chances in the Capital One Cup final, but it is crucial for the team to remain focused on the task at hand. By drawing upon the collective strength and talent of his players, Mourinho can still lead Chelsea to victory despite the adversity they face. In conclusion, Nemaja Matic's red card poses a major challenge for Jose Mourinho's Capital One Cup final plans, but it also presents an opportunity for other players to step up and serve the team in a crucial moment. Whether choosing to deploy Ramires or John Obi Mikel in Matic's absence, it is vital for Mourinho to adapt his tactical approach to best suit the strengths of his personnel. Ultimately, the key to overcoming this setback will lie in the team's ability to unite and perform at their highest level under Mourinho's guidance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Comb her hair. Make a basic braid. Be gentle. Build on the mood. Wind it down.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Art of Relaxation through Hair Braiding Introduction In today's fast-paced world, it is important for individuals to find moments of relaxation that help to alleviate stress and create a sense of inner peace. One such method that combines mindfulness, creativity, and human connection is the simple, yet powerful, practice of hair braiding. This article delves into the aspects of hair braiding as a form of relaxation, with a focus on basic braids, and how this practice builds on the mood and winds down at the end. Step 1: Comb Her Hair Begin by laying out all the necessary tools: a comb, a hairbrush, and a hairband. Sit the individual down and gently run your fingers through their hair, ensuring that there are no tangles. If required, use a detangling spray to ease the process. Comb the hair slowly and methodically, giving importance to the repetitive motion, which further sets the tone for a calming atmosphere. This step also serves to strengthen the bond between you and the individual, fostering a sense of trust and comfort. Step 2: Make a Basic Braid With the individual's hair now tangle-free, smoothly divide it into three equal sections. Hold the rightmost and leftmost sections in your respective hands, allowing the middle section to rest between these two. Cross the rightmost section over the middle, and then the leftmost section over it. Continue this pattern, ensuring that each crossing is done with the same rhythm and tension. This consistency not only creates a visually appealing braid but also emits a soothing ambiance. Step 3: Be Gentle Throughout the entire process, it is important to maintain a gentle touch. Hair braiding should not be an uncomfortable experience, and being gentle ensures that the individual feels at ease. Pay attention to the tightness of the braid and the individual's reactions, adjusting as necessary. In doing so, the feeling of tranquility is increased, as the individual can sit back and enjoy the pampering experience. Step 4: Build on the Mood While braiding, take the opportunity to engage in gentle conversation or even share stories. By doing this, you can further enhance the relaxing atmosphere and create a comforting space for the individual. Alternatively, soft background music or nature sounds can also be played to elevate the experience. By engaging the individual and pairing the braiding with a calm environment, you further contribute to the sense of serenity and relaxation. Step 5: Wind It Down As you approach the end of the braid, maintain the same rhythm and tension until the very last strand has been incorporated. Secure the braid with a hairband, and then gently comb your fingers through the loose ends, offering a final touch of soothing care. To conclude the session, offer a moment of silent gratitude to the experience and your connection with the individual. This simple gesture ensures that both parties leave the session feeling refreshed and renewed. Conclusion Hair braiding is more than just a creative hairstyle; it is an opportunity for relaxation, reflection, and human connection. By following these steps and embracing gentleness, braid enthusiasts can create a wonderful atmosphere that fosters a deep sense of tranquility for both the braider and the individual. So, the next time you feel like finding solace in the midst of a hectic schedule, consider practicing the artful and soothing craft of hair braiding."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Thenceforth, little by little, it was discredited. The event referred to in the sentence is the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, which marked the formal end of World War I. However, the term \\"Versailles Diktat\\" is used here, reflecting the perspective that the terms of the treaty were imposed upon the defeated Central Powers, particularly Germany, rather than agreed upon. The sentiments expressed in the sentence suggest a view that the Treaty of Versailles was \\"harsh and dishonourable\\". This view is understandable given the extensive demands made of Germany in the treaty, including the surrender of territory, limitations on its armed forces, and heavy reparations to be paid to the victorious Allies. Moreover, the sentence mentions that the American Senate refused to recognize or adopt the Treaty, which is a reference to the Senate's rejection of the Treaty in November 1919. Despite the involvement of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in the crafting of the Treaty and his advocacy for the League of Nations, political opposition within the Senate led to a failure to ratify the Treaty, leading the U.S. to sign separate peace treaties with Germany, Austria, and Hungary in the 1920s. Finally, the phrase \\"thenceforth, little by little, it was discredited\\" infers that over time, the Treaty of Versailles lost its legitimacy. This may be seen in the emergence of widespread criticism of the Treaty due to its perceived failure to promote lasting peace and stability in Europe, and the manner in which it fuelled resentment and animosity, particularly in Germany, laying the groundwork for the rise of Adolf Hitler and the events of World War II."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: CONTEXT: 9 de enero de 2008 La senadora por Nueva York Hillary Clinton ganó la elección primaria demócrata en Nueva Hampshire, mientras que el senador por Arizona John McCain emergió como el triunfador entre los republicanos. La estrecha victoria de Clinton, el martes, tuvo lugar una semana después que terminara en tercer lugar en las asambleas partidarias de Iowa, muy detrás del senador por Illinois Barak Obama. En su discurso de victoria, la senadora por Nueva York y ex primera dama dijo que está lista para darle a Estados Unidos la clase de resurgimiento que Nueva Hampshire le acaba de dar a ella. Obama, quien terminó en un cercano segundo lugar, felicitó a Clinton y proclamó que su campaña continuará para representar a millones de voces que piden el cambio. Obama tenía una ventaja de doble dígito en las encuestas de opinión previas a la votación. McCain, cuya campaña casi colapsó el año pasado, superó a su más cercano rival republicano, el ex gobernador de Massachussets Mitt Romney. McCain dijo a sus seguidores que habían mostrado a la nación cómo luce un resurgimiento y sugirió que harán historia. Mike Huckabee, quien ganó las asambleas partidarias de Iowa, la semana pasada, quedó en un distante tercer lugar, en Nueva Hampshire.

When we were kids, we dreaded accompanying her to Wal-Mart, or worse, the Cosco at the edge of town, where the echoing rafters and limitless aisles seemed to mock the confusion into which we were inevitably thrown when handed torn-off fragments of the list.

Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.

Is it true that in early 19th century new orleans where was real african music heard in the community based on the following text? The African influence on New Orleans music can trace its roots at least back to Congo Square in New Orleans in 1835, when slaves would congregate there to play music and dance on Sundays. African music was played as well as local music, including that of local white composers, such as Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Along with European musical forms that were popular in the city, including the brass band traditions, the cultural mix laid the groundwork for the New Orleans musical art forms to come.","completion":"Based on the text provided, it is indeed true that real African music was heard in the community of early 19th century New Orleans. The African influence on the city's music can be traced back to at least 1835 at Congo Square, a location where slaves would congregate on Sundays to play music and dance. This gathering allowed for the preservation and sharing of African musical traditions within the community, as well as their integration with other local musical styles and influences. The text also refers to the music of local white composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk. This inclusion shows that New Orleans' unique cultural blend incorporated elements from a variety of sources, including European musical traditions, such as the popular brass band. It is important to note that while European music played a role in shaping New Orleans' diverse musical landscape, the African influence present in Congo Square had a significant impact on the development of the city's distinct musical identity. Over time, the cultural mix and rich exchange of musical knowledge in New Orleans led to the creation of unique art forms that would come to define the city's musical legacy. These included jazz, blues, and other genres that grew from this fertile ground of creative blending. In conclusion, it is accurate to say that the African music played in Congo Square during the early 19th century had a profound effect on the growth of New Orleans' music scene and contributed to the eclectic tapestry of sounds that continue to define the city's vibrant musical heritage to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They kinda look like small webs or tree branches, that's why we call them 'spider veins'. They're not harmful, but some people don't like how they look in their skin. Now, our friend Cynthia has more spider veins on her legs than Emily because she's a bit older. You know how grandma has more wrinkles than mommy? That's because she's older. It's the same way with Cynthia and Emily. As people grow older, their bodies go through changes, and one of these changes can be the appearance of spider veins. You might be wondering why it doesn't happen to everyone. Well, that's because everyone's body is different. Just like some people might need glasses and others don't, some might get spider veins while others won't. But there's also another very important reason why Cynthia has more spider veins than Emily. That's because Cynthia used to stand a lot in her old job. Yes, standing for a long time can lead to spider veins as it puts a lot of pressure on the legs. Emily, on the other hand, had a job where she could sit down more, so her legs didn't have as much pressure. To make it even simpler, think about it like this: Imagine if you were to squeeze a water balloon really, really hard. The more you squeeze it, the more the balloon stretches, right? Well, when Cynthia stood for a long time, it was like she was squeezing her leg veins, causing them to stretch and appear like spider veins.

In the first ODI between the teams since Australia won the World Cup final in March last year, Martin Guptill hit five sixes in his 90 from 76 balls. There were 13 sixes in total as the Black Caps posted 307-8 after being put in at Auckland's Eden Park. Australia, who recently lost a Twenty20 series 3-0 to India, were 41-6 after nine overs and all out for 148. It was a fifth successive limited-overs defeat for the Australians, who also lost the last of a five-match one-day international series with India. They are without coach Darren Lehmann, who will miss the series as he recovers from deep vein thrombosis. New Zealand scored only one run in the opening two overs before skipper Brendon McCullum, in his final appearance at Eden Park before retirement, hit 20 in four balls from Josh Hazlewood. After McCullum fell for 44, Guptill moved to 50 from 47 balls with a six and a four in consecutive deliveries, but was denied an 11th ODI century when he was run out by a direct hit from Glenn Maxwell in the 25th over. In Australia's reply, Black Caps paceman Matt Henry - overlooked for the World Twenty20 - took 3-20 in his first four overs, including the wicket of captain Steve Smith, who was bowled off the inside edge for 18. Trent Boult, meanwhile, took 3-21 in his opening five overs, dismissing Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh in the same over. He also removed key opener David Warner lbw for 12, a decision not reviewed by the Australians though replays showed the ball would have missed the stumps.

After you’ve had some practice comparing decimals, this step will no longer be necessary, but writing out the decimals will force you to pay attention to the numbers. You can write the decimals you’re comparing out in one of several ways including both side by side, vertical, and table. If you’re most comfortable comparing numbers written side-by-side, write the decimals out this way. Most math problems dealing with inequalities are written this way. A side by side decimal comparison would be the following: 0.6 = 0.60 .34 > .10 502.50 < 599.22 2000.00 > .001 You may find it easier to compare decimals by writing each decimal on top of the other, as you would if you were adding them.

I ' m thrilled that it went so well , to say the least . All the shows were packed and lots of fun and we came back with enough money to cover a good chunk of the coming recording expenses . Question: What is causing the narrator some exhaustion ?","completion":"The narrator does not explicitly state that they are feeling exhausted. However, it is plausible to infer that their fatigue could stem from multiple causes associated with their recent four-day trip, which involved travel across several cities and participation in numerous shows. Firstly, the physical exertion associated with traveling from city to city could contribute to the narrator’s exhaustion. Traveling involves a variety of physically demanding activities, such as carrying heavy luggage, walking or rushing through large airports or stations, and spending long hours in potentially uncomfortable seats during flights, train rides, or drives. The stress on the body is amplified further when the travel involves multiple destinations in quick succession, as it disrupts normal restful routines. Additionally, the mental effort required to navigate different cities and maintain a tight, multi-stop travel and performance schedule can lead to cognitive fatigue. Keeping track of details like travel times, hotel check-ins/check-outs, venue locations, and performance times could be mentally draining, apart from coping with the stresses associated with any unplanned travel issues like delays or cancellations. The narrator also mentions that their group performed shows in each city, which implies that they were part of some performing arts, likely a musical band considering the mention of recording expenses. Performances, too, require considerable physical and mental energy, both in terms of the actual performance and the preparatory processes, including rehearsals, set-up and tear-down, interactions with fans, etc. The thrill of performing can often adrenaline-fueled, and the subsequent crash once the excitement subsides can leave one feeling exhausted. Finally, the psychological toll of being away from familiar environments and routines should not be overlooked. The absence of regular sleeping and eating routines, of time to unwind, of familiar faces and places, can all contribute to a sense of tiredness and fatigue. For these reasons, despite the trip's apparent success and enjoyment, it is reasonable to infer that the narrator might be grappling with certain levels of exhaustion in the wake of their journey."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. If you want larger curls, or if you mostly just want to add volume, opt for large rollers, like a 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) diameter. If you’d prefer tighter curls, use small or medium rollers, which typically range from 1⁄4–1⁄2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) in diameter. Rod-shaped curlers are great for creating spiral curls or defining natural curls. They're also perfect for curling short hair, since they tend to have a smaller diameter. If you don’t have rollers, you can cut strips out of an old T-shirt, instead. Make the strips the same width that you want your curls to be, and a little longer than the length of your hair. Foam rollers might get damaged if you put them into wet hair, so make sure to use a roller that’s designed to be used while your hair is damp. Also, look for a soft roller, like one made from rubber, satin, or silicone, if you’re planning to sleep with the rollers in. Wash and condition your hair, or just spritz it with water from a spray bottle. If you’re starting with wet hair, gently blot your hair with a soft towel until it’s damp. The curls will hold better if you start with damp hair, but if it’s too wet, it might not dry completely once you put in the rollers. Do not apply serum or leave-in conditioner to your hair, as the curls may not set. By following a pattern when you’re rolling your hair, you’ll end up with a more symmetrical style, and it will be easier to keep the sections separate. Start by rolling the top section of your hair, or the mohawk area, all the way back to your crown. When you’re finished, you should have a neat row of horizontal rollers all the way along the top of your head. This will give you plenty of volume at your roots. Once you’ve rolled the front section, take another section of hair near one of your ears. This time, hold the hair straight out from your head horizontally, and place the roller vertically at the end of your hair. Roll the hair all the way to your scalp and secure it again, then continue for the hair on both sides of your head. Roll your hair under for curls that curve toward your neck, or roll it up for curls that bounce outward. You can arrange the rollers at the back of your head horizontally or vertically, depending on the look you’re going for. Using horizontal rollers will give you more of a voluminous curl, while putting in your rollers vertically will result in more of a spiral curl. Since you’re not using heat, it will take several hours for the curls to set, so plan to leave the rollers in for at least 4 hours, although overnight is better. If you want your hair to dry faster without adding any heat, use a hair dryer set to its coolest temperature. Hide the rollers by wrapping your head in a silk scarf if you need to go somewhere before your curls are set. Once your hair is completely dry, take the clips out of the rollers, untie the T-shirt strips, or remove the bobby pins from your hair. Do this gently, especially if you want tighter curls. For loose curls or big waves, gently run a wide-toothed comb through your hair. You can also run your fingers through your curls to fan them out, but do not brush them. Set the look with a little hairspray if you'd like.","completion":"To make different types of curls, use big rollers for larger curls and more volume, and smaller rollers for tighter curls; start with damp hair, roll your hair in a pattern for a symmetrical look, let it set for a few hours or overnight, and gently remove the rollers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: Bradley was the apparent target of G. E. Moore's radical rejection of idealism. Moore claimed that Bradley did not understand the statement that something is real. We know for certain, through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things are real, whether they are objects of thought or not, according to Moore. The 1903 article The Refutation of Idealism is one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism esse est percipi, \\"to be is to be perceived\\", finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are necessarily connected so that \\"yellow\\" and \\"the sensation of yellow\\" are identical - \\"to be yellow\\" is \\"to be experienced as yellow\\". But it also seems there is a difference between \\"yellow\\" and \\"the sensation of yellow\\" and \\"that esse is held to be percipi, solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it\\". Though far from a complete refutation, this was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors, or at any rate against the type of idealism represented by Berkeley.

But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs.

Here are the steps to consider in determining the validity of this claim: 1. Research global backgammon player demographics: Investigate the demographics of backgammon players worldwide, focusing on the countries and regions where the game is popular. 2. Compare nationalities of top players: Look at the nationalities of the top-ranked backgammon players over the years, including world championship winners and participants. 3. Analyze backgammon's historical and cultural origins: Understanding the origins and cultural significance of backgammon could provide insight into the locations where the game is more prevalent and which groups of people may be more likely to play. 4. Study international tournament participation rates: Comparing the number of American participants to those from other countries in backgammon tournaments could shed light on whether Americans are more dominant in the game. 5. Consider additional factors: Bear in mind other factors such as the online gaming community and casual players that may not participate in international tournaments, potentially offering a broader perspective on the nationality of backgammon players. Based on the limited information on Carol Ann Crawford, we cannot infer that most people who play backgammon are of American descent.

What is the answer for the question: What year was the river that flows between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range established as a National Natural Landmark? from the following article ? The Willamette River ( (listen) wil-AM-it) is a major tributary of the Columbia River, accounting for 12 to 15 percent of the Columbia's flow. The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? A:","completion":"Step 1: Read the entire review and look for key sentiment words. I'm going to read the review and identify the key sentiment words. The key sentiment words include \\"great book\\", \\"dislike\\", \\"no one tells you\\", and \\"tacky\\". Step 2: Determine the sentiment from the key words. The review has a positive sentiment towards the book itself with the phrase \\"great book\\". However, the reviewer has a negative sentiment about the fact that it's a reprint and it wasn't mentioned, as shown by the words \\"dislike\\", \\"no one tells you\\", and \\"tacky\\". Step 3: Weigh the importance of positive and negative sentiments. In this case, the reviewer's negative sentiment seems to focus mainly on the fact that it's a reprint rather than the quality of the book. Hence, it might weigh more heavily on the overall sentiment. Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment. Considering the information available, the review conveys a more negative sentiment because, although the reviewer thinks the book is great, they feel deceived by the fact that it's a reprint, and it was not mentioned anywhere. This seems to be the primary concern of the reviewer: their dissatisfaction with how the product was promoted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - use of water - drowning - rash - wet skin - dry skin Explain why a human would choose \\"wet skin\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"The most common, but not long-lasting, side effect of having a bath is wet skin. While all the given options can be associated with taking a bath, wet skin is the most accurate and typical outcome for a human. 1. Use of water: Although the use of water is an essential part of having a bath, it is not considered a side effect, as it is a primary requirement for the activity itself. A side effect typically refers to an unintended or secondary result, whereas using water is an intentional part of bathing. 2. Drowning: While it is possible for someone to drown in a bath, it is a very rare and extreme occurrence. Drowning is not a common side effect of having a bath, making it an inappropriate answer to the question. 3. Rash: Some individuals may experience rashes after bathing due to allergic reactions to bath products, contaminants in water, or excessive exposure to hot water, causing skin irritation. Although these cases exist, the occurrence of rashes as a side effect of having a bath is relatively unusual and not as common as having wet skin. 4. Wet skin: It is natural and almost inevitable that a person's skin will become wet during a bath. Wet skin is not only the most common side effect, but it is also temporary and not long lasting. After a few minutes of air drying or using a towel, it will return to its normal state. This is why a human would choose \\"wet skin\\" as the correct answer. 5. Dry skin: Although some individuals might experience dry skin after a bath, especially if they use harsh soaps or take very hot baths, it is not as universal and immediate an effect compared to wet skin. In many cases, proper skincare, such as moisturizing after a bath, can prevent the issue. In conclusion, wet skin is the most common and not long-lasting side effect of having a bath. This is the logical choice for a human because it is an occurrence that happens to everyone who takes a bath, is short-lived, and does not pose any significant health risks, unlike other options such as drowning and rash, which are extreme and uncommon consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My apologies as I need to give a little back story first. Please bear with. I first came to the DC/NOVA area via the US Army. It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay. Now, my son and I were invited to a birthday party for this FIVE year old. The sole Parent had rented the club house, surrounding grounds and pool area of a local country club. I would estimate around 30 kids x 1.5 adults. It was catered with both adult and children's foods and beverages, including Wine and Champagne (few here seem able or willing to parent without it). A company was hired to bring in 6 industrial fair/carnival type rides. A mini Ferris Wheel and a mini Roller Coaster included. She even had hired help that distributed Party Bags/Swag Bags that included cologne/perfume for the kids. I don't think my jaw closed the entire time we were there. This was for a FIVE year old! Could you believe she talks about the daughters poor behavior frequently? My Son asked to leave after around 20 mins, According to the above context, answer the following question.

The Secretary of State for India, St John Brodrick, had in fact expressed the need for it to be \\"within the power of the Tibetans to pay\\" and given Younghusband a free hand to be \\"guided by circumstances in this matter\\". Younghusband raised the indemnity demanded from 5,900,000 to 7,500,000 rupees, and further demanded the right for a British trade agent, based at Gyantse, to visit Lhasa \\"for consultations\\". It seems that he was still following Lord Curzon's geo-political agenda to extend British influence in Tibet by securing the Chumbi Valley for Britain. Younghusband wanted the payment to be met by yearly instalments; it would have taken about 75 years for the Tibetans to clear their debt, and since British occupation of the Chumbi valley was surety until payment was completed, the valley would remain in British hands. Younghusband wrote to his wife immediately after the signing; \\"I have got Chumbi for 75 years. I have got Russia out for ever\\". The regent commented that \\"When one has known the scorpion the frog is divine\\". The Amban later publicly repudiated the treaty, while Britain announced that it still accepted Chinese claims of authority over Tibet. Acting Viceroy Lord Ampthill reduced the indemnity by two-thirds and considerably eased the terms in other ways. The provisions of this 1904 treaty were revised in the Anglo-Chinese Convention of 1906. The British, for a fee from the Qing court, also agreed \\"not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the administration of Tibet\\", while China engaged \\"not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet\\".

She notices that the plaid carpet is smoother than the crocheted rug. The blueberry rolls faster on the (A) plaid carpet (B) crocheted rug. Choose the answer between \\"plaid carpet\\" and \\"crocheted rug\\". Answer:","completion":"The answer to the logic test is \\"plaid carpet.\\" Let us dig deeper into the logic behind this choice. When Karen rolls the blueberries on the floors of her house, she observes that the plaid carpet in the living room provides a smoother surface compared to the crocheted rug in the dining room. The rolling speed of an object is influenced by the surface it is rolling on, as friction between the object and surface plays a significant role in determining the rolling speed. In general, smoother surfaces result in less friction, allowing the object to roll faster. In this scenario, the plaid carpet offers a smoother surface with less friction for the blueberries to roll on. As a result, the blueberries roll faster on the plaid carpet compared to the crocheted rug. The crocheted rug has a rougher texture, which increases the friction between the blueberries and the rug, making them roll slower on this surface. Therefore, the correct answer is \\"plaid carpet\\".

Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974.","completion":"The name of the person whose popularity declined markedly in the US after her marriage is Makeba."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation 16*k - 36 = -31*k + 105 for k, follow these steps: Step 1: Add 31*k to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -31*k term on the right side. 16*k - 36 + 31*k = -31*k + 105 + 31*k This simplifies to: 47*k - 36 = 105 Step 2: Now we need to isolate the k term. To do this, add 36 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -36 term on the left side. 47*k - 36 + 36 = 105 + 36 This simplifies to: 47*k = 141 Step 3: Now, to solve for k, divide both sides of the equation by 47. 47*k / 47 = 141 / 47 This gives us: k = 3 So the solution to the equation 16*k - 36 = -31*k + 105 is k = 3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Searching for solace and a new life, Frank moves to a small town nestled in the mountains, hoping the isolation would help him heal. However, he comes to the jarring realization that the town is under the malicious control of a corrupt police chief, Jonas Ritter, and his powerful gang of enforcers who engage in human trafficking, drug smuggling, and racketeering operations. Frank Mitchell (played by a seasoned action star, such as Tom Hardy or Keanu Reeves) discovers that Ritter and his gang have been coercing vulnerable town occupants into joining their criminal enterprise. A concerned Frank befriends the widowed owner of a local diner, May Anderson, and her teenage daughter, Emily (a possible role for a promising young actress). While Frank keeps his past a secret, May shares with him how her late husband, Ben, died mysteriously while attempting to expose Chief Ritter and his gang's crimes. As the relationship between Frank, May, and Emily deepens, Jonas Ritter senses a new threat to his operations. Frank unwittingly arouses tension after defending victims of the gang's violence at May's diner, showcasing his impressive combat skills through a series of well-choreographed and thrilling action sequences. Emily, meanwhile, accidentally stumbles upon a crucial piece of evidence that exposes the sinister group's criminal network. In response, Ritter orders his most ruthless underling, Patrick \\"The Viper\\" Vance, and his crew to eliminate Frank and retrieve the evidence. However, their botched attempt at kidnapping Emily and shooting Frank at home triggers our protagonist's warrior instincts. To protect his new family and bring justice to the town, Frank begins collecting an arsenal of weapons from the fallen members of Ritter's gang during brutal confrontations with multiple thugs. As Frank takes justice into his hands, he is faced with a moral dilemma, against the backdrop of a thrilling action sequence; killing for revenge or bringing the criminals to face the law. With May's emotional support, Frank pursues a plan to expose Ritter and his gang, taking the weapons he had accumulated to dismantle their operation one man at a time. The dynamic racial ultimately culminates in an explosive face-off between Frank and his nemesis, Chief Ritter, in a secluded warehouse. Frank overcomes Ritter's henchmen and his personal demons, disarming Ritter and sparing his life to await rightful punishment per the law. In the aftermath of their victory, Frank, May, and Emily continue to rebuild their lives in the now-free town. Frank accepts a new job as the town's acting sheriff until a replacement is found, and together, they turn May's diner into a center for community outreach and support. The story ends with the promise of a brighter future, as they honor the fallen and pave the way for a sequel that might chronicle Frank's ongoing battle for justice. Harbinger of Vengeance promises to deliver heart-stopping action, suspense, and a compelling story of redemption and personal growth that will resonate with audiences worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Entailment in linguistics refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one requires the truth of the other. In this case, the first sentence and the second sentence have different meanings. The process of my reasoning is as follows: 1. The first sentence: 'I suppose I haven't technically lost it yet,' I babbled. This means that the speaker thinks that they have not yet lost something, but the usage of the word 'technically' suggests that while they might have lost this thing in spirit or function, they have not physically lost it or acknowledge the loss yet. 2. The second sentence: 'I suppose I already lost it.' This suggests that the speaker has accepted that they have lost something. There is a sense of finality and acceptance that is diametrically opposed to the uncertainty and denial present in the first sentence. Hence the meaning of the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Social interaction can help in strengthening relationships and contributes to overall mental wellbeing. 2. Shared responsibility: As you mentioned, you find it hard to manage your kids in public places, and it can be quite overwhelming at times. Having your friend around might have provided the much-needed support and reassurance. Sharing the responsibility with her could have made you feel more confident and relaxed in managing the kids' safety and activities. 3. Emotional support: Your friend's presence could have given you emotional support, as you are likely to be comfortable around her. Sharing your concerns, fears, and joys with a close friend can make a significant difference in your overall emotional health. 4. A sense of adventure and new experiences: Going out with your friend and her kids might have presented an opportunity for you to step out of your comfort zone and explore new places and experiences. Engaging in such activities can be thrilling and rewarding. 5. Building self-esteem: Accompanying your friend on this outing might have helped you realize that you are capable of handling your kids in public places. This experience could have boosted your self-esteem, making you feel more competent and confident in your parenting abilities. 6. Strengthening bonds with your kids: Participating in fun and engaging activities with your children can bring you closer, helping you create priceless memories together. You might have been excited about the prospect of enjoying quality time with your kids and building stronger bonds with them. 7. Learning from your friend: As she is evidently more experienced and braver in handling such situations, this presented an opportunity for you to observe and learn from her. Observing her parenting methods and approach to dealing with public outings might have inspired you or given you practical tips to apply in the future. In conclusion, being invited by your friend to go out with her and your kids might have provided you with social interaction, shared responsibility, emotional support, new experiences, increased self-esteem, and the opportunity to strengthen bonds with your children and learn from a more experienced friend.

I suppose it was ok… oh, who am I kidding, the harbour is spectacular. Let me also point out that none of these images are touched by editing. Like 99% of my images in this blog (the other 1% is cropping and making slight adjustments), these are entirely un-doctored. We began as all good things do, by hanging out in their airport lounge, offered a mini-pastry and a hot beverage – I adventurously went for an ‘English Mist’, an Earl-Grey Latte to make myself feel a little more soothed boarding a tiny propeller plane (note: it didn’t work.)

Oscar Pistorius pleads 'enough is enough' as he demands an end to court bid to increase his six year sentence for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp Blade Runner athlete is fighting appeal against 'shockingly lenient' sentence for killing Reeva Steenkamp LAWYERS for Oscar Pistorius will argue “enough is enough” when his case resumes in court next week as prosecutors seek to have his six-year jail term for murder increased. The shamed Blade Runner athlete, 29, is fighting the appeal brought by state prosecutors on the grounds the sentence is “shockingly lenient”. In court papers filed last week, his defence team says it will argue “a continuation of this matter is inimical to the interests of justice, patently unfair and that enough is enough.” Pistorius blasted his lover Reeva Steenkamp to death after a row at his luxury villa in Pretoria on Valentine’s Day 2013. He was initially convicted of the equivalent of manslaughter but it was changed to murder after an appeal. Last month the state said it would appeal the six-year jail term, which was less than half the 15 years it had sought. National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku said the case would be heard at the High Court in Pretoria next Friday before the original trial Judge Thokozile Masipa.

Given the following context: The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\".The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\". A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton. From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \\"Carlsbad plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\\".

The right side of the equation has two terms with the variable f, -28852*f and 57740*f. -28852*f + 57740*f = (57740 - 28852)*f = 28888*f So, the equation becomes: 28737*f = 28888*f + 7550 Step 2: Move all terms with the variable f to one side of the equation. To isolate f, subtract 28737*f from both sides of the equation: 28737*f - 28737*f = 28888*f - 28737*f Which simplifies to: 0 = 151*f + 7550 Step 3: Isolate the variable f. To isolate f, subtract 7550 from both sides: -7550 = 151*f Now divide both sides by 151: f = -7550 / 151 Step 4: Simplify the expression. f ≈ -50 Thus, the solution to the equation is f ≈ -50."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"This review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light for numerous reasons. The reviewer's use of strong negative language, dissatisfaction with the pacing, and the overall tone all contribute to an unfavorable perception of the product. By analyzing the review, we can pinpoint specific aspects that led to this unfavorable representation. 1. Use of strong negative language: The reviewer starts with the title \\"It sucked\\" and states \\"I hated it.\\" Such strong negative expressions immediately imply a negative opinion about the product and indicate that the reviewer had a deeply unfavorable experience with it. 2. Criticism of pacing: The reviewer mentions that HG Wells takes way too long to get to the point, which can be interpreted as a lack of engagement and dissatisfaction with the storytelling style. This criticism could possibly discourage potential readers who might be looking for faster-paced narratives or high levels of excitement throughout the book. 3. Difficulty in finishing the book: The reviewer's statement that it was annoying trying to finish the book suggests that it was a struggle to persist with the story until the end. This reinforces the negative impression, as it illustrates a lack of enjoyable or compelling content that would have kept the reader engaged. 4. Overall tone: The review has an overall negative and dismissive tone, which can potentially influence other readers' perception of the product. By sharing an unfavorable experience, it may lead others to think that they, too, would not enjoy the book and may deter them from considering it as a reading option. In conclusion, the review depicts the product in a highly unflattering light by utilizing strong negative language, expressing dissatisfaction with the book's pacing, noting the struggle in finishing it, and employing a generally negative tone.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Washington, D.C., formally the District of Columbia and commonly referred to as Washington or D.C., is the capital of the United States. Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country, Washington was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States and a Founding Father. As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations, Washington is an important world political capital. The city is also one of the most visited cities in the world, with more than 20 million tourists annually.The signing of the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country's East Coast. The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress, and the District is therefore not a part of any state. The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district, which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria. The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital. In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia; in 1871, it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District. Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018, making it the 20th most populous city in the United States. Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek. Washington's metropolitan area, the country's sixth largest, had a 2017 estimated population of 6.2 million residents.All three branches of the U.S. federal government are centered in the District: Congress (legislative), president (executive), and the U.S. Supreme Court (judicial).

He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. \\"I don't like it at home,\\" he told his mother, \\"but I can't bear it anywhere else.\\" His return was often difficult for his family; Gabrielle said, \\"good days in my parents' home were good days for Nick, and bad days were bad days for Nick. And that was what their life revolved around, really.\\"Drake lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer he received from Island Records (equivalent to £238 in 2018). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes. He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: \\"He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back.\\" Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously depressed: \\"There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around.\\"John Martyn (who in 1973 wrote the title song of his album Solid Air about Drake) described Drake in this period as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose, until he ran out of petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected.

Context: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore. Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores. The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added. For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\" The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy. It has the world's seventh-largest economy. Within a decade, it is expected to pass China to become the world's most populous country. Question: What is probably true of India? Options: A. the population will pass China's B. not enough information C. the population will severely decline D. the population will stay the same A:","completion":"A. the population will pass China's"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Incident: According to investigators, the boy was subjected to a satanic ritual by his family members, who ordered him to close his eyes out of respect. However, the terrified child was unable to comply due to fear. In response to his reluctance, the family members took drastic and violent measures. The mother grabbed a wooden spoon and, with the help of the other family members, proceeded to cruelly gouge out the boy's eyes. Neighbors Respond: The horrific event caught the attention of neighbors in Nezahualcoyotl, who heard the child's agonizing screams. Concerned for the boy's well-being, they promptly contacted local authorities to report the incident. Police and Legal Action: Upon arrival at the scene, police found the child in excruciating pain and immediately arranged for medical assistance. The family members present during the incident were arrested shortly afterwards. Following a thorough investigation by local authorities, the boy's mother, aunt, two uncles, and grandparents were each sentenced to serve 30 years in prison for their appalling crimes. Community Reactions: The Nezahualcoyotl community has been left shaken by the incident, with many expressing outrage and disbelief over the family's cruel actions. Several local organizations have sent messages of support to the young victim and have called for continued awareness and vigilance to prevent similar acts from occurring in the future. Conclusion: The brutal case of child abuse in Nezahualcoyotl, Mexico is a stark reminder of the unimaginable horrors some children face at the hands of their own family members. The swift action of concerned neighbors and local authorities led to the arrest and sentencing of the culprits, providing some measure of justice for the young boy. However, it is crucial for communities to remain vigilant in order to protect children from such harrowing abuse and ensure their safety and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It shows a direct and personal message from the sender to the receiver. 2. \\"Good thing you're not in the cockpit.\\" - This statement has a touch of light humor and potentially sarcasm, implying that the recipient might have exhibited a behavior or made a statement that could be seen as undesirable or inapt if they were the pilot of an aircraft. This part of the tweet is not necessarily insulting or negative, but rather an amusing way of acknowledging a situation or comment made by the recipient that is deemed not ideal for a pilot. 3. \\"Safe flight\\" - This is a well-wishing statement and a gesture of care from the sender to the receiver. It indicates that despite the humor in the tweet, the sender genuinely hopes for a safe and pleasant flight experience for the recipient. This part of the tweet brings a positive and friendly tone to the overall sentiment.

A repository is like a toy store that collects many packages (boxes of toys) so people can find and use the software they need. 2. What is the difference between facade, proxy, and repository design patterns in software development? This question is asking about how people design and build software. In this case, the design patterns are like instructions for playing with three different types of toys: - Facade: Imagine there's a big toy robot with many buttons. A facade pattern is like creating one big button that does many actions (presses different tiny buttons) at once, making it easier to play with the toy robot. - Proxy: Suppose you have a toy car that's controlled remotely. The proxy pattern is like adding a helper toy that controls the car for you, letting you play with the car without directly controlling it yourself. - Repository: Remember the toy store? The repository design pattern is like having a notebook that keeps track of all the toys in the store, making it easy to find and use the toys without searching every shelf.

Recommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence-and counterterrorism-is now dysfunctional. Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

Article: Rather than blasting your car with a high-pressure stream, which could potentially damage the paint, wet troublesome spots thoroughly, then leave them to sit for several minutes. This will rinse off loose debris and help soften dried residue. If you only have a smattering of insects stuck to your car, a light soak may be all you need to get rid of them. Combine one part soap with three parts water in a large bucket until it’s sudsy. Dip a soft sponge or absorbent cloth into the soap solution and spread it across the car’s exterior. The mild surfactants in the soap should begin to dissolve the bugs right away. Use a specialty car wash product, not household soaps or cleaners. These contain compounds that can easily damage your vehicle’s paint. It’s a good idea to go ahead and wash your whole car, just in case there are a few spots you’ve missed. Use smooth circular motions to coax out the worst of the crusty mess. Rewet the sponge as needed and continue scrubbing until your paint or windshield is spotless. Make sure to check for insects in less noticeable areas, like the grill, headlights, mirrors and the base of the windshield. Picking at difficult spots with a fingernail or plastic scraper can help dislodge them. Use a separate cloth or sponge to clean your wheels. This will help you avoid transferring substances like sand, brake fluid and grease to your car’s exterior. Once you’ve washed your car, spray it off with the hose to remove any remaining traces of soap or debris. Wipe away standing water with a microfiber towel or squeegee, then let the vehicle air dry. Afterwards, it should look as good as new! Don’t skip the final wipedown—hard water can leave behind stains that can eventually become permanently etched into your car’s paint.

I have a new situation: Except for their color, there are two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom that the children can use during free time. Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs. But I can use this background: What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. What is an answer for this question: Which chair has a lower air pressure? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The red chair has a lower air pressure. Here's the step-by-step justification for the answer: 1. Patrick and Mark are sitting on identical inflatable chairs, with the only difference being their colors. Patrick sits on the red chair, and Mark, who weighs more than Patrick, sits on the green chair. 2. Since Mark weighs more than Patrick, the additional weight on the green chair will cause it to compress more than the red chair. The distribution of the weight will cause the volume of the green chair to decrease. 3. According to Boyle's law, if the temperature of a gas is held constant, decreasing the volume of the gas will result in an increase in pressure. 4. As the volume of the green chair decreases due to Mark's weight, the air pressure inside the chair will increase. 5. Therefore, the red chair, which is not experiencing the same decrease in volume due to Patrick's lower weight, will have a lower air pressure when compared to the green chair."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jessica is currently looking for a forest to go camping in and is trying to choose which of these two forests she will visit for a week. Jessica despises camping in the rain and also prefers a more moderate temperature. Luckily, her trip isn't for several months so she has plenty of time to make up her mind. and a hint : Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. Please answer this question : Which forest's soil will be colored red? The answer is:","completion":"The Farlook forest's soil will be colored red. Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the given question and hint. - Farlook forest is a tropical forest - Celeste forest is not a tropical forest - Tropical forests have little to no podzolization - Mobile metals Mg, Fe, and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals in tropical forests, giving the soil a rusty red color.

Media images of the perfect body, the perfect lifestyle, the perfect job and the like are targeted at making us all feel \\"less than.\\" You can choose whether or not to entertain these thoughts. Stop comparing yourself to others. The moment you compare yourself with others, you reduce your own unique worth. You have talents, abilities and foibles that are unique to you. Own them and help them to either shine or disappear, as needed. The comparison is for prices, not people. Stop thinking that you aren't equipped to handle a situation or thinking everything always goes wrong regardless. Thinking this way actively undermines your functioning. Instead, replace thoughts like these with logic, and try to find a solution to your situation. Because you'll probably be wrong about the outcome! When we start thinking, \\"Oh God, so and so is going to do this if I do this,\\" it's all too easy to start freaking out. If you don't concern yourself with the consequences, there's no fear or worry. Simply act on your gut. You can't predict the future, so why try? Think of your life and what's going on around you like a movie. Rise above what is happening and pretend you're observing somebody else, not yourself. This action allows you to objectively interpret a situation without involving your emotions. Imagine that you're looking at the situation as an outsider, with no prior knowledge of the subject matter and no emotional involvement. With dissociation, you don't allow yourself to be subjective; instead, you remain objective, like a doctor treating a patient. In neuro-linguistic programming, this technique is called \\"reframing.\\" Be careful with dissociation because it comes with inherent risks. Dissociating too often can lead to unhealthy results in your mind and your personality if you're not careful. Only dissociate on a situation-by-situation basis, not as your ultimate response to every difficult situation. Sometimes you need to face certain things head on instead of dissociating. Rather than assuming things based on fear, anger or similar emotional reactions, work purely with facts. Logic often combats out-of-control emotions and allows you to see the reality in any situation. After all, reality is outside your head -- not your interpretation of it. If you're afraid you won't do well in a job interview, remind yourself of the facts. First, you wouldn't have gotten an interview if you didn't have the qualifications. Second, if you don't get the job, you may not be a good fit for the company, but it doesn't mean you aren't a good candidate. Staying logical in an emotional crisis allows us to take well-established mental shortcuts instead of thinking things through more substantially. When you're used to reacting emotionally to difficult situations, you have to retrain your mind to think logically. Once in a while, they come in handy. We have them for a reason -- if they weren't useful, we wouldn't have evolved them. In fact, studies show that when we go off our gut, sometimes (usually when we're low on energy) we make better decisions. So if you're feeling something, determine if it's valid. If it is, you may want to stick with it. If it's not valid, throw it out the window. Defenestrate it. If it's paranoid, neurotic, worrisome, fearful, or nauseating, let it go. It's just that voice in your head that's there to drive you batty. If it is valid (grief, for example, is a negative emotion that's valid), acknowledge it. You cannot let it go until you do so. Accept that you had the thought and let it pass. It will get replaced by another in time. Summary:","completion":"Focus on embracing your unique qualities and combat negative emotions with logic instead of comparing yourself to others, while being cautious about dissociating too often and acknowledging valid feelings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Parts of a Typical Rib The posterior end of a typical rib is called the head of the rib (see Figure 7.27). This region articulates primarily with the costal facet located on the body of the same numbered thoracic vertebra and to a lesser degree, with the costal facet located on the body of the next higher vertebra. Lateral to the head is the narrowed neck of the rib. A small bump on the posterior rib surface is the tubercle of the rib, which articulates with the facet located on the transverse process of the same numbered vertebra. The remainder of the rib is the body of the rib (shaft). Just lateral to the tubercle is the angle of the rib, the point at which the rib has its greatest degree of curvature. The angles of the ribs form the most posterior extent of the thoracic cage. In the anatomical position, the angles align with the medial border of the scapula.

The eatType suggests that this establishment primarily focuses on serving coffee along with a variety of other drinks and a selection of food items, mostly consisting of pastries, sandwiches, and other light fare. This makes it an ideal spot for people seeking a quick bite or a place to unwind, chat, or work while sipping on their favorite caffeinated or non-caffeinated beverages. In terms of affordability, The Vaults has a price range of less than £20, ensuring customers can enjoy their offerings without breaking the bank. This positions the coffee shop as a budget-friendly option that caters to a wide variety of customers, including students, professionals, and casual visitors seeking a relaxing and cost-effective locale. For those value-conscious customers, they will find The Vaults to be quite accommodating to their budgetary constraints. However, it is essential to note that The Vaults has a low customer rating. This rating could be attributed to a variety of factors such as the quality of the coffee and food items served, the service provided by the staff, and the overall ambiance within the establishment. Potential customers may want to consider this aspect before deciding to visit, as their experience may not meet their expectations based on the customer ratings and feedback. Despite the low customer ratings, The Vaults' riverside location presents an undeniable allure. The tranquil setting is often enticing for customers in search of a peaceful backdrop for their leisurely visits or work sessions. The riverside location can also serve as a beautiful spot for romantic outings, friendly gatherings, or a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Furthermore, The Vaults is situated near another popular establishment, Café Brazil.

In conclusion, The Vaults is an affordable coffee shop situated in a beautiful riverside location, offering customers a budget-friendly option for coffee, drinks, and light meals. While the low customer rating may signal some issues regarding the quality of service, it should not deter interested visitors entirely, given the tranquil riverside setting and proximity to other popular establishments like Café Brazil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Independent assortment occurs when what go to opposite poles of the cell in anaphase i? Choices: - receptors - ballasts - prokaryotes - chromosomes A: A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's first understand the concept of independent assortment and its significance during meiosis. Independent assortment refers to the process by which the chromosomes inherited from each parent are randomly distributed to the offspring during gamete formation via meiosis. This allows for increased genetic diversity in offspring. Now, let's examine the choices provided and identify which one correctly fits the description of independent assortment. 1. Receptors: Receptors are usually proteins or glycoproteins that are found in the cell membrane and serve as signaling molecules. They play no role in independent assortment. 2. Ballasts: Ballasts are typically electrical devices used for regulating electrical current and have no relevance in the context of independent assortment or meiosis. 3. Prokaryotes: Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles like eukaryotes. While prokaryotes do have chromosomes, the term \\"prokaryotes\\" does not accurately describe independent assortment as it focuses on the organism rather than the genetic material. 4. Chromosomes: Chromosomes carry the genetic material in the form of genes and are the structures that undergo independent assortment during meiosis. They are correctly associated with the process of independent assortment, as they segregate and go to opposite poles of the cell in anaphase I.

Changes in the RNA sequence often result in mutations because the RNA sequence is a vital part of the genetic expression of an organism. In other words, any changes in this sequence can lead to changes in the physical or physiological traits of an organism which we refer to as mutations. From the information given, we know that group L displayed all kinds of mutations, while group D did not. This suggests that the RNA sequence in group L must have changed significantly to result in these mutations. On the other hand, the absence of mutations in group D suggests that there were little to no changes in the RNA sequence of this group of larvae.

Question: This article: After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,... contains an answer for the question: What three bodily fluids did Serrano use for the album cover art for Reload and Load?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The three bodily fluids that Andres Serrano used for the album cover art for Metallica's Load and Reload are: 1. Blood: Serrano used his own blood for the cover art of the Load album, titled \\"Blood and Semen III.\\" The blood was pressed between sheets of plexiglass to create the desired effect. 2. Semen: In the same artwork, \\"Blood and Semen III\\" for the Load album, Serrano also included his own semen mixed with the blood. The combination of these two bodily fluids created a unique and controversial visual effect for the album cover. 3. Urine: For the follow-up album, Reload, Serrano created the cover art using a mixture of blood and urine. Although it wasn't explicitly mentioned if the blood and urine were both his own, it can be inferred from the context provided for Load's artwork that Serrano might have used his own bodily fluids for both covers. So the answer is: blood, semen, and urine were the three bodily fluids used by Andres Serrano for the album cover art for Metallica's Load and Reload albums."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

One of Hunter's first films for Warners was The Sea Chase (1955), supporting John Wayne and Lana Turner. It was a big hit, but Hunter's part was relatively small. Rushes were seen by William Wellman, who cast Hunter to play the younger brother of Robert Mitchum in Track of the Cat (1955). It was a solid hit and Hunter began to get more notice. His breakthrough role came when he was cast as the young Marine Danny in 1955's World War II drama Battle Cry. His character has an affair with an older woman, but ends up marrying the girl next door. It was based on a bestseller by Leon Uris and became Warner Bros largest grossing film of that year, cementing Hunter's position as one of Hollywood's top young romantic leads. In September 1955 the tabloid magazine Confidential reported Hunter's 1950 arrest for disorderly conduct. The innuendo-laced article, and a second one focusing on Rory Calhoun's prison record, were the result of a deal Henry Willson had brokered with the scandal rag in exchange for not revealing his more prominent client Rock Hudson's sexual orientation to the public. Not only did this have no negative effect on Hunter's career, a few months later he was named Most Promising New Personality in a nationwide poll sponsored by the Council of Motion Picture Organizations. In 1956, he received 62,000 Valentines. Hunter, James Dean and Natalie Wood were the last of the actors placed under exclusive studio contract to Warner Bros. Warners decided to promote him to star status, teaming him with Natalie Wood in two back-to-back films, a Western, The Burning Hills (1956), directed by Heisler, and The Girl He Left Behind (1956), a service comedy. These films also proved to be hits with audiences and Warners planned a third teaming of Hunter and Wood. Hunter rejected the third picture, thus ending Warner's attempt to make Tab and Natalie the William Powell and Myrna Loy of the 1950s. Hunter was Warner Bros.' most popular male star from 1955-1959.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the site for which the responsible Trust warden has chosen to leave the patch of scorched earth rather than seeding it over? ? In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up. A:","completion":"The name of the site for which the responsible Trust warden has chosen to leave the patch of scorched earth rather than seeding it over is the Coldrum Stones. The Coldrum Stones are a part of the Medway Megaliths and are owned by The National Trust. The patch of scorched earth exists in the center of the monument and is left there by the Trust warden to encourage those who light fires to do so in the same spot rather than closer to the stones."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Identify the decision-making body: I know that in the United States, the Senate and House of Representatives are two parts of Congress, which is the legislative branch of the government. 2. Research the salary-setting process in the legislative branch: Through research, I've found that salaries for members of Congress, including Senate and House of Representatives, are determined by a specific process. 3. Identify the laws and regulations that govern this process: The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 established an automatic cost-of-living adjustment to congressional salaries. Additionally, the 27th Amendment to the Constitution states that any salary increase or decrease for Senators and Representatives cannot take effect until after the next election. 4. Determine who is involved in the decision-making process: Congress, through its legislative powers, has the ability to adjust the salaries of its members. Congress can pass a new law that may affect its members' salaries, subject to the approval by the President. Conclusion: The salaries for Senate and House members are set by Congress, through legislation that is passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and signed into law by the President.

Art of Noise (also The Art of Noise) were an English avant-garde synth-pop group formed in early 1983 by engineer/producer Gary Langan and programmer J. J. Jeczalik, along with arranger Anne Dudley, producer Trevor Horn and music journalist Paul Morley. The group had international Top 20 hits with \\"Kiss\\" and the instrumental \\"Peter Gunn\\", which won a 1986 Grammy Award. The group's mostly instrumental compositions were novel melodic sound collages based on digital sampler technology, which was new at the time. Inspired by turn-of-the-20th-century revolutions in music, the Art of Noise were initially packaged as a faceless anti- or non-group, blurring the distinction between the art and its creators. Although Dudley and Jeczalik had already dissolved the group, in 1990 they assisted in the promotion of the lightly remixed compilation The Ambient Collection, which the China label released to cash in on the burgeoning ambient house scene. Jeczalik approved the remixes that appeared on The FON Mixes the following year. The rest of the decade saw China Records releasing further Art of Noise compilations: The Drum and Bass Collection, Art Works, and reissues of Best of without the ZTT-era tracks. Some of these featured new remixes by other artists. According to an interview with J.J. Jeczalik reported in the ZTT fanzine Outside World in 1991, Jeczalik, Dudley and Langan were inspired by the commercial success of The FON Mixes and had discussed reuniting the group as a trio again. In preparation to record a new album, Jeczalik and Langan travelled to Cuba to gather new source material. However, no new recordings were produced with the new line-up, and the Art of Noise remained defunct. Dudley became well known for composing numerous film and television scores during the 1990s. The most famous of these is probably The Full Monty, which won an Academy Award for Original Music Score. She also collaborated with Killing Joke's Jaz Coleman on the 1990 album Songs from the Victorious City (inspired by a trip the two made to Egypt) and produced two tracks for the 1993 Deborah Harry album Debravation (\\"Strike Me Pink\\", which she also co-wrote and played keyboards on) and \\"Mood Ring\\"). She has scored orchestrations for dozens of pop releases over the years, and both scored and produced the album Voice for her neighbour Alison Moyet. Cathy Dennis added lyrics to one of Dudley's compositions and recorded it as \\"Too Many Walls\\", which became a US Top 10 hit in 1991. In 1995-1997, Jeczalik and In No Sense? Nonsense! coengineer Bob Kraushaar produced a number of instrumentals oriented toward dance clubs under the name Art of Silence, issuing an album titled artofsilence.co.uk. Jeczalik also embarked on a new career in trading in futures contracts. The Art of Noise also received a full writing credit for The Prodigy's \\"Firestarter\\", which samples the female \\"hey, hey\\" voice from \\"Close to the Edit\\". The Prodigy also contributed the remix \\"Instruments of Darkness (All of Us are One People)\\" to the 1991 compilation The FON Mixes. Also, an edited version of \\"Close to the Edit\\" is featured on the monthly educational Amiga game, Ready Robot Club. The Art of Noise are also credited for the music to the ITV series The Krypton Factor.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: were any of her songs hits?","completion":"Yes, one of her songs was a hit.

Options: - thrift store - clothing store - costume shop - shopping mall - laundromat Explain why a human would choose \\"laundromat\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"laundromat\\" to answer the question above because a laundromat is the most appropriate and logical option among the given choices when it comes to washing jeans or any other clothing items. Laundromats are facilities specifically designed and equipped for washing, drying, and sometimes folding clothes. They provide a convenient and efficient solution for people in need of laundry services, especially when they are unable to do the laundry at home due to issues like power outages or broken washing machines. Let us examine why the other options are not suitable for the given situation: 1. Thrift store - A thrift store is a place where people can buy or donate used and inexpensive items, including clothing, shoes, and accessories. While many thrift stores sell pre-owned clothes, they do not offer laundry services. Thus, a thrift store would not be the appropriate place to wash your jeans. 2. Clothing store - A clothing store is a retail store that sells new clothes, shoes, and accessories. Some might offer alteration services for the items they sell, but washing clothes is not a service provided by clothing stores. Consequently, this option is also not suitable for the given situation. 3. Costume shop - A costume shop specializes in selling or renting costumes, accessories, and props for various events such as parties, theatrical productions, and themed events. While they deal with clothing items, their primary focus is on costumes and not regular clothing like jeans. Additionally, they do not offer laundry services as part of their business model. Therefore, a costume shop would not be a viable option for washing your jeans. 4. Shopping mall - A shopping mall is a large enclosed building that houses a variety of retail stores, food outlets, and entertainment facilities. Although it is possible to find a variety of clothing stores and possibly even a laundromat within a shopping mall, the term \\"shopping mall\\" does not refer to a specific service for washing clothes. Therefore, choosing \\"shopping mall\\" as the answer does not provide a direct and accurate solution to the problem at hand. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"laundromat\\" as the best answer for the question because it is the most fitting option among the given choices when faced with the need to wash jeans when the electricity is cut off. Laundromats offer a convenient, efficient, and accessible solution to washing clothes and are specifically tailored to cater to such needs. The other options, despite being related to clothing in some way, do not provide adequate laundry services and thus, are not suitable for addressing the needs of the given situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 2: What does a first time author do to market his own book? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Hi there, little buddy! Let me explain the answers to these questions for you. Question 1: How much money does a first-time New York Times bestseller author typically make from book sales? The money a first-time New York Times bestseller author makes can be different for each author. But let's say they earn around 1 to 3 for every book they sell. If they sell 100,000 copies of their book, they could make between 100,000 to 300,000. Remember that they might need to share some of that money with other people, like publishers or agents, and they might need to pay some taxes too. Question 2: What does a first-time author do to market his own book? A first-time author can do many things to tell people about their book! They might use social media like Facebook or Instagram, talk to bloggers or YouTubers, give interviews to newspapers or TV shows, and maybe even visit schools or libraries. They can also work with their publisher to plan special events or promotions to get people excited about their book. Now, the answer to these two questions is not the same. The first question is about how much money a successful author can make, and the second question is about the actions an author can take to promote their book.

A paperback is a book with a soft cover, and they are usually smaller and thinner than other books. The shelf was designed to hold these smaller books. So, the boy tried his best to put the big book on the shelf meant for the paperbacks. But guess what happened? The big book fell to the ground! This happened because the shelf was too narrow for the big book to fit on it. In other words, the shelf that was meant for the smaller, thinner books couldn't hold the big, thick book because it wasn't wide enough. The little boy realized that he needed a different shelf, one that was big enough to hold his big book. So, he went on a search for the perfect shelf that would fit his huge book and keep it safe.

Nevertheless, I'll attempt to provide a thorough analysis based upon what we have. The review pertains to an issue the reviewer is facing: they're not certain how to download files. This could point to a couple of potential problems. Firstly, the app's user interface might not be intuitive or user-friendly, making what should be straightforward tasks, like downloading files, confusing or difficult. Alternatively, this difficulty could also be due to a lack of proper guidance or instructions provided within the app. Nonetheless, this is just one user's experience, and it could be an isolated case. The reviewer could possibly be unfamiliar with the technology, particularly if they're not used to digital platforms or have had little previous exposure. The commenter might also have overlooked instructions or be unaware of resources available for help. Considering these factors, it's also important to account for other reviews and experiences. It would be more balanced to assess multiple users' feedbacks, as well as consider aspects such as the app's functionality, design, responsiveness, the utility it provides, its regularity and proficiency of updates, customer service, and overall user experience.

Secondly, the user notes that KitchenAid, the manufacturer of the product, sent them a replacement. This replacement could have been an opportunity for the user to receive a product that performed better and potentially change their opinion of the brand. 3. However, the user then reported that the blade broke free from the jar after only five uses.

Write an article based on this \\"The race is on to find ways to prevent and cure the Ebola virus - a disease that has killed more than 10,000 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.\\"","completion":"Title: Combating the Ebola Virus: Striving for Prevention and Cure Introduction The Ebola virus has been the cause of fear and panic for communities worldwide, especially in West Africa, where it has claimed more than 10,000 lives, primarily in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. This severe and often fatal disease has haunted nations and led to an urgent global race to find ways for its prevention and cure. Researchers and biologists are peeling back the layers surrounding the virus, striving to devise suitable vaccines and medications. In this article, we will delve into the ongoing scientific and medical quest for the solution to combat the Ebola virus and save countless lives. Understanding the Ebola Virus The Ebola virus is from the family Filoviridae, with five known subtypes, four of which are responsible for causing the disease in humans. The virus spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, saliva, feces, and vomit. Symptoms begin with sudden onset fever, extreme weakness, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, and headache, progressing to vomiting, diarrhea, kidney and liver damage, internal and external bleeding, and ultimately in many cases, death. The fatality rate varies between 25% and 90%, depending on the specific outbreak and intervention methods. Efforts to Prevent the Spread of Ebola Given the severe infectious nature of the Ebola virus, it became paramount to curb the spread of the disease early on through various methods: 1. Isolation and Quarantine: As the virus spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids, isolating infected individuals from the community and placing them in quarantine has been essential to reduce further transmission. 2. Travel Restrictions: International health authorities have issued travel restrictions to and from affected areas, ensuring that proper screening processes are in place at airports, seaports, and other entry points. 3. Health Education: By educating the public about the transmission risks and precautionary methods, awareness on personal hygiene, sanitation, and safe handling of deceased Ebola patients is significantly increased. 4. Rapid Diagnostic Tools: Development of fast and accurate diagnostic tools has facilitated early identification and containment of possible outbreaks. The Race for a Vaccine and Treatment With no approved treatments for the Ebola virus, scientists worldwide have focused their efforts on developing a vaccine and antiviral drugs. 1. Vaccines: In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in the development of an Ebola vaccine, with the rVSV-ZEBOV (recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus–Zaire Ebola virus) candidate showing promising results for protection against the virus. The vaccine has proven nearly 100% effective in clinical trials conducted in Guinea, providing immunity for at least 12 months post-inoculation. However, further research is necessary to understand the long-term efficacy of the vaccine. 2. Antiviral Drugs: Several antiviral drugs are in the experimental stage and have shown promise in treating Ebola patients. One such drug, Remdesivir, has displayed efficacy in limiting the replication of the Ebola virus in animal models. Additional studies are ongoing to evaluate its potential in managing Ebola cases in humans. 3. Monoclonal Antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies capable of recognizing and neutralizing the virus have also shown promising results. The investigational treatment ZMapp, composed of three monoclonal antibodies, has been utilized under emergency conditions for treating Ebola virus-infected patients. 4. Plasma and Convalescent Blood Products: Blood plasma or serum obtained from Ebola survivors, rich in antibodies against the virus, has been used to manage cases under compassionate use. Though the effectiveness of this approach is yet to be scientifically validated, it remains a standard treatment option. Conclusion The race to find ways to prevent and cure the Ebola virus remains an ongoing challenge, with significant progress made in recent years. Collaboration between scientists, governments, and health organizations is crucial to ensure concerted efforts and expedite the development of vaccines, antiviral drugs, and other treatment options that can help put an end to this devastating disease. Collectively, the global community must persevere in its fight against the Ebola virus, ensuring further outbreaks are met with swift and efficient intervention and ultimately eradicating it as a health threat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Affirmed (February 21, 1975 - January 12, 2001) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was the eleventh winner of the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. Affirmed was also known for his famous rivalry with Alydar, whom he met ten times, including in all three Triple Crown races. Affirmed was the last horse to win the Triple Crown for a 37-year period, which was ended in 2015 by American Pharoah. Affirmed won fourteen Grade As a four-year-old in 1979, Affirmed started the season with a third place in the Malibu Stakes and a second in the San Fernando Stakes. He had a five race losing sequence prior to starting in the Charles H. Strub Stakes at Santa Anita Park. Laz Barrera replaced Cauthen with Pincay and Affirmed didn't lose again and would dominate the handicaps the rest of the year. Affirmed won the Strub Stakes, and then ran in the Santa Anita Handicap against Exceller, who had defeated Seattle Slew in 1978. Affirmed won easily, running the 1 1/4 miles in 1:58 3/5, setting a stakes record in California's most important stakes race that stood until 2014. Affirmed then went to Hollywood Park, where he won the Californian Stakes, carrying 132 pounds, he then won the Hollywood Gold Cup in a three horse finish, from Sirlad and Text, setting an all time earnings record and running the 1 1/4 miles in a fast 1:58 2/5. Affirmed picked up the Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park, and then faced one more all-time great horse, three-year-old Spectacular Bid, in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, also at Belmont. Spectacular Bid, like Alydar, preferred to run off the pace, and once again, Affirmed was allowed to set a slow pace, going the first half mile in 49 seconds. Spectacular Bid issued challenges at Affirmed, but Affirmed won. Spectacular Bid was undefeated during the rest of his racing career. Affirmed was named Horse of the Year and the American Champion Older Male Horse of 1979, having won 7 of 9 starts with 1 second and 1 third as a four-year-old and earning 1,148,800. In his career, Affirmed earned a then record 2,393,818 (the first Thoroughbred in North America to win over 2 million) with 22 wins, 5 seconds and 1 third from 29 starts. His trainer, Laz Barrera, once said: \\"Affirmed is greater than Secretariat, or any Triple Crown winner, because only Affirmed had to face Alydar.\\" when was that race?","completion":"The race where Affirmed faced Spectacular Bid in the Jockey Club Gold Cup took place on October 6, 1979, at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. In this race, Affirmed came out victorious, solidifying his position as one of the greatest racehorses in history. This victory further enhanced Affirmed's legacy, as he triumphed over another exceptional horse, Spectacular Bid, who later went on to have a remarkable undefeated streak in his racing career. The Jockey Club Gold Cup is a prestigious event in American Thoroughbred horse racing and has been a platform for many great champions to display their abilities. Affirmed's win in the 1979 Jockey Club Gold Cup highlights one of the numerous accomplishments of this extraordinary horse that helped him earn Horse of the Year and the American Champion Older Male Horse of 1979."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Isis breach of Iraq-Syria border merges two wars into one 'nightmarish reality' An image from the jihadist Twitter account Al-Baraka news allegedly shows Isis vehicles driving on a newly cut road through the Syrian-Iraqi border between the Iraqi Nineveh province and Al-Hassaka in Syria. Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images Under a burning sun, fighters of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) sang and waved their automatic weapons and black jihadi flags as they celebrated breaching the lonely desert frontier between Iraq and Syria. To the soundtrack of a haunting Quranic chant, they watched as a bulldozer burst through a sand berm separating Nineveh in Iraq from the neighbouring Syrian province of al Hassaka, followed by US-made Jeeps and Humvees with Iraqi army insignia that had been captured in the recent fighting. The slick Isis propaganda machine sent the images out under the Twitter hashtag #SykesPicotOver – a gloating reference to the first world war Anglo-French agreement that secretly carved up the territories of the dying Ottoman Empire into British and French spheres of influence and (among others) new Arab nation states ruled from Baghdad and Damascus. Yet jihadi advances are not only erasing the old borders and allowing Isis to claim it is in reach of its goal of creating a new Muslim caliphate, but also ensuring that the wars for Syria and Iraq have merged into one, each feeding on, affecting and sustaining the other. Control of territory in north-eastern Syria helped Isis capture Mosul, Iraq's third-largest city. Money and arms flow easily. Croatian-made anti-tank weapons sent by Saudi Arabia via Jordan to mainstream rebel forces in southern Syria found their way to Isis fighters in Anbar province in Iraq. Last week convoys of trucks carrying captured Iraqi weapons arrived in Hassaka. Equipment including tanks has been moved to Raqqa in Syria, where Isis has its headquarters. \\"The Iraq-Syria border is.... increasingly immaterial,\\" commented Charles Lister, a military analyst at the Brookings Doha Centre. \\"Conflict on both sides of the border has become inherently interconnected.\\" Comparisons are now being made with the way the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan became irrelevant for al-Qaida. The effective erasure of the old border means that Isis can make tactical adjustments and new deployments in line with changing battlefield circumstances. It has acquired new strategic depth and more secure supply lines. Its enemies are already responding – on both sides of the frontier. According to reports from Lebanon, Iraqi Shia fighters who have been fighting in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad are heading home again to bolster Nouri al-Maliki, Iraq's prime minister, in his war against Isis and a wider Sunni insurgency. Iraq Shia militiamen deployed to Damascus to guard the revered Sayyida Zeinab shrine — along with Iranian revolutionary guards - are soon likely to be protecting the Shia holy places of Najaf and Karbala from Isis and other Sunni groups seeking to ignite a sectarian civil war. Many are with the Iraqi militia Asaib Ahl al-Haq, (League of the Righteous), an Iranian-backed force that is expected to spearhead the fightback against Isis. Men from the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah are filling the vacuum in Syria. In another twist in the fast-moving situation, last weekend the Syrian air force staged its first raids on Isis bases in Raqqa, Hassakeh and Deir al-Zor. That was noteworthy because Assad's enemies have often accused him of tolerating Isis or tacitly cooperating with it in order to split rebel ranks and present himself as a secular bulwark against al-Qaida and jihadi fanaticism. According to reports from Raqqa, Isis fighters inexplicably left their barracks 24 hours before the attack. In Deir al-Zor, planes seemed to fly in and out of Iraqi airspace, perhaps suggesting collaboration with Baghdad. The Syrian National Coalition, the main western-backed opposition group, quickly dismissed the raids as \\"a ridiculous decoy\\". Assad, it claimed, \\"aims through this fake air strike against limited Isis administrative centres to send a message to the international community and to rebuild trust with it, after its close relationship with Isis was exposed\\". Another more straightforward explanation, however, could be that developments in Iraq have forced the Syrian president to take the jihadis far more seriously than he appears to have done so far. It was hard, though to argue with the coalition leader, Ahmad Jarba, who on Wednesday described \\"a nightmarish reality threatening the entire region\\" and warned that the \\"bloodbath that started in Syria is spreading to Iraq and unfortunately, is just the tip of the iceberg\\". Isis, meanwhile, continues to reap propaganda benefits from its latest gains in Iraq. According to documents analysed by the US-based Institute for the Study of War, the group produces detailed annual reports on its operations and targets, presented with a clarity that speaks of clear state-building ambitions. It turns out that 2014 has been financially a very successful year, certainly helped by looting hundreds of millions of dollars from banks in Mosul – a haul one alarmed western diplomat described as \\"an absolute bonanza\\". Experts caution, however, that it is important to see the weaknesses of Isis as well as its formidable strengths. \\"While al-Qaida and its affiliates are embracing a more patient, locally focused strategy, Isis manifests a determination for rapid, dramatic results,\\" wrote Lister. \\"It's certainly just shown these in Iraq. But whether this will prove a more effective long-term strategy remains to be seen.\\" Summary:","completion":"ISIS has erased the border between Iraq and Syria, merging the two wars into one and further destabilizing the region. The group's control of territory in northeastern Syria has helped it to capture and maintain control of Mosul, Iraq's third-largest city. Money and arms flow easily across the border, enabling the group to claim that it is within reach of its goal of creating a new Muslim caliphate. The erasure of the border has led to comparisons with the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which became irrelevant for al-Qaida. As a result, both sides of the border have become interconnected, with the same conflict occurring on both sides. This has also made it easier for ISIS to adapt to changing battlefield circumstances and maintain secure supply lines. The merging of the two wars has led to increased violence and insecurity, as well as serious implications for the stability of the entire region."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] Rob is an environmental scientist. He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined. Which location's biodiversity loss likely to be permanent, location C or location D? Answer:","completion":"To determine which location's biodiversity loss is likely to be permanent between location C and location D, we need to analyze and compare various factors contributing to biodiversity loss in these regions and assess their potential for ecological restoration and resilience. 1. Causes of biodiversity loss: Biodiversity loss can result from several factors such as deforestation, pollution, climate change, over-exploitation of resources, invasive species, and habitat degradation or fragmentation. The permanence of biodiversity loss will largely depend on the primary causes affecting the region and their reversibility. - Location C: If the biodiversity loss in location C has resulted due to reversible factors such as natural disturbances (fires, storms, etc.), temporary pollution events, or proper management of invasive species, there is a possibility that the loss could be temporary. In this case, effective recovery efforts and sustainable management of the ecosystem could help in restoring the original biodiversity. - Location D (Entire globe): Biodiversity loss on a global scale is more complex and multi-faceted. Factors like climate change and habitat loss are widespread and have long-lasting effects, making it challenging to reverse biodiversity loss on a global scale. Moreover, global extinction of species is proven to be irreversible. In this context, global biodiversity loss leans more towards the permanent side. 2. Ecological restoration and resilience: The ability of an ecosystem to recover from disturbances and restore its original state may vary from region to region. - Location C: As the biodiversity loss in this location is yet to be determined, it is difficult to ascertain the recovery potential without more information about the specific circumstances. However, if the region exhibits high ecological resilience, it could potentially bounce back from the loss and regain its original biodiversity. - Location D (Entire globe): As mentioned earlier, global extinction of species is irreversible. While individual ecosystems across the globe might show some level of resilience, restoring biodiversity at the global scale is a much more challenging task, given the widespread and interrelated factors affecting biodiversity loss. Based on the analysis, it appears that the likelihood of permanent biodiversity loss is more significant for location D, the entire globe, compared to location C. This is because global biodiversity loss is more complex, and addressing the various causes and consequences requires extensive conservation efforts, many of which are yet to be implemented effectively. Meanwhile, location C could exhibit potential for ecological restoration and resilience, making it possible for biodiversity loss to be temporary, depending on the nature of influencing factors and successful recovery measures. Without further information regarding the specifics of location C, it is reasonable to conclude that location D is more likely to experience permanent biodiversity loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Alan took an early interest in gardening---first on his grandfather's Yorkshire allotment in Ilkley, and then in his parents' back garden. Small polythene greenhouses appeared in the back garden, and cacti were bought from church markets. Alan left school at fifteen with one \`O' level in Art and took a job as an apprentice gardener in Ilkley Parks Department nursery, studying for his City and Guilds in Horticulture in the evening. He went on to horticultural college at Oaklands in Hertfordshire where he studied for one year full-time, being awarded the National Certificate in Horticultural. This was followed by three years at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, resulting in the award of the Kew Diploma. After two years as supervisor of staff training at Kew, Alan entered journalism where he became first a gardening books editor, and then Deputy Editor of Amateur Gardening magazine. He appeared regularly on BBC Radio and Television in programs such as Nationwide , Breakfast Time, Open Air, Pebble Mill, Songs of Praise, Titchmarsh's Travels, and the Chelsea Flower Show. He presented the 100th edition of The Word for Channel 4, and hosted the quiz show Ask the Family. Gardeners' World and the hugely popular Ground Force, second only to Easterners in the BBC1 ratings, are broadcast as far as Australia, New Zealand and North America. After leaving both programs, Alan worked on two other series for the BBC to be transmitted in 2003 and 2004, one of them a landmark series on the natural history of Britain. Alan writes for the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Radio Times and BBC Gardeners' World magazine, and has more than thirty gardening books to his credit.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In the end, the money that towns across America gave General Motors did not matter. When the automaker released a list of factories it was closing during bankruptcy three years ago, communities that had considered themselves G.M.’s business partners were among the targets. For years, mayors and governors anxious about local jobs had agreed to G.M.’s demands for cash rewards, free buildings, worker training and lucrative tax breaks. As late as 2007, the company was telling local officials that these sorts of incentives would “further G.M.’s strong relationship” with them and be a “win/win situation,” according to town council notes from one Michigan community. Yet at least 50 properties on the 2009 liquidation list were in towns and states that had awarded incentives, adding up to billions in taxpayer dollars, according to data compiled by The New York Times. Some officials, desperate to keep G.M., offered more. Ohio was proposing a 56 million deal to save its Moraine plant, and Wisconsin, fighting for its Janesville factory, offered 153 million. But their overtures were to no avail. G.M. walked away and, thanks to a federal bailout, is once again profitable. The towns have not been so fortunate, having spent scarce funds in exchange for thousands of jobs that no longer exist. One township, Ypsilanti, Mich., is suing over the automaker’s departure. “You can’t just make these promises and throw them around like they’re spare change in the drawer,” said Doug Winters, the township’s attorney. Yet across the country, companies have been doing just that. And the giveaways are adding up to a gigantic bill for taxpayers. A Times investigation has examined and tallied thousands of local incentives granted nationwide and has found that states, counties and cities are giving up more than 80 billion each year to companies. The beneficiaries come from virtually every corner of the corporate world, encompassing oil and coal conglomerates, technology and entertainment companies, banks and big-box retail chains. The cost of the awards is certainly far higher. A full accounting, The Times discovered, is not possible because the incentives are granted by thousands of government agencies and officials, and many do not know the value of all their awards. Nor do they know if the money was worth it because they rarely track how many jobs are created. Even where officials do track incentives, they acknowledge that it is impossible to know whether the jobs would have been created without the aid. “How can you even talk about rationalizing what you’re doing when you don’t even know what you’re doing?” said Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich. The Times analyzed more than 150,000 awards and created a searchable database of incentive spending. The survey was supplemented by interviews with more than 100 officials in government and business organizations as well as corporate executives and consultants. A portrait arises of mayors and governors who are desperate to create jobs, outmatched by multinational corporations and short on tools to fact-check what companies tell them. Many of the officials said they feared that companies would move jobs overseas if they did not get subsidies in the United States. Over the years, corporations have increasingly exploited that fear, creating a high-stakes bazaar where they pit local officials against one another to get the most lucrative packages. States compete with other states, cities compete with surrounding suburbs, and even small towns have entered the race with the goal of defeating their neighbors. While some jobs have certainly migrated overseas, many companies receiving incentives were not considering leaving the country, according to interviews and incentive data. Despite their scale, state and local incentives have barely been part of the national debate on the economic crisis. The budget negotiations under way in Washington have not addressed whether the incentives are worth the cost, even though 20 percent of state and local budgets come from federal spending. Lawmakers in Washington are battling over possible increases in personal taxes, while both parties have said that lower federal taxes on corporations are needed for the country to compete globally. The Times analysis shows that Texas awards more incentives, over 19 billion a year, than any other state. Alaska, West Virginia and Nebraska give up the most per resident. For many communities, the payouts add up to a substantial chunk of their overall spending, the analysis found. Oklahoma and West Virginia give up amounts equal to about one-third of their budgets, and Maine allocates nearly a fifth. In a few states, the cost of incentives is not significant. But several of them have low business taxes — or none at all — which can save companies even more money than tax credits. Far and away the most incentive money is spent on manufacturing, about 25.5 billion a year, followed by agriculture. The oil, gas and mining industries come in third, and the film business fourth. Technology is not far behind, as companies like Twitter and Facebook increasingly seek tax breaks and many localities bet on the industry’s long-term viability. Those hopes were once more focused on automakers, which for decades have pushed cities and states to set up incentive programs, blazing a trail that companies of all sorts followed. Even today, G.M. is the top beneficiary, public records indicate. It received at least 1.7 billion in local incentives in the last five years, followed closely by Ford and Chrysler. A spokesman for General Motors said that almost every major employer applied for incentives because they help keep companies competitive and retain or create jobs. “There are many reasons why so many Ford, Chrysler and G.M. plants closed over the last few decades,” said the G.M. spokesman, James Cain. “But these factors don’t mean that the companies and communities didn’t benefit while the plants were open, which was often for generations.” Mr. Cain cited research showing that the company received less money per job than foreign automakers operating in the United States. Questioned about incentives, officials at dozens of other large corporations said they owed it to shareholders to maximize profits. Many emphasized that they employ thousands of Americans who pay taxes and spend money in the local economy. For government officials like Bobby Hitt of South Carolina, the incentives are a good investment that will raise tax revenues in the long run. “I don’t see it as giving up anything,” said Mr. Hitt, who worked at BMW in the 1990s and helped it win 130 million from South Carolina. Today, Mr. Hitt is the state’s secretary of commerce. South Carolina recently took on a 218 million debt to assist Boeing’s expansion there and offered the company tax breaks for 10 years. Mr. Hitt, like most political officials, has a short-term mandate. It will take years to see whether the state’s bet on Boeing bears fruit. In Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican in his first term, has been working to eliminate most business tax credits but is bound by past awards. The state gave General Motors 779 million in credits in 2009, just a month after the company received a 50 billion federal bailout and decided to close seven plants in Michigan. G.M. can use the credits to offset its state tax bill for up to 20 years. “You don’t know who will take a credit or when,” said Doug Smith, a senior official at the state’s economic development agency. “We may give a credit to G.M., and they might not take it for three years or 10 years or more.” One corporate executive, Donald J. Hall Jr. of Hallmark, thinks business subsidies are hurting his hometown, Kansas City, Mo., by diverting money from public education. “It’s really not creating new jobs,” Mr. Hall said. “It’s motivated by politicians who want to claim they have brought new jobs into their state.” For Mr. Hall and others in Kansas City, the futility of free-flowing incentives has been underscored by a border war between Kansas and Missouri. Soon after Kansas recruited AMC Entertainment with a 36 million award last year, the state cut its education budget by 104 million. AMC was moving only a few miles, across the border from Missouri. Workers saw little change other than in commuting times and office décor. A few months later, Missouri lured Applebee’s headquarters from Kansas. “I just shake my head every time it happens, it just gives me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach,” said Sean O’Byrne, the vice president of the Downtown Council of Kansas City. “It sounds like I’m talking myself out of a job, but there ought to be a law against what I’m doing.” Outgunned by Companies For local governments, incentives have become the cost of doing business with almost every business. The Times found that the awards go to companies big and small, those gushing in profits and those sinking in losses, American companies and foreign companies, and every industry imaginable. Workers are a vital ingredient in any business, yet companies and government officials increasingly view the creation of jobs as an expense that should be subsidized by taxpayers, private consultants and local officials said. Even big retailers and hotels, whose business depends on being in specific locations, bargain for incentives as if they can move anywhere. The same can be said for many movie productions, which almost never come to town without local subsidies. When Oliver Stone made the 2010 sequel to “Wall Street,” in his mind there was only one place to shoot it: New York City. Nonetheless, the film, a scathing look at bankers’ greed, received 10 million in tax credits, according to 20th Century Fox. In an interview, Mr. Stone criticized subsidies for industries like banking and agriculture but defended them for Hollywood, saying that many movies can be shot anywhere and that their actors and crew members pay state income taxes. “It’s good,” Mr. Stone said of the film subsidies. “Or like basically the way business is done. I don’t understand what the moral qualm is.” The practical consequences can be easily seen. The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative group, found that the amount New York spends on film credits every year equals the cost of hiring 5,000 public-school teachers. Nationwide, billions of dollars in incentives are being awarded as state governments face steep deficits. Last year alone, states cut public services and raised taxes by a collective 156 billion, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning advocacy group. Incentives come in many forms: cash grants and loans; sales tax breaks; income tax credits and exemptions; free services; and property tax abatements. The income tax breaks add up to 18 billion and sales tax relief around 52 billion of the overall 80 billion in incentives. Collecting data on property tax abatements is the most difficult because only a handful of states track the amounts given by cities and counties. Among them is New York, where businesses save an estimated 1.1 billion a year in property taxes. The American International Group, the insurance company at the center of the 2008 financial crisis, continued to benefit from a 23.8 million abatement from New York City at the same time it was being bailed out with 180 billion in federal money. Since 2000, The New York Times Company has received more than 24 million from the city and state. In some places, local officials have little choice but to answer the demands of corporations. “They dictate their terms, and we’re not really in a position to question their deal terms,” Sarah Eckhardt, a commissioner in Travis County, Tex., said of companies she has dealt with recently, including Apple and Hewlett-Packard. “We don’t have the sophistication or the resources to negotiate with a company that has the wherewithal the size of a country. We are just no match in negotiating with that.” Local officials can find themselves across the table from conglomerates like Shell Oil and Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment. Shell has been offered a tax credit worth as much as 1.6 billion over 25 years from Pennsylvania, which competed with West Virginia and Ohio for an energy production facility. Royal Dutch Shell, the parent company, made 31 billion in profits in 2011 — about 3.5 million every hour. The company’s chief executive made 13.1 million last year, according to Equilar, an executive compensation firm. Pennsylvania predicts that the plant will create thousands of long-term jobs, but it did not require them in exchange for the tax credit. Caterpillar has received more than 196 million in local aid nationwide since 2007, though it has chastised states, particularly its home base, Illinois, for not being business-friendly. This year, Caterpillar announced a new plant in Georgia, which offered 44 million in incentives. Local counties chipped in free land and other aid, including 15 million in tax breaks and 8.2 million in road, water and sewer repairs. The company, whose profits are soaring, recently froze workers’ pay for six years at several locations, arguing that it needed to remain competitive. A spokesman for the company, Jim Dugan, said it employed more than 50,000 people and invested billions of dollars nationwide. Local officials typically have scant information about the track record of corporations, like whether they lived up to job assurances elsewhere. And some officials acknowledged that they did not know to what extent incentives were a deciding factor for companies. “I don’t know that there’s a way to know other than talking to the businesses, and the businesses telling us that that was a factor in creating jobs,” said Ken Striplin, the city manager of Santa Clarita, Calif., which gives tax breaks in a designated enterprise zone. “There’s no box that says ‘I would have created this job without the enterprise zone.’ ” California is one of the few states that have been cutting back on incentives. But that does not mean its cities are following suit. When Twitter threatened to leave San Francisco last year, officials scrambled to assuage the company. Twitter was not short on money — it soon received a 300 million investment from a Saudi prince and 800 million from a private consortium. The two received Twitter equity, but San Francisco got a different sort of deal. The city exempted Twitter from what could total 22 million in payroll taxes, and the company agreed to stay put. The city estimates that Twitter’s work force could grow to 2,600 employees, although the company made no such promise. A Twitter spokeswoman said the company was “very happy to have been able to stay in San Francisco.” City officials did not respond to inquiries. Like many places, San Francisco has been cutting its budget. Public parks have lost about 12 million in recent years, though workers at Twitter will not lack for greenery. The company’s plush new office has a rooftop garden with great views and amenities. Enjoying the perks, one employee sent out a tweet: “Tanned on Twitter’s new roof deck this morning as some dude served me smoothie shots. This is real life?” A Zero-Sum Game It was the company every state had to have. In 1985, General Motors was looking for a spot to manufacture its Saturn, a new compact car that would compete with Japanese imports and create thousands of American jobs. Incentives were not in wide use, and several states had only recently begun to allow more of them. In fact, when G.M. announced the search, its chairman, Roger Smith, said the perks would not be a predominant factor. “Tax breaks can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear,” Mr. Smith told The Detroit Free Press. He said G.M. planned to avoid states that had large debts or lackluster schools. Undeterred, some 30 states stepped forward in what became a full-out competition. One official, Bill Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, traveled to Detroit offering income tax credits and sales tax exemptions worth nearly 200 million. Mr. Smith essentially kept his word and chose Tennessee, which had put together a relatively small package. Reid Rundell, a retired G.M. executive, said in a recent interview that it had come down to geography. “The primary factor was distribution for incoming parts, as well as outgoing vehicles,” Mr. Rundell said. But the gates had been opened. In 1992, South Carolina lured BMW with a 130 million package; the next year, Alabama got Mercedes-Benz at a price tag that topped 300 million. “What the auto incentives did back then was really raise the profile of economic incentives both within companies, in government and in the public’s eye,” said Mark Sweeney, who worked for the South Carolina Commerce Department in the 1990s and now advises companies on obtaining government grants. By 1993, governors were regaling one another at a national conference with stories of deals beyond the auto industry, including a recent bidding war for United Airlines that drew more than 90 cities. The airline had set up negotiations in a hotel, and its representatives ran floor to floor comparing bids, said Jim Edgar, then the governor of Illinois. Mr. Edgar said he had called for a truce, concerned that the practice was unfair to companies that did not receive incentives. But many states would not sign on, he said, particularly those in the South, where businesses were moving. “If you’ve got some states doing it, it’s hard for the others not to do it,” Mr. Edgar said. “It’s like unilaterally disarming.” Soon after, economists at Federal Reserve branches were questioning the use of incentives. One, in Minnesota, used mathematical proofs and game theory to show that competition between states did not increase overall economic value. Several other economists have since called the practice a zero-sum game. A group of taxpayers in Michigan and Ohio went as far as suing DaimlerChrysler after Ohio and the City of Toledo awarded the automaker 280 million in the late 1990s. The suit argued that it was unfair for one taxpayer to be given a break at the expense of all others. The suit made its way to the Supreme Court, and G.M. and Ford signed on to briefs supporting Daimler, as did local governments. The National Governors Association warned the court that prohibiting incentives could lead to jobs moving overseas. “This is the economic reality,” the association said in a brief. The governors offered no hard evidence of the effectiveness of tax credits, but the Supreme Court did not consider whether they worked anyway. In 2006, the court concluded that the taxpayers did not have the legal standing to challenge Ohio’s tax actions in federal court. The tab for auto incentives has grown to 13.9 billion since 1985, according to the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit group in Ann Arbor, Mich. G.M., the top recipient, was awarded 3.3 billion of the aid. Since 1979, automakers also closed more than 267 plants in the United States, about half of which still sit empty, according to the center. The auto industry and some local officials have long argued that auto companies create so many jobs and draw in so many supporting suppliers that all taxpayers benefit. Even if companies shut down years later, as Saturn did in Tennessee for a few years, the trade-off is worth it, they said. “I do believe that if a state ever is going to create incentives,” said Lamar Alexander, who was Tennessee’s governor in 1985 when Saturn selected the state, “the auto industry would be by far the No. 1 target, because an auto assembly plant is a money target.” Still, Mr. Alexander, now a United States senator, said that recruiting a large factory today would be more expensive. “It has changed a lot,” he said. “It’s almost become a sweepstakes.” G.M. Gets Into the Act G.M. may have initially minimized the role of local dollars, but as the company’s financial problems grew, incentives became a big part of its math. The actions of the company were described in more than two dozen in-depth interviews with former company officials, tax consultants and governors and mayors who have dealt with G.M. The automaker’s real estate division, Argonaut Realty, oversaw the hunt for the most lucrative deals. Up and down the corporate ladder, employees were encouraged to push governments for more, according to transcripts of public meetings and interviews. Even G.M. plant managers knew that the future of their facilities depended in part on their ability to send word of big discounts back to Detroit. Union representatives were enlisted to attend local hearings, putting a human face on the jobs at stake. G.M.’s regional tax managers often showed up, armed with tax abatement wish lists and highlighting the company’s gifts to local charities. “We knew what our investment of X amount meant to the community, and we knew we needed to partner with the community to be successful,” said Marilyn P. Nix, who worked as a real estate executive at G.M. for 31 years until retiring in 2005. At the top of G.M., executives reviewed the proposals from various locations and went where the numbers added up. “I know people like to blame the industry for taking advantage of the incentives, but you go back to what your fiduciary responsibility is to the stockholders,” Ms. Nix said. “As long as you’ve got people that are willing to better the deals, the management owes it to their stockholders to try to get the best economic deal that they can.” For towns, it became a game of survival, even if the competition turned out to be a mirage. Moraine, Ohio, was already home to a G.M. plant in 1997 when the company pushed hard for additional incentives. G.M. said it was looking for a place to accommodate more manufacturing. Wayne Barfels, the city manager at the time, said a G.M. representative had told officials that Moraine was competing with Shreveport, La., and Linden, N.J. After the local school board approved property tax breaks, The Dayton Daily News reported that the other towns had not been in discussions with G.M. The school board considered rescinding the deal, but allowed G.M. to keep it after a company official apologized. In 2008, G.M. shut the Moraine facility. In towns where General Motors remains, local officials praised the company. “I can say they have been a great partner to us,” said Virg Bernero, the mayor of Lansing, Mich. “It would do something to the psyche of this community if they were not here. I mean, I just praise God every day.” Looking to lure businesses beyond automakers, states have routinely bolstered their incentive tool kits. In 2010 alone, states created or expanded about 40 tax credits and exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The nature of the credits has also changed. New ones are geared toward attracting technology and green energy companies, but it is hard to know whether 15 years down the road they will thrive or wind up stumbling like the automakers. And many modern companies, like those in digital technology, can easily pack up and leave. “I don’t see anything that suggests that Twitter and Facebook are better bets in the long run,” said Laura A. Reese, the director of the Global Urban Studies Program at Michigan State University. Ms. Reese advises local governments to invest in residents through education and training rather than in companies where “it’s hard to pick winners.” Yet states try to do it all the time. In 2010, Rhode Island, which has the nation’s second-highest unemployment rate, recruited Curt Schilling, a former Red Sox pitcher, to move his video game company from Massachusetts. The company, 38 Studios, had never released a game and was not making money, but the governor at the time had the state guarantee 75 million in loans. The company failed and dismissed all of its roughly 400 workers this May. Rhode Island taxpayers are now on the hook for the loans. Officials said part of the difficulty was that communities do not get much say in a company’s business strategy. “We, as communities, stake our futures with these people who are supposed to know what they’re doing, and sometimes they don’t,” said Arthur Walker, a businessman in Shreveport and former chairman of the city’s chamber of commerce. Mr. Walker and other officials in Shreveport know firsthand. In 2000, they were worried that G.M. would close a plant in their area and responded with a generous proposal: the city would cut the company’s gas bill and provide work force training grants. In addition, G.M. would benefit by a recent increase in one of the state’s income tax credits. Eager to encourage innovation, Shreveport officials suggested ways the city could assist G.M. in building electric cars. “We wanted to be part of the future,” said Mr. Walker, whose brother worked at the plant. G.M. took the city’s incentives but not its business advice and began building the giant Hummer there. “We knew they needed to build green cars — I mean, who builds a Hummer for the 21st century?” Mr. Walker said. “It was a losing proposition that we found ourselves in. We couldn’t win because those people weren’t making the correct business decisions, in my view. When it didn’t work, we’re the ones left holding the bag.” The Hummer was discontinued in 2010, and the Shreveport factory closed this August, the final victim of G.M.’s bankruptcy. Ypsilanti’s Losing Battle For much of the last 20 years, Doug Winters has been agitating for General Motors to be held accountable. Mr. Winters, the attorney for Ypsilanti Township and several other places around Ann Arbor, has lived in Ypsilanti all his life. His grandmother labored at the local plant, Willow Run, during World War II, when it made bomber planes. People in town still proudly point out that a woman known as Rosie the Riveter worked there as well. After the war, when G.M. moved into the plant to manufacture its automatic transmission system, his father got a job. Mr. Winters loves the history of Willow Run but hates what he views as corporate hypocrisy: G.M. asked for government help on the one hand and then appealed to free-market rationales for closing shop. Over the years, Ypsilanti granted G.M. more than 200 million in incentives for two factories at Willow Run, Mr. Winters said. “They had put basically a stranglehold on the entire state of Michigan and other places across the country by just grabbing these tax abatements by the billions,” he said. “They were doing it with a very thinly disguised threat that if you don’t give us these tax abatements, then we’ll have to go somewhere else.” Ypsilanti first sued G.M. in the 1990s to prevent the company from closing the factory at Willow Run that made the Chevrolet Caprice. The town had granted the company tax incentives after the factory manager argued that G.M.’s ability to compete with other carmakers was at stake, documents in the lawsuit show. The tax break and “favorable market demand,” said the plant manager, Harvey Williams, would allow the automaker to “maintain continuous employment.” Nevertheless, G.M. shut the factory. A lower court found in favor of Ypsilanti, but the ruling was reversed on appeal. The judge said that a company’s job assurances “cannot be evidence of a promise.” In 2010, when the company closed the remaining factory at Willow Run, Mr. Winters sued again. This time, Ypsilanti argued that the automaker should have been forced to close overseas factories instead, especially since American taxpayers had bailed out G.M. In addition, Ypsilanti sought to recover money from G.M., saying the company had agreed to reimburse the town for some incentives if it left. So far, Ypsilanti’s claims have not been addressed. They were complicated by G.M.’s bankruptcy, which allowed the carmaker to emerge as a new company and leave some of its liabilities and contractual obligations behind. When asked whether the new G.M. has civic responsibilities to its former factory towns, Mr. Cain, the company spokesman, said: “Our obligation to the communities where we do business is to run a successful business. And when we prosper, it allows us to do more than just turn the lights on and make cars.” He also said that since the bailout, “G.M. has invested more than 7.3 billion in its U.S. facilities, and we’ve created or retained almost 19,000 jobs in communities all over the country.” Matthew P. Cullen, who oversaw real estate and economic development for G.M. until he left the company in 2008, said the automaker was aware of its impact on communities. He said that what happened with G.M. was the result of an entire industry changing and that there had been no bad intentions. “If you go forward in good faith doing everything you can and make the investment, then you’re partners,” Mr. Cullen said. “Sometimes partnerships in business work, and they work for 60 years. And in some cases, they don’t, and it doesn’t make you a bad partner.” Some towns that are still dealing with the fallout of plant closings might disagree. In Pontiac, Mich., tax revenues have fallen 40 percent since 2009 after the old G.M. knocked down buildings on its property, resulting in lower tax assessments, according to the city’s emergency manager. In Ypsilanti, an entity set up to sell off G.M. property is marketing the plant as valuable. At the same time, it has been arguing for lower property taxes on the grounds that its plant is not worth much. Ypsilanti’s supervisor, Brenda Stumbo, said the township would be stung hard by further revenue cuts. Ypsilanti has already slimmed down its Fire Department, and city workers are juggling multiple jobs. There are seven to 10 home foreclosures a week, giving the township the highest foreclosure rate in the county, Ms. Stumbo said. “Can all of it be traced back to General Motors?” she said, listing auto suppliers that closed after G.M. did. “No, but a great deal of it can.” Nonetheless, Ms. Stumbo said that if G.M. would bring jobs back to town, she would be willing to grant the company more incentives. But Mr. Winters is not so sure. He said he would never support more incentives without stronger protections for Ypsilanti. “They’ve done a lot of damage to a lot of people and a lot of communities, and they’ve basically been given a clean slate,” he said. “It’s a ‘get out of jail free’ card.” ||||| The Times identified 48 companies that have received more than 100 million in state grants since 2007.

Movie title: Man on a Ledge Movie plot: In New York City, Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) checks in to the Roosevelt Hotel under the false name of Walker, goes to his hotel room on the 21st floor, and climbs on the ledge, apparently ready to commit suicide. The crowd below calls the police, with Dante Marcus (Titus Welliver) controlling the crowd, while Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns) tries to talk with Nick. However, Nick will only speak to negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), who is on a leave of absence, after failing to save a suicidal policeman. Lydia arrives at the hotel room and manages to acquire Nick's fingerprints from a cigarette they share. Dougherty has them analyzed and discovers that Nick is an ex-policeman, arrested for stealing the 40 million Monarch diamond from businessman David Englander (Ed Harris). Nick was given a 25-year sentence but escaped from the Sing Sing Correctional Facility one month earlier, after being allowed to attend his father's funeral. Nick, however, maintains his innocence and accuses Englander of framing him for the theft of the diamond, as Englander lost his fortune and was too proud to sell the diamond. Unknown to the police, Nick is merely distracting them while his brother, Joey (Jamie Bell), and Joey's girlfriend, Angie (GÃ©nesis RodrÃ­guez), break into Englander's vault across the street, to steal the diamond and prove Nick's innocence. Meanwhile, Dougherty informs Marcus of Nick's identity, and Marcus orders the jewelry store's security to check the vault. Joey and Angie are able to evade them but do not find the diamond. They set off the alarms, tricking Englander into retrieving the diamond and ambush him, stealing the diamond at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Nick's ex-partner, Mike Ackerman (Anthony Mackie), arrives at the hotel with evidence that Nick is planning something and demands to be allowed into the hotel room. Lydia does not trust him, and Dougherty backs her up. Ackerman claims he has found bomb schematics in a storage unit Nick rented and is convinced that he will detonate an explosive... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Ackerman was wounded by his own actions and decisions. Throughout the movie, it is revealed that Mike Ackerman (Anthony Mackie) played a significant role in framing Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) for the theft of the Monarch diamond. Ackerman's betrayal of his former partner and friend led to his ultimate downfall. As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Ackerman is working with businessman David Englander (Ed Harris) to frame Nick for the theft of the diamond. This partnership places him in a precarious situation as he is constantly trying to cover up his involvement in the crime and mislead the police. Ackerman's wounds are a result of his own betrayal and deceit, both figuratively and literally. Figuratively, as he suffers from immense guilt and the strain of trying to maintain his cover throughout the movie; as well as the consequences of his actions coming back to haunt him. Literally, as he is eventually injured during the final confrontation between himself, Nick, and the police in the film. In summary, Ackerman's wounds are a direct result of his actions and decisions throughout the film, showing that his betrayal and deceit ultimately led to his downfall. This serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of dishonesty and the impact it can have on relationships and one's own well-being."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Samuel has always been inclined towards ethical considerations in all aspects of his life, including leisure activities like poker. He perceives the outcome of the game as less important than the fair conduct and experience shared among the participants. This is a direct contrast to Neil, who prioritizes winning at all costs, even if it implicates employing dishonest tactics. Having grown up in a family that nurtured a strong moral compass, Samuel internalized the values of honesty, respect, and accountability from a young age. He understood that these virtues extended beyond just vital life decisions and were, in fact, applicable to something as trivial as a card game. Samuel often found himself at odds with Neil's cheating ways but chose to let it slide as long as it didn't completely ruin the game for others. In social circles where poker is played frequently, Samuel's unbiased stance and adherence to the rules have earned him the reputation of a fair and trustworthy player. His friends and acquaintances have come to admire his resilience to temptation and his unwavering code of ethics. On the other hand, Neil's knack for cheating has made some players wary of playing against him, tainting the atmosphere with suspicion and tension. These divergent approaches to the game have not only illuminated the core values of the two individuals but also serve as a reflection of their broader life philosophies. Samuel, with his commitment to fairness and integrity, approaches challenges and relationships with respect and sincerity. Neil, conversely, often adopts a more Machiavellian outlook, prioritizing his personal gain or advantage over the interests of others.

Context: Just minutes after Donald Trump fired Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, the president was blunt about his long-standing differences with his former secretary of state. “We disagreed on things,” Trump told reporters outside the White House, specifically pointing to friction over the Iran nuclear agreement. “I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently,” Trump said. “We were really not thinking the same.” Trump reportedly had considered firing Tillerson for months. But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Write a title for this article: Researchers have combed beaches and ocean floors looking for compounds that can be effective antibiotics, a process that's assumed greater urgency as untreatable superbugs appear more frequently. Now they’re targeting a new location: your nose. Scientists at the University of Tübingen in Germany have found an antibiotic made by a nasal bacterium that can kill Staphylococcus aureus, the source of many human infections. Existing antibiotics have been unable to kill its various strains, most notably MRSA, which can cause deadly sepsis and pneumonia. This gives the new antibiotic, which they call lugdunin, the potential to aid new treatments of bacterial infections. Lugdunin has been shown to fight a range of bacteria and treat skin infections in mice, according to an article published on Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature. Not only does it combat MRSA, it does so while being less likely to cause a patient to develop resistance. Overuse of antibiotics has played an outsized role in making such drugs ineffective for a broad swath of existing treatments. As part of their discovery, the authors also illustrate a novel method of using human microorganisms to develop antibiotics. “We’ve come up with a new concept,” said Andreas Peschel, one of the paper's 17 authors. “It was totally unexpected to find a human-associated bacterium to produce a real antibiotic.” Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria such as MRSA, which kills 20,000 Americans each year, are of growing concern for clinicians and microbiologists because of their ability to lead to pandemics. Superbugs already kill 700,000 people around the world annually, a number that researchers predict (PDF) could reach 10 million by 2050. “It’s such a huge problem that we expect in 10 years more people to die from these diseases than cancer,” Peschel said of diseases such as those derived from MRSA. The authors of the new study looked at nasal swabs from 187 hospital patients and found that only 5.9 percent of those with the Staphylococcus lugdunensis bacterium, which produces lugdunin, also had the unwanted Staphylococcus aureus. By comparison, some 34.7 percent of patients who didn't have the lugdunin-producing bacterium had Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, researchers showed that, within 72 hours of its introduction, lugdunin led to a strong reduction or killed Staphylococcus aureus on the surface and in deeper layers of the skin of most mice. The authors said they're unsure how Staphylococcus aureus could become resistant to lugdunin. Peschel said, based on their findings, that such resistance “seems very difficult, if not impossible.” Another advantage of the antibiotic is that it keeps its full activity within the human body, said co-author Bernhard Krismer, potentially making it more effective than compounds derived elsewhere. However, there's a drawback: Since it's the first non-ribosomal peptide antibiotic, meaning that it is not synthesized using DNA or RNA, scientists would have a more difficult time modifying it for research or drug development. Peschel said that researchers have filed a patent application to begin negotiations with pharmaceutical companies, though they're several years from starting clinical trials. While a new antibiotic is always welcome in these times of diminishing drug effectiveness, what may be more important is the discovery that the tools to fight fearsome superbugs could lie within our own bodies. “We are sure there will be additional antibiotics that can be discovered from these sources,” Peschel said.

The tires at that point experienced What's the answer?","completion":"Answer: The tires experienced a loss of traction, and the resulting skid created increased friction. When a vehicle rounds a corner and slips, creating a squealing noise, the tires have experienced a sudden loss of traction. This occurs when the lateral (sideways) force experienced by the tires exceeds the traction limit, causing the tires to slide across the road surface instead of maintaining proper grip. Different factors like speed, road conditions, tire quality, and vehicle suspension can affect the level of traction a tire has with the road surface. The reason for the squealing noise is the vibration of the rubber as it rapidly slips and grips the surface in small increments, generating both sound and friction. Friction is the force that opposes the motion of objects in contact with each other, and it is directly proportional to the force with which the objects are pressed together. In this case, the frictional force is between the tires and the road surface. During a skid, the friction between the tires and the road is not static but kinetic, meaning it involves movement. Kinetic friction is generally lower than static friction, which is the friction experienced when objects are not in motion relative to each other. As the tires lose grip and start skidding, the kinetic friction increases as the tire scrubs against the road surface. This friction generates heat and gradually wears down the tire rubber, reducing its potential grip for future use. The increased friction and resulting heat can also lead to a slight meltdown of the tire rubber, which may cause it to become tacky and increase the traction momentarily. This alternation between slipping and increased grip results in the squealing sound that is commonly associated with a skidding vehicle. It is worth mentioning that maintaining control of the vehicle during a skid is crucial, as losing control can lead to accidents and injuries. Drivers should educate themselves on proper skid recovery techniques and practice them to ensure safe vehicle operation in all conditions. In summary, a vehicle rounding a corner and then slipping with a squealing noise indicates a loss of traction, with the tires experiencing increased kinetic friction as they skid across the road surface. This friction generates heat and wear on the tires and can result in alternating grip levels that produce the characteristic squealing sound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"A boy is swinging a stick at a pinata while a woman and little girl look on.\\" true if \\"The boy is tall for his age\\"? A. yes; B. it is not possible to tell; C. no;","completion":"A. Yes The premise, \\"A boy is swinging a stick at a pinata while a woman and little girl look on,\\" can still be true even if the boy is tall for his age. The statement about the boy's height does not contradict or change the original premise. The boy being tall for his age is simply an additional detail describing one of the characters in the scene. It does not interfere with or negate the action taking place – that is, the boy swinging a stick at a pinata. Similarly, the woman and little girl observing the activity remain unaltered by this new information. Furthermore, the statement about the boy's height does not introduce any uncertainty or ambiguity to the original premise. The presence of a tall boy does not imply that the pinata is unreachable, nor does it suggest that the woman and little girl would not be present to watch the event. In fact, the boy's height might even make it easier for him to hit the pinata. Overall, the original premise remains true regardless of whether or not the boy is tall for his age. The statement simply adds a descriptive aspect to the scene, enriching the mental picture without altering the core elements of the situation.

How do I recover my lost Gmail password if I don't have the same number and don't remember the recovery email? I forgot my Gmail password and I can't answer the Gmail recovery questions. What can I do?","completion":"On the surface, these two questions may appear to be the same, as both questions are related to recovering a lost Gmail password. However, they are actually different because they focus on different aspects of the recovery process and mention different obstacles faced by the user in their attempts to regain access to their account. Here's a more in-depth analysis of each question: 1. \\"How do I recover my lost Gmail password if I don't have the same number and don't remember the recovery email?\\" In this question, the user is looking for a solution to recover their lost Gmail password, with the specific issue being that they do not have access to their registered phone number and do not remember their recovery email address. This may be caused by a variety of factors, such as them changing their phone number or not using their recovery email account frequently. The user is looking for a solution that takes into account these limitations and helps them regain access to their Gmail account without requiring a phone number or recovery email address. Possible solutions for this issue could be obtaining a new SIM card with the same phone number, contacting Google support, or attempting to remember or find the recovery email address by searching in other email accounts or using online search tools. 2. \\"I forgot my Gmail password and I can't answer the Gmail recovery questions. What can I do?\\" In this question, the user has also forgotten their Gmail password, but they are specifically unable to answer the security questions that are part of the Gmail password recovery process. The user may not remember the answers to their security questions or may feel that the questions are too difficult to answer. The user is looking for a solution that can help them regain access to their Gmail account without relying on the security questions. Some possible solutions for this issue might include using alternative account recovery options, like a recovery email address or a registered phone number, or contacting Google support and providing them with additional proof of account ownership, such as information on recent emails and contacts. In conclusion, while both questions are ultimately about recovering a lost Gmail password, they present different obstacles that the user is facing, with the first question focusing on not having access to a phone number or recovery email address, and the second question concerning an inability to answer security questions. The solutions and advice provided for each scenario will differ accordingly, taking into account the different factors at play in each of the questions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members.

It can be difficult to make a distinction between this form of corruption and some forms of extreme and loosely regulated lobbying where for instance law- or decision-makers can freely \\"sell\\" their vote, decision power or influence to those lobbyists who offer the highest compensation, including where for instance the latter act on behalf of powerful clients such as industrial groups who want to avoid the passing of specific environmental, social, or other regulations perceived as too stringent, etc. Where lobbying is (sufficiently) regulated, it becomes possible to provide for a distinctive criteria and to consider that trading in influence involves the use of \\"improper influence\\", as in article 12 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173) of the Council of Europe. Now answer this question: Where lobbying is controlled, what does it provide for consideration to determine improper influencing?","completion":"Where lobbying is controlled, it provides distinctive criteria for consideration to determine improper influencing. This is based on regulated frameworks set by authorities, which help differentiate between legitimate lobbying practices and improper influence in decision-making processes. It helps to prevent corruption and ensures transparency and accountability in the way lobbying is conducted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

William Henry ('Harry') Pilkington, Baron Pilkington (1905–1983) was a glass manufacturer and former President of the Federation of British Industries but who is remembered politically as chairman of the Pilkington Committee that produced the controversial Pilkington Report of 1962. He was also Chancellor of Loughborough University from 1966 to 1980. Can we infer the following? William was a former political leader","completion":"Based on the information provided, William Henry ('Harry') Pilkington, Baron Pilkington, was indeed a significant figure in the British glass manufacturing industry and made notable contributions, particularly in the context of the Pilkington Committee and its report. However, it would not be accurate to classify him as a \\"political leader\\" in the conventional sense. While Pilkington did hold several important positions, his primary domain was within the industry and education sectors rather than politics. It is important to distinguish between someone who holds political office and someone who plays a role in shaping policies or regulations from outside the political sphere. Firstly, as a glass manufacturer, his primary focus was on his business and the industry. He cofounded and led Pilkington Glass, which became one of the most successful global glass companies. Through his work at the company, he undoubtedly wielded influence over policies and regulations affecting the British glass industry. However, his role was more closely associated with the business and industrial world rather than direct political involvement. Secondly, his role as President of the Federation of British Industries further supports his connections to the business world rather than being a political leader. The Federation of British Industries was a trade association, and while these organizations undoubtedly have an impact on policy, they are distinct from political institutions in that they primarily cater to the interests of their member industries and businesses. Thirdly, his work with the Pilkington Committee certainly demonstrates his influence on broadcasting policy in the UK. However, the Pilkington Report was produced by a committee of experts in various fields to provide recommendations about the future of British broadcasting rather than being part of a political party or government policy-making body. Pilkington served as the chairman of this committee, reinforcing his role more as a leader in policy discussions rather than a political leader. Lastly, his position as Chancellor of Loughborough University between 1966 and 1980 emphasizes his commitment to education. This role allowed him to have an impact on the academic sphere, but again, it did not constitute a direct political position. In summary, while William Henry ('Harry') Pilkington, Baron Pilkington, was an influential figure in various sectors such as industry, education, and policy-making, particularly in the realm of broadcasting, he was not a political leader in a traditional sense. His work shaped policies and regulations in his capacity as a business leader and policy expert, but he did not hold formal political office or pursue a political career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This article: Blonde on Blonde is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released June 20, 1966 on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—\\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded. Blonde on Blonde completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited. Critics often rank Blonde on Blonde as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called \\"a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial\\". It was one of the first double albums in rock music. The album peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, where it eventually was certified double platinum, and it reached number three in the UK. Blonde on Blonde spawned two singles that were top-twenty hits in the US: \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\\" and \\"I Want You\\". Two additional songs—\\"Just Like a Woman\\" and \\"Visions of Johanna\\"—have been named as among Dylan's greatest compositions and were featured in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. contains an answer for the question: What are the first names of the three people who moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee?, what is it ?","completion":"The first names of the three people who moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee are Bob, Al, and Robbie.

Question: Why does Joe tie Frida to a chair? Movie title: ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction Movie plot: Opening on a beach of the island town of Port Gamble, a blind resident discovers a rotting zombie washed up in the sand.Frida Abbas (Janette Armand) is a teenage Irianian-American girl has returned to Port Gamble, her home town after dropping out of Princeton University. She runs into her neighbor, Joe Miller, at the local gas station which he runs with his wife, Judy, and their teenage son, Brian. The family refers to her as Iraqi, much to Frida' confusion.Meanwhile, the token gay couple, Tom Hunt (Doug Fahl) and Lance Murphy (Cooper Hopkins) arrive in Port Gamble to tell Tom's mother that he is gay. While Tom and Lance explore town, many island residents appear to have been zombified, including a police officer. Frida arrives at her house to find her father, Ali, praying. Ali has a lecturing argument to Frida about being more proud of her Iranian heritage. Frida sneaks out of the house with her boyfriend, Derek (Ryan Barret).Tom and Lance are having dinner with Tom's mother, who reveals that she was bitten earlier by a bystander at the store. She goes into the kitchen to prepare dessert and Tom admits that he is gay at the second his mom becomes a zombie and attacks them. Lance pins her to the wall with a fireplace poker and discovers more zombies walking towards the house. The news reveals that Port Gamble is under attack by a bio-terrorism attack which turns it's victims into zombies.While Frida and Derek are outside, Derek's face is horrifically ripped off and eaten by a zombie. Ali leaves the house to look for his daughter while Frida escapes from a group of zombies and returns to her abandoned and surrounded house. Judy calls for her from her barricaded home. Frida and Judy run and hide in the basement with Brian and Joe. Judy is bitten by a zombie while helping Frida inside.While watching the news on a TV set, Joe sees that the terrorist responsible for the outbreak is wearing the same necklace as Frida. He ties Frida to a chair and asks her questions about U.S. history, much to Brian's disgust. Tom...","completion":"In the movie ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction, Joe ties Frida to a chair because he suspects her of being involved in the terrorist attack that has caused the zombie outbreak in their town. This suspicion arises when Joe notices that Frida is wearing the same necklace as the terrorist responsible for the bio-terrorism attack shown on the news. The necklace is likely a symbol representing the terrorist group or some form of allegiance, which leads Joe to believe that Frida could be a part of the terrorist group or have knowledge about the attack. This prompts him to take action, tying her to a chair and interrogating her by asking questions about U.S. history. This likely stems from his prejudice and the mistaken belief that she might not be loyal to the United States based on her Iranian heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 18:53 EST, 4 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 18:57 EST, 4 October 2013. After five years of trying for a baby, Julie Cummings was beginning to wonder if it would ever happen. She had taken fertility drugs for two years, to no avail. Eventually, she and her husband David decided to resort to IVF. But weeks before the treatment was due to begin, Mrs Cummings became pregnant – after giving up bread. Julie Cummings was told IVF was her only chance of conceiving a child following five years of trying with no success. The result was the couple’s daughter Maisie, now two, who was born two weeks late in January 2011 after a healthy pregnancy. Mrs Cummings, a 37-year-old engineer, stopped eating foods containing high levels of yeast on the advice of a nutritionist, who she went to see because she wanted to adopt a healthier lifestyle before starting IVF. She explained: ‘I cut out potatoes, bread, garlic bread, toast from my diet, and mainly ate just vegetables and fruit. I also took some health supplements. ‘Two months later – that was the only change I had made for five and a half years – and I was pregnant. ‘Now we are just very happy, especially after everything we went through, that Maisie’s come into our life.’ She and David, 50, met in Germany in 2004, when they were both in the military, and started trying for a baby a year later. After nine months with no luck, Mrs Cummings went to see an army medic and was eventually diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, which stops eggs being released. Mrs Cummings, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said: ‘They said I’d need extra help to get pregnant and that it wouldn’t go away on its own. ‘They recommended I go to a fertility clinic in Hertfordshire, where I started on a course of treatment.’ Julie was pregnant with her daughter Maisie within two months and she was born in 2011 after a healthy pregnancy. Mrs Cummings took clomid, a fertility drug used to help re-balance the body’s hormones to increase the chance of ovulation, for more than two years – without success. Doctors told her the next step would be IVF. But when she visited Caroline Sproule, a nutrition and fertility consultant at Bromsgrove Allergy and Nutrition Centre, she was told she was suffering from an infection caused by an overgrowth of a fungus called Candida albicans. This is encouraged by eating foods that contain yeast, such as bread. One of its side effects is menstrual problems, including the stopping of periods altogether, which in turn prevents pregnancy. In March 2010, Mrs Cummings had her first period in six months and by April the same year she was pregnant. She added: ‘I didn’t really go to the centre to get pregnant, just to stand me in good stead for IVF but thankfully we didn’t have to go down that route. ‘It just shows what years of abuse – drinking too much and eating the wrong things – can do to your body.’ What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Known for his diplomatic skills and dedication to regional stability, President Zuma aimed to facilitate fruitful dialogue between the Zimbabwean African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and the opposition, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). This demonstration of neighborly concern and international solidarity further highlights the commitment of South Africa to fostering prosperity and peace throughout the continent. Background of Political Turmoil in Zimbabwe Zimbabwe has been characterized by political unrest and socioeconomic inequality for decades, largely due to the controversial and highly polarizing presidency of Robert Mugabe. In the 2008 national elections, Zimbabwe faced a turning point when the MDC, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, won a majority of the parliamentary seats. Despite this victory, Tsvangirai refused to take office due to the specter of violence and intimidation that permeated the political atmosphere. This led to a power-sharing agreement between the ZANU-PF and MDC, brokered by regional leaders, including then South African President Thabo Mbeki. However, the coalition faced numerous challenges, including consistent obstruction by Mugabe's regime. Zuma's Aim for Unity Government Talks Given the historical and persistent strife between Zimbabwe's main political factions, President Zuma embarked on his diplomatic mission intending to jumpstart negotiations for a unity government in Zimbabwe. The proposed unity government would represent the common interests of Zimbabweans, promote democracy, and usher in an era of political stability and sustained growth. By working towards this goal, President Zuma hoped to encourage reconciliation between the ZANU-PF and MDC, steering the nation towards a more inclusive and representative government. The Importance of a Unified Government The establishment of a unity government in Zimbabwe would serve as a vital catalyst for repairing the fractured political landscape and addressing vital socioeconomic issues plaguing the nation. Such a government would work in the interest of all citizens, bridging the political divide and discouraging the manipulation of tensions for personal gain. By promoting cooperation between historically hostile factions, a unity government would foster an environment conducive to both economic growth and social progress. South Africa's Role in Regional Stability As a country with significant influence within the region, South Africa plays a crucial role in maintaining stability and encouraging growth in Southern Africa. As an advocate for democracy and good governance, South Africa has been actively involved in promoting peace and political reform in Zimbabwe. Through President Zuma's diplomatic intervention, South Africa aims to pave the way for genuine dialogue between the two major Zimbabwean political parties, ultimately enabling them to form a functioning unity government. Conclusion President Zuma's visit to Zimbabwe was a significant step towards knitting together a coalition government that could ultimately usher in a long-awaited era of stability, peace, and prosperity in the country. The ongoing dialogue spurred by Zuma's visit is of paramount importance to Southern Africa's future and represents a crucial opportunity to address pressing challenges in Zimbabwe. By fostering unity and collaboration in the region, South African diplomacy has demonstrated a willingness to prioritize international solidarity and goodwill over narrow national interests, which will remain an essential cornerstone in the global pursuit for justice, equity, and sustainable development."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In this case, a 10 pound canoe is smaller and likely slower-moving than a 150,000-ton cargo ship, so it meets the criteria established in the Explanation."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},E={key:1};function R(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
