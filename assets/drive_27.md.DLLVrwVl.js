Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the drummer on the Self-Destruct tour? , can you please find it? In support of Nine Inch Nails' third full-length studio album, The Fragile, the live-band reformed for the Fragility tour. The lineup remained largely the same from the Self-Destruct tour, featuring Finck, Clouser, and Lohner. To replace long-time member Vrenna, Reznor held open auditions to find a new drummer, eventually picking then-unknown Jerome Dillon. Dillon would remain a member of the live band until 2005. Nine Inch Nails' record label at the time, Interscope Records, reportedly refused to fund the promotional tour following The Fragile's lukewarm sales. Reznor instead committed himself to fund the entire tour out of his own pocket, concluding that \\"The reality is, I’m broke at the end of the tour,\\" but also adding \\"I will never present a show that isn’t fantastic.\\"The Fragility tour began in late 1999, running until mid-2000, and was broken into two major legs, Fragility 1.0 and Fragility 2.0 respectively. Destinations included Europe, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and North America. Before the first Fragility performance date in Spain, Nine Inch Nails opened their final rehearsal in London to 100 fans. Kick-starting the tour was a performance of the title track from The Fragile at the MTV Video Music Awards. Atari Teenage Riot opened for Nine Inch Nails during Fragility 1.0, and A Perfect Circle for Fragility 2.0. At the time, A Perfect Circle featured Josh Freese on drums, who would later replace Dillon and play drums for Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007. The tour featured increasingly large production values, including a triptych video display created by contemporary video artist Bill Viola. Rolling Stone magazine named Fragility the best tour of 2000.In 2002, the tour documentary And All That Could Have Been was released featuring a collection of performances from the Fragility 2.0 tour. While making the DVD, Reznor commented on the tour in retrospect by saying \\"I thought the show was really, really good when we were doing it\\", but later admitted that he \\"can't watch [the DVD] at all....

Help as much as you can. Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

However, following a series of recent developments and the continuous pursuit of justice, a new appeal has been made for information about the case. The Victim and the Crime Scene On a fateful day in 1972, a woman was found murdered in her own home, with signs of a severe struggle evident throughout the residence. The room in which she was discovered had been ransacked and most of her belongings were scattered. Most shockingly, the word \\"ripper\\" had been sprayed onto the living room wall in what appeared to be the victim's own blood. The chosen weapon was never recovered, and authorities were unable to identify any leads through existing forensic technologies of the time. The Investigation At the time of the crime, police went to great lengths to try and solve the mysterious murder. The case garnered widespread attention and fear, owing to the chilling message left at the crime scene, and the media played a significant role in amplifying public awareness. Due to the cryptic reference to the infamous \\"Jack the Ripper\\" murders, investigators initially focused their efforts on possible links to the historical killer. However, as time went on and the case remained unsolved, the trail grew cold, leaving the victim's family and friends without closure. New Appeals and Developments In recent years, advancements in forensic technology have opened new avenues of investigation for cold cases. DNA samples that were previously unusable can now be analyzed, allowing for the identification of potential suspects and exonerating those who were falsely accused in the past. As part of a renewed interest in the 1972 \\"Ripper\\" murder case, local law enforcement agencies have been reexamining old evidence with modern forensic methods. Simultaneous to this, a new public appeal for information has been made, encouraging individuals who may have had knowledge of the crime or familiarity with the victim to come forward and assist in the resolution of this once-stagnant investigation. The Impact on the Community The original impact of the \\"Ripper\\" murder cannot be underestimated. Town safety measures were increased, families took extra precautions, and a pervasive shadow loomed over the entire community. The reemergence of the case, along with the new appeal for information, has brought back memories for many of the unsolved crime, its chilling implications, and the continued pursuit of justice. Conclusion The 1972 \\"Ripper\\" murder case remains a haunting enigma in criminal history. As the renewed appeal for information gains momentum, there may yet be hope for answers that bring the victim's family closer to closure and a sense of justice. For residents of the town, the resurrection of the case serves as a sobering reminder that even after decades, the search for truth and resolution continues. As a society, we must remain vigilant in our collective pursuit of justice, ensuring that even the coldest of cases do not dissipate into oblivion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But a 25-year-old Iranian says his Facebook activity has led to his father's detention in a notorious prison in Tehran. And now he's struggling to find a way to free him. \\"I want my family to forgive me,\\" Yashar Khameneh said. \\"But I believe what I believe in.\\" A year ago, while studying at a college in Holland, Khameneh joined a Facebook page that made fun of a top Shiite Muslim imam, Ali al-Naqi al-Hadi. Naqi is one of 12 imams considered successors to the Prophet Mohammed. Called \\"Infallibles,\\" the imams are protected by law in Iran from ridicule or even frivolous comments. One can be arrested for insulting them. Allowing","completion":"for the strict rules against insulting religious figures in Iran, Khameneh's actions on Facebook eventually caught the attention of the Iranian authorities. This online activity led to a warrant for his arrest, causing him fear for his own safety. Despite being far from his homeland, Khameneh realized that the danger also extended to his family members still in Iran. As a result of Khameneh's actions on social media, his father was arrested by the Iranian authorities. He is being held in Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where he is reportedly facing harsh treatment, including torture and severe interrogation. Iranian authorities are likely using his father's detention as leverage to force Khameneh to return to his home country and face justice for his online activities. Yashar Khameneh, along with his friends, collegemates, and concerned individuals from around the world, have started a global campaign to bring attention to his father's plight and his own legal troubles. Petitions, social media campaigns, and letters to political leaders are all part of an effort to raise awareness about their predicament and the broader issue of freedom of speech in Iran. The movement catches the attention of international human rights organizations, which denounce the Iranian government's actions as gross violations of human rights. These organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, work diligently to bring pressure on the Iranian authorities for the release of Khameneh's father and advocate for a change in Iran's blasphemy laws that inhibit freedom of expression. Meanwhile, Khameneh who continues to be a target for Iranian authorities, seeks asylum in the Netherlands. He fears that the Iranian government may try to force his extradition, should he return to Iran voluntarily or otherwise. The Dutch government, understanding the gravity of his situation, grants him political asylum in their country. This allows Khameneh to continue his studies without fear of immediate persecution, while he continues advocating for his father's release. As the international pressure grows, the Iranian government is forced to reconsider its stance on the case of Khameneh's father. Although they refuse to publicly acknowledge any wrongdoing, behind the scenes, negotiations take place to secure his release. After months of diplomatic efforts and growing public pressure, the Iranian authorities finally decide to release Khameneh's father from prison on the condition of a well-hidden compromise. While Yashar Khameneh's father is eventually released and reunited with his family in Iran, this ordeal serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that individuals in Iran face when exercising their freedom of expression. The story of the Khameneh family, however, becomes a symbol of hope and resilience for those advocating for the protection and expansion of human rights across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Andrej Kramaric has been told he must hit the ground running for Leicester in their bid to beat the drop as the Premier League’s bottom side ready themselves for an unrelenting run of fixtures. Leicester goalkeeper Ben Hamer knows his team need goals instantly with games against Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City within the space of a month — and spelt that out to his new team-mate. Kramaric played 30 minutes in the defeat against Stoke which undermined Leicester’s recent revival, following the Croatian striker’s £9.3million move from Rijeka after a successful work-permit appeal. Andrej Kramaric signed for Leicester this week, and made his first appearance against Stoke on Saturday. Kramaric (centre) shakes hands with manager Nigel Pearson as he readies himself to come on for the Foxes. Fans are excited by the prospect of the new £9.3 million man - one supporter holds a shirt outside the ground. The 23-year-old has scored 28 goals in 31 games this season but had not played for a month before Saturday. ‘It is hard. He’s just come over and he gets thrown into the action,’ said Hamer. ‘Really, he’s got to make an instant impact. Hopefully he can. He hasn’t got time to settle down because we haven’t got that opportunity. Time is of the essence. ‘He’s been sharp in training. I’ve been impressed with him.’ Hamer, 27, has stepped up to replace Kasper Schmeichel, who is out for a few more weeks after breaking a metatarsal. Leicester keeper Ben Hamer (right) has been impressed with Kramaric in training in his first week at the club. Bojan, labelled by Mark Hughes as one of his best ever signings, won the game with a single goal for Stoke. Pearson said there is no guarantee Kasper Schmeichel will come straight back into the Leicester team. Leicester have scored just three goals in their last seven home league games. Manager Nigel Pearson said there was no guarantee the Danish goalkeeper would come straight back into his team once fit, nor that Mark Schwarzer, signed from Chelsea aged 42, would get a game either. ‘I will make the decision on who plays based on who I think is best at any given time,’ said Pearson. ‘Nobody has a divine right to play and I have been pretty pleased with Ben since he has been in the side.’ Bojan scored a superb goal to win the game, his fourth in 10 appearances to cement his status as one of the best value signings last summer. His modest cost of £500,000 is put into context by the price needed to bring Kramaric to England, or the £25m to take Wilfried Bony to Manchester City. Highlights:","completion":"1. Andrej Kramaric is a soccer player who recently joined the Leicester team. 2. He needs to help his team beat other strong teams in upcoming games. 3.

Summarize this article: WASHINGTON — Devoted customers of Apple products these days worry about whether the new iPhone 6 will bend in their jean pockets. The National Security Agency and the nation’s law enforcement agencies have a different concern: that the smartphone is the first of a post-Snowden generation of equipment that will disrupt their investigative abilities. The phone encrypts emails, photos and contacts based on a complex mathematical algorithm that uses a code created by, and unique to, the phone’s user — and that Apple says it will not possess. The result, the company is essentially saying, is that if Apple is sent a court order demanding that the contents of an iPhone 6 be provided to intelligence agencies or law enforcement, it will turn over gibberish, along with a note saying that to decode the phone’s emails, contacts and photos, investigators will have to break the code or get the code from the phone’s owner. Breaking the code, according to an Apple technical guide, could take “more than 5 1/2 years to try all combinations of a six-character alphanumeric passcode with lowercase letters and numbers.” (Computer security experts question that figure, because Apple does not fully realize how quickly the N.S.A. supercomputers can crack codes.) ||||| Photo by Lucy Nicholson/Reuters Last week Apple released its new iOS 8 operating system for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch devices. Most of the coverage of iOS 8 focuses on visible features that users can interact with. But there’s one major change in iOS 8 that most users probably won’t notice unless they find themselves in a great deal of trouble. Specifically, Apple has radically improved the way that data on those devices is encrypted. Once users set a passcode, Apple will no longer be able to unlock your device—even if ordered to do so by a court. While privacy advocates have praised Apple’s move, it has drawn fire from some notable legal scholars. Writing in the Washington Post on Sept. 19, Orin Kerr referred to Apple’s new policy as a “dangerous game,” one that “doesn’t stop hackers, trespassers, or rogue agents” but “only stops lawful investigations with lawful warrants.” While Kerr has moderated his views since his initial post, his overarching concern remains the same: By placing customer interests before that of law enforcement, Apple is working against the public interest. If you interpret Apple’s motivations as Kerr does, then Apple’s recent move is pretty surprising. Not only has the company picked a pointless fight with the United States government, it’s potentially putting the public at risk. The only problem is that Kerr is wrong about this. Apple is not designing systems to prevent law enforcement from executing legitimate warrants. It’s building systems that prevent everyone who might want your data—including hackers, malicious insiders, and even hostile foreign governments—from accessing your phone. This is absolutely in the public interest. Moreover, in the process of doing so, Apple is setting a precedent that users, and not companies, should hold the keys to their own devices. Advertisement To see why this is the case, you need to know a bit about what Apple is doing with its new technology. The first time you power up a new iPhone or iPad, you’ll be asked to set a passcode for unlocking your phone. This can be a full password or just a 4-digit PIN (though the former is certainly stronger). On devices with a Touch ID sensor, you’ll also be allowed to use your fingerprint as a more convenient alternative. Get Future Tense in your inbox. A passcode may look like flimsy security, but it’s not. The minute you set one, Apple’s operating system immediately begins encrypting your phone’s sensitive data—including mail, texts, photos, and call records—using a form of encryption that the U.S. government uses to protect classified military secrets. The key for this encryption is mathematically derived by combining your passcode with a unique set of secret numbers that are baked into your phone. If all goes well, you’ll never notice this is happening. But the impact on data raiders is enormous. Even if someone cracks your phone open and attempts to read data directly off of the memory chips, all she’ll see is useless, scrambled junk. Guessing your passcode won’t help her—unless she can also recover the secret numbers that are stored within your phone’s processor. And Apple’s latest generation of phones makes that very difficult. Of course, your would-be data thief could try to get in by exhaustively trying all possible combinations, but according to an iOS security document, Apple also includes protections to slow this attack down. (In the same document, Apple estimates that a 6-digit alphanumeric password could take upward of five years to guess.) That’s the problem with keys. If you have them, sooner or later someone is going to ask you to use them. The encryption on Apple devices is not entirely new with iOS 8. What is new is the amount of data your phone will now encrypt. Apple has extended encryption protections to nearly all the data you produce on a daily basis and will also require you to enter the passcode (or fingerprint) each time you reboot your phone. In addition, if you purchase a recent iPhone (5S, 6, or 6 Plus), Apple will store your keys within a dedicated hardware encryption “co-processor” called the Secure Enclave. Advertisement Taking Apple’s recent privacy announcements at face value, even Apple itself can’t break into the Secure Enclave in your phone. While it may seem “natural” that the designer of a system—in this case Apple—can break its own encryption, the truth is that such a capability is hardly an inevitable design outcome. For Apple to maintain such a capability with its newer security processors, it can’t just be more knowledgeable than its customers. It would have to literally design in a form of “skeleton key.” In computer security circles this mechanism is generally known as a “backdoor.” Designing backdoors is easy. The challenge is in designing backdoors that only the right people can get through. In order to maintain its access to your phone, Apple would need a backdoor that allowed them to execute legitimate law enforcement requests, while locking hackers and well-resourced foreign intelligence services out. The problem is so challenging that even the National Security Agency has famously gotten it wrong. To dive into the technical weeds, any backdoor Apple might design would likely require the company to store some sort of master access key—or even a whole database of such keys, one for every phone it sells. In the worst case, these keys might need to be carefully transported from the factory in China, to a locked and guarded room at Apple HQ in Cupertino, California. They would be kept isolated from the Internet to protect them from hackers, and Apple would have to constantly monitor its own employees to prevent abuse. None of this is cheap, and the stakes are high: A data breach involving Apple’s master keys could catastrophically harm the company’s reputation, particularly in the security-conscious enterprise market. Much of the Apple criticism thus far stems from the perception that Apple is primarily targeting the U.S. government with its new encryption features. But this is shortsighted. Apple currently has retail stores in 14 countries and sells its phones in many more. The United States is not the only government with law enforcement, or with an interest in its citizens’ data. Advertisement Fortunately we don’t have to speculate about what those interests might be. Back in 2012, rumors swirled that the Indian government had threatened to ban BlackBerry’s messaging services and had even forced BlackBerry to hand over the encryption keys to that service. BlackBerry denied handing over the keys, but eventually admitted it had built a “lawful intercept” mechanism for the Indian government. If Apple holds its customers’ keys (or maintains a backdoor into your phone), then the same calculus will soon apply to Apple. That’s the problem with keys. Once you have them, sooner or later someone will expect you to use them. Today those requests originate from police in the United States. Tomorrow they may come from the governments of China or Russia. And while those countries certainly have legitimate crime to prosecute, they’re also well known for using technology to persecute dissidents. Apple may not see either public interest or shareholder value in becoming the world’s superintendent—meekly unlocking the door for whichever nation’s police ask them to. Apple’s new encryption may not solve this problem entirely—foreign governments could always ban the sale of Apple products or force Apple to redesign. But by approaching the world with a precedent that customers, not Apple, are responsible for the security of their phones, Apple can at least make a credible attempt to stay above the fray. |||||","completion":"Apple's new iPhone 6 encrypts emails, photos, and contacts using a complex mathematical algorithm with a unique code created by its user, making it virtually impossible for law enforcement or intelligence agencies to access the device's contents.

Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

Q: Text: so this didn't happen today, but it was over thanksgiving break in 2012. i lived in south lake tahoe, california, and my parents live in wisconsin. to start the story, i used to be prescribed a large amount of benzodiazepines (klonipin and xanax), as well as live in a city where marijuana is more than acceptable, and on the border of nevada so there are a dozen or so casinos just a few minutes away. if anyone has drank while taking xanax or any other type of benzo, you know that it is a recipe for blacking out, and often disaster. in my infinite wisdom when i was 22 years old and in the middle of a xanax blackout, i decided to bring a quarter ounce of weed in my carry-on bag that i was packing for my trip home the next day. fast forward to a day later, my girlfriend is dropping me off at the airport in reno, nevada (the closest large airport) and i have taken so many pills that i can barely say goodbye, let alone walk myself into the airport and go through security. i didnt check a bag so all i had was my carry-on, and somehow i made it through security completely fine. i have about 40 minutes before my flight leaves at this point, and i decide to get a drink at the airport bar. i start talking to someone and lose track of time after a couple beers and i hear my name being announced over the loudspeaker. i had almost missed my flight, and i hurried to get on the plane. up until this point everything was fine and i was on my way home. i had a connecting flight in minneapolis that take me on the final leg home. after the flight takes off, i take a couple more of my 2 mg xanax and proceed to order some beers. i dont remember exactly how many beers i had on the plane, but it couldn't have been more than 4 or 5 . this combined with 20 plus milligrams of xanax caused me to go into a deep sleep. somewhere during the flight i passed out, however when it came time to get off the plane, no one could wake me up. i was breathing, but basically in a drug and alcohol induced coma. the police were called and they had to basically carry me out of the airport. the last thing i vaguely remember is walking out of the terminal with a police officer on both sides. the next morning at around 5 am i woke up, with both arms restrained in a hospital type bed. i immediately screamed, and a nurse came and untied me. i asked what happened, they informed me of the events, said they had talked to my dad and he had rescheduled my flight for later that morning, handed me all of my stuff along with a police report and my new plane ticket and told me to be on my way. i had a short walk to the airport from the hospital, and i began reading the police report. i had completely forgotten about the weed that i had in my backpack, and the police had found it. in the report it said that they found a container with \\"medical marijuana\\" in it, along with my empty bottle of prescription pills. they took the bud, but somehow i managed to escape that situation without any tickets or criminal charges. my family was extremely worried and disappointed when i didn't show up as scheduled, but in the end everything worked out. i have been so lucky multiple times in my life, and i thank god that i know better than to do this type of this now. i don't know if i ever actually got arrested either, this whole memory is kinda a blur for obvious reasons. my dad still has the copy of the police report that i was handed after this all happened. maybe i will ask him for it soon and post it if anyone is interested. i also have 2 or 3 other stories that involve me getting extremely lucky, i might post them later separately.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A star burns in space - Eventually it burns all its hydrogen - Becomes a red giant - Once the red giant burns itself out - The core of the star collapses - The gasses will start to disperse - Only the core is left - A white dwarf has been formed. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose There is more hydrogen happens, how will it affect a LARGER white dwarf star. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If more hydrogen were to be introduced into the vicinity of a larger white dwarf star, it could potentially have an effect on the process. Below, I've outlined some possible outcomes: 1. Accretion of hydrogen onto the white dwarf: If the additional hydrogen is gravitationally attracted to the white dwarf and begins accumulating on its surface, it could create an accretion layer. This process could lead to increased mass and pressure at the core of the white dwarf. 2. Ignition of the accreted hydrogen layer: If the accreted hydrogen layer becomes dense and hot enough, it may ignite due to nuclear fusion, creating a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the white dwarf. This event, known as a nova, causes a temporary increase in the star's brightness and may lead to expulsion of some outer layers. 3. Potential type Ia supernova: In more extreme cases, if the white dwarf's mass increases beyond the Chandrasekhar limit (approximately 1.4 solar masses) due to the continuous accretion of hydrogen, the star cannot support itself against gravitational collapse. This may result in a type Ia supernova explosion, in which the white dwarf is completely disrupted, and its material is expelled into space. 4. Possible rejuvenation of the white dwarf: In some cases, a constant influx of additional hydrogen could potentially lead to \\"rejuvenation\\" of the white dwarf, stabilizing the star for a longer period and preventing it from cooling down as quickly. In conclusion, the introduction of more hydrogen could have a variety of direct and indirect effects on a larger white dwarf star, depending on the amount of hydrogen, proximity to the white dwarf, and various other factors. These effects could range from minimal impact to drastic changes in the star's evolution, potentially causing novae or supernovae in extreme cases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But beyond the handshakes, casual strolls and shared asides, many analysts and experts are already wondering what exactly the enduring substance of the summit will be and whether it could boost Trump's political rating at home. For Trump, the great political disrupter, it was the most significant foreign policy move of his presidency. It comes at a time when he looks to turn around his often weak polls and bolster his political standing at home in advance of midterm congressional elections in November, where Democrats are poised to make gains. From the images of their historic first handshake to signing an agreement on denuclearization, Trump and Kim took the first steps toward writing a new chapter in relations between their two countries. \\"People are going to be very impressed, people are going to be very happy, and we are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,\\" Trump said sitting alongside Kim after both men signed the joint agreement. It was Trump's biggest moment on the world stage, and an opportunity he was eager to seize. \\"We got along really well.We had a great chemistry.You understand how I feel about chemistry.It is very important,\\" Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren immediately after the summit. \\"I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry. We had it right from the beginning. We talked about that and I think great things are going to happen for North Korea.\\" It was the first ever meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The two men signed an agreement that committed both countries to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but the details remain vague. The United States offered unspecified security guarantees and a halt to military exercises with South Korea. Trump also said he raised the issue of human rights with Kim, but added that most of the meeting focused on the nuclear issue. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: President Trump probably believes that: Options: A. Are experiencing their biggest moment on the world stage B. Good days are ahead for North Korea C. not enough information D. North Korea is tired of military exercises Answer:","completion":"B.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Later, a true coelom evolved. This is a fluid-filled body cavity that is completely enclosed by mesoderm. The coelom lies between the digestive cavity and body wall. You can see it in the invertebrate in Figure below . Modern invertebrates with a coelom include mollusks (Phylum Mollusca) and annelids (Phylum Annelida). Choices: - pseudocoelom - hymenium - choroid - coelom A: Answer:","completion":"The correct option is \\"coelom\\". A coelom is a fluid-filled body cavity that is entirely enclosed by mesoderm. It is situated between the digestive cavity and the body wall, and can be seen in invertebrates such as mollusks (Phylum Mollusca) and annelids (Phylum Annelida). The coelom represents an important evolutionary development, as it provides space for the internal organs, allowing them to function more efficiently and independently of each other. It also acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, providing support and structure to the organism. Other choices provided do not fit the given description: - pseudocoelom: This is also a fluid-filled body cavity but is not entirely surrounded by mesoderm. Instead, it is partially lined with mesoderm and partially lined with endoderm. The pseudocoelom acts as a hydrostatic skeleton and provides space for internal organs, but its functions are considered less advanced than the coelom. - hymenium: This term is related to fungi (specifically, the phylum Ascomycota). It refers to the layer of fungal cells where spores are produced and released. Hymenium is not related to a fluid-filled body cavity in animals. - choroid: The choroid is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue found in the eye of vertebrates, situated between the retina and the sclera. It is involved in oxygen and nutrient supply to the outer layers of the retina. The choroid does not represent a fluid-filled body cavity in invertebrates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Article: Audrey Hepburn won an Academy Award as Best Actress for her first major American movie, Roman Holiday, which was showed in 1953. But she is remembered as much for her help as for her acting. Born in Belgium in 1929, Audrey's father was British and her mother was Dutch. Audrey was sent to live at a British school for part of her childhood. During World war II, she lived and studied in the Netherlands. Her mother thought it would be safe from German attacks. Audrey studied dance as a teenager and during college. But when she returned to London after the war she realized she wasn't going to be a ballet dancer. So she began taking acting parts in stage shows. Later she began to get small parts in movies. But it was Audrey Hepburn's move to America that made her truly famous. In 1951 she played the character \\"Gigi\\" in the Broadway play Gigi and won popular praise. Two years later, Roman Holiday made her a star at the age of 24. Audrey made more than 25 movies. Among her most popular roles was \\"Hoolly Golinghtly\\" in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961. Three years later she played \\"Eliza Doolittle\\" in My Fair Lady. She was married twice. In 1989, the UN Children's Fund named Audrey a goodwill ambassador. She travelled all over the world in support of UNICEF projects. The UN agency said she was a tireless worker. She often gave 15 interviews a day to raise money and get support for UNICEF projects. Audrey Hepburn often said her love to UNICEF was the result of her experiences as a child during World War II. She said she knew what it was like to be hungry and to be saved by international help. She was a goodwill ambassador until her death in 1993 from cancer. Question: How old was Audrey when she acted in Breakfast at Tiffany's? Options: A: 32. B: 25. C: 24. D: 15.

Sentence 2: SCR catalyst manufacturing is almost solely for power generating applications in urban areas. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not entirely entailed by the first sentence, but it does share a significant similarity with it. Let's analyze both sentences to understand the differences and similarities between them. Sentence 1 states that \\"SCR catalyst manufacturing is almost entirely dedicated to power generating applications.\\" This sentence implies that the primary purpose of SCR catalyst manufacturing is to support power generation, leaving little space for other applications. However, it does not specify any particular location or context where the power generating applications take place. Sentence 2, on the other hand, states that \\"SCR catalyst manufacturing is almost solely for power generating applications in urban areas.\\" This sentence adds a specific context—urban areas—to the claim made about the purpose of SCR catalyst manufacturing. It narrows the scope of the statement in Sentence 1, suggesting that SCR catalyst manufacturing mostly caters to the power generation requirements of urban areas. The second sentence is to some extent entailed by the first one, as it maintains the focus on power generating applications being the primary purpose of SCR catalyst manufacturing. However, the addition of the context \\"in urban areas\\" means there is more information in the second sentence that isn't required or implied by the first sentence. It introduces a slight difference in the claims made by each sentence. In other words, while the two sentences share a similar core idea, the second sentence adds a context-specific detail that is not present in the first sentence, causing the two statements not to be completely entailed by each other."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"Kem Ley, a prominent Cambodian political activist and government critic, has been shot dead in the capital Phnom Penh.\\"","completion":"Title: The Assassination of Kem Ley: A Dark Day in Cambodian Politics Introduction The assassination of Kem Ley, a well-known Cambodian political activist and government critic, on July 10, 2016, sparked waves of shock, disbelief, and anger throughout the country. With a deep commitment to social justice, democracy, and human rights, Kem Ley tirelessly advocated for a fairer and more equitable Cambodia for all. His tragic death in a gas station convenience store in Phnom Penh marked not only the loss of a revered figure but also a chilling reminder of the dangers faced by those who challenge the ruling political establishment. This article delves into the life and work of Kem Ley, the circumstances surrounding his brutal murder, and the legacy he leaves behind. Kem Ley: A Voice for the Voiceless Born on October 19, 1970, in Takeo province, Kem Ley began his career as a medical doctor, serving remote communities in need. It was during these years that he recognized the ubiquitous social and economic challenges facing Cambodians. Driven by a desire to bring about positive change, he shifted his focus to grassroots activism, establishing the Khmer for Khmer social and political advocacy group in 2013. Kem Ley was well-known for his keen intellect and his ability to analyze and articulate complex political issues with clarity. He regularly appeared in local and international media as a political commentator. In a climate of frequent defamation cases and journalist intimidation, Kem Ley was unafraid to criticize the ruling Cambodian People's Party's (CPP) policies and Prime Minister Hun Sen's increasingly authoritarian rule. The Assassination of Kem Ley On the morning of July 10, 2016, 45-year-old Kem Ley was shot in the head and chest by an assailant at the Caltex gas station convenience store in central Phnom Penh. He was declared dead soon after. The gunman, identified as Oueth Ang, was promptly apprehended and claimed to have killed Kem Ley over an unpaid debt of 3,000. However, given the victim's status as a prominent government critic, many Cambodians dismissed this motive as a cover-up for a politically motivated assassination. The murder was widely condemned by local and international organizations. The United Nations human rights office and Human Rights Watch called for an independent investigation into Kem Ley's death, expressing concerns over the government's ability to conduct an impartial inquiry. Despite these calls, Cambodia's judicial system, notorious for its lack of independence, handed the investigation and prosecution. In March 2017, Oueth Ang, who adopted the alias Chuor Samlab, meaning \\"Meet to Kill,\\" was found guilty of premeditated murder and illegal possession of a firearm by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Doubts persist about the thoroughness of the investigation, as many details, including the possible involvement of accomplices and masterminds, remain unexplored. The Legacy of Kem Ley In the wake of his assassination, thousands of mourners joined Kem Ley's funeral procession, which extended over 50 miles from Phnom Penh to his hometown in Takeo province. The overwhelming public outpouring of grief and support reinforced his status as a symbol of hope and defiance against the corrupt ruling elite. Kem Ley's murder had a profound chilling effect on Cambodian civil society, with many fearing the escalation of violence and intimidation against activists and journalists. Sadly, his assassination is not an isolated incident. The Cambodian Center for Human Rights documented 36 killings of human rights defenders between 1994 and 2016, with the vast majority of cases unresolved. However, Kem Ley's death also propelled a renewed determination among some Cambodian activists to continue the fight for democracy and justice in their country. His life and work serve as an ongoing inspiration to those who believe in the importance of free speech and political pluralism in a healthy society. Conclusion The assassination of Kem Ley marked a tragic and shocking moment in Cambodia's contemporary history. His bravery in speaking truth to power and unwavering dedication to the pursuit of social justice and democracy will forever echo in the hearts of those who share his vision. The national and international community must not remain silent about this horrific crime and the broader pattern of violence against dissidents in Cambodia. It is essential that those responsible for murdering such a courageous activist be brought to justice and that Cambodian society fights back against the wave of repression that stands in the way of progress and prosperity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Question: suppose there is less pollution happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"To analyze the connection between pollution and volcanic eruptions, let's break down the process step-by-step and examine if pollution has any effect on the different stages: 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the earth: The gases responsible for causing pressure beneath the earth's surface are mainly water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and others. Some of these gases, such as carbon dioxide, can be released due to human activities, but their contribution to the overall gas pressure in the earth's mantle is negligible compared to natural sources. So, there would be no effect of less pollution on this stage. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: This stage mainly depends on the pressure created by the gases and the magma's viscosity. Again, pollution produced by human activities doesn't have any significant influence on this stage. So, there is no effect of less pollution on this stage. 3. The magma cools: The cooling process of magma depends on the surrounding environment temperature and the heat transfer rate. While pollution could potentially have some impact on atmospheric temperatures, it doesn't significantly affect the underground environment where magma cools to form solid rock. So, there is no effect of less pollution on this stage. 4. With enough time the pressure builds up greatly: Pressure buildup is primarily influenced by the geological processes beneath the earth's surface, such as tectonic plate movements, and not pollution. So, there is no effect of less pollution on this stage. 5. The resulting volcano may explode: Volcanic eruptions are driven by the internal pressure and geological processes that have little to no connection to the external factors, such as pollution. Based on this analysis, less pollution would have no effect on causing less or smaller volcanic eruptions, as the perturbation does not significantly influence any stage of the process mentioned above."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the composer without whose presence, according to Anthony Hicks, so unusual a project would not have been attempted? Dean and Knapp record that in early 1707 Keiser surrendered the lease of the Gänsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became responsible for the staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts is that the two parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.The theatre's management was clearly concerned that the public might find the double opera too heavy in undiluted form. Accordingly, a comic intermezzo in Low German dialect (platte-deutsch) was devised by Sauerbrey to precede the performance of Daphne. The critic and essayist Romain Rolland, in his life of Handel, termed this a \\"mutilation\\", carried out \\"for fear that the music may tire the hearers\\".

Questions: When visiting a museum, what might a child experience? Options: - crowding - wonder - being bored - fear - sore feet Answer:","completion":"When visiting a museum, a child might experience a range of emotions and sensations depending on their interests, the type of museum, and the exhibits on display. It is not unusual for a child to experience a combination of the options provided, but a detailed explanation of each option will be given to showcase how they may relate to a common museum visit for a child. 1. Crowding: Museums can often be busy places, especially during peak visiting hours or on weekends and holidays. A child may feel crowded if the museum has a high number of visitors, making it difficult to move around or get a good view of exhibits. This could potentially cause discomfort or frustration for the child. 2. Wonder: Museums are designed to inspire curiosity and wonder in visitors, especially children. It is common for children to be amazed by the artifacts, art, and information presented in a museum. Exhibits often showcase the marvels of human history or the natural world, and a child may find themselves in awe of the incredible discoveries they make. 3. Being Bored: While museums can be fascinating places, some children may not find them as engaging as others. This could be due to a lack of interest in the subject matter on display or the presentation style, which may not cater to a child's preferences. In such cases, a child may feel bored or disinterested during their museum visit. 4. Fear: Depending on the museum's content, a child may experience fear while visiting. For example, a natural history museum may have displays of large animal skeletons or replicas that may seem intimidating for young children. Similarly, exhibits that deal with dark or potentially frightening aspects of history may also cause fear. However, this experience might not be a common one for every child. 5. Sore Feet: A museum visit typically involves a lot of walking and standing, which could lead to sore feet, particularly for children who may not be used to longer periods of walking or standing in one place. This sensation, albeit a minor discomfort, can also negatively impact a child's overall museum experience. In conclusion, when visiting a museum, a child might experience any combination of crowding, wonder, being bored, fear, and sore feet. However, the predominant experiences will depend on the child's personality, interests, and the specific museum's content and environment. A well-planned museum visit, tailored to accommodate the child's interests and preferences, can help maximize the wonder and minimize potentially negative experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask a question about FA Cup.","completion":"What is the significance of the FA Cup in the English football landscape and how has it evolved over time? The Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup, is the oldest and most prestigious domestic knockout tournament in English football. The competition, organized by the Football Association (FA), was first held in the 1871-1872 season, and its significance in the English football landscape is both historical and cultural. The FA Cup's primary significance comes from its long-standing tradition and heritage. It has a unique charm and appeal, rooted in its rich history of over 150 years. The FA Cup has seen many memorable moments, with iconic matches, upsets, and Cinderella stories becoming ingrained in the sport's folklore. This extensive history has contributed to the competition becoming an integral part of English football culture and has captured the imagination of fans worldwide. Another reason for its prominence is its inclusivity. The FA Cup is open to teams from all levels of English football, ranging from amateur and semi-professional clubs to the elite teams in the Premier League. This openness provides smaller clubs with the opportunity to compete against top-flight opposition and achieve dream runs, often leading to magical upsets that fans often remember for years. These so-called \\"giant-killings\\" showcase the unpredictable nature of football and are particularly endearing to neutral fans, exemplifying the spirit of the FA Cup. Additionally, the FA Cup serves as an avenue for clubs to secure a place in European competition. The winner of the cup is granted a spot in the group stages of the following season's UEFA Europa League. Not only does this provide financial benefits to the winning club, but it also offers prestige and respect within the football community. The format of the FA Cup has evolved over time to accommodate the increasing number of participating clubs and changing priorities in the football calendar. Initially, the competition featured a knockout format, with clubs being drawn randomly against each other in a winner-takes-all format. After a few years, replays were introduced to settle drawn matches, and these replays could continue until there was a winner. This system was slightly tweaked in recent editions to help reduce fixture congestion, with modern ties potentially being settled through extra time and penalties after the first replay. In the early years, the competition was dominated by amateur clubs, but with the rise of professionalism in English football, more prominent clubs started to assert their dominance. The tournament has seen numerous dynasties, with clubs such as Manchester United, Arsenal, and Liverpool cementing their status as FA Cup giants through numerous successful campaigns. Despite the growing prominence of domestic leagues and the rise of continental club competitions, the FA Cup has retained its unique charm and importance within the English football landscape. Its long-standing tradition, the opportunity for smaller clubs to make history, and the unpredictability of the knockout format continue to captivate fans season after season."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For example, the dissolution of potassium nitrate in water is an endothermic process. The resulting absorption of energy causes the solution to become colder. Calculations involving heats of solutions follow the same basic approach that we have used with other enthalpy problems. Answer:","completion":"Chemical A causes an endothermic process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The Saints would rebound in the 2nd half to take a 24-21 lead. With 1:34 to go, and the 49ers facing a 4th and 10 from their own 22 yard line, Colin Kaepernick found a wide open Michael Crabtree for a 51-yard gain, that set up the game-tying field goal. On the last play of regulation, the Saints appeared to have scored on a Hail Mary pass from Drew Brees, but the play was overturned by offensive pass interference. In overtime, Ahmad Brooks sacked Brees, causing a fumble recovered by the 49ers Chris Borland on the Saints' 17. On the very next play, Phil Dawson kicked the game-winning field goal, giving the Niners a 27-24 win.

Article: Thousands of cities around the globe turned off their lights for an hour to mark Earth Hour 2014, a symbolic show of support for the environment organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature. Since the movement began in Sydney, Australia, in 2007, it has spread to more than 7,000 cities across more than 160 countries. Singapore continues to hold one of the world's largest lights-off events, drawing around 9,000 people this year to Marina Bay Sands, a commercial center typically awash in electricity. To mark the event actors Andrew Garfield, Jamie Foxx, Emma Stone and a group of other famous stars from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie were in town. Other iconic landmarks that fell dark included the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok's Wat Arun temple, the Empire State Building in New York, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Sydney Opera House, Red Square in Moscow, the Bird's Nest in Beijing and Hong Kong Harbor. As the movement has grown, more organizations and business have committed to switching off their lights in support of efforts to reduce their environmental footprint. In Singapore, at least 600 organizations and companies agreed to either switch off their lights or participate in movements to use fewer plastic bags, take shorter showers, turn up their air-conditioning units or switch to LED lighting. This year the World Wide Fund for Nature, which first launched worldwide Earth Hour, also launched Earth Hour Blue, a crowdfunding platform aimed at raising money for environmental projects around the globe. On Mar. 26 a project to stop the illegal wildlife trade in Asia by providing assistance to wildlife rangers became the first one to reach its target of 20,000 by relying completely on crowdfunding. The hour-long event has little if any impact on electricity consumption, but as an awareness raising event it has registered success.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"A group of people dancing with a hill in the background.\\", can we conclude \\"The group of people are standing on the Great Plains, where there are no hills in sight.\\"?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that the group of people is standing on the Great Plains just because they have a hill in the background. There are several reasons for this and a few important factors to consider. 1. Global locations - Earth is filled with diverse landscapes and geographical features. There are many regions worldwide that have hills, mountains, and other terrain types. Furthermore, hills can also appear in the background of a dancing group of people even if they're not standing directly near the base of the hill. Thus, claiming that the group is standing on the Great Plains solely based on the presence of a hill in the background is not a valid conclusion. 2. Height and proximity of the hill - Not all hills are of the same size. Some hills may appear low, while others might be taller with a more imposing presence. The proximity of the hill to the group of people could also affect the hill's visibility in the background. In this scenario, the description doesn't provide enough information to draw a conclusion about the location of the group. 3. The perspective of the image or visualization - Depending on the vantage point and perspective of the image or the visualization of the group of people dancing with a hill in the background, the hill could appear closer or farther away, or it could be larger or smaller than it's in reality. Without more information, we cannot determine if the group is in the Great Plains or any other specific location. 4. The Great Plains and its geographical features - Although the description of the Great Plains often emphasizes the area's flatness, it doesn't mean there are no hills or other landscape variations in the region. The Great Plains stretch across multiple states in the United States and provinces in Canada, covering a vast area that includes both flat and hilly terrain. It's an overgeneralization to assume that there are no hills in the entirety of the Great Plains. 5. Other possibilities - There are many factors that could create the illusion of a hill in the background, such as shadows, elevations, and other visual elements. With limited information, it's crucial not to dismiss potential alternative possibilities. In conclusion, it's not possible to determine that the group of people is standing on the Great Plains solely based on a hill being present in the background. To make a claim with certainty, more information would be needed, such as additional details on the landscape, geographic coordinates, or a clearer representation of the surrounding area."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola. - Henry James \\"Red\\" Allen (January 7, 1908 April 17, 1967) was a jazz trumpeter and vocalist whose style has been claimed to be the first to fully incorporate the innovations of Louis Armstrong. - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins. - Ralph Edmund Stanley (February 25, 1927 June 23, 2016), also known as Dr. Ralph Stanley, was an American bluegrass artist, known for his distinctive singing and banjo playing. Stanley began playing music in 1946, originally with his brother Carter as part of The Stanley Brothers, and most often as the leader of his band, The Clinch Mountain Boys. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - Louis Armstrong (August 4, 1901 July 6, 1971), nicknamed Satchmo or Pops, was an American trumpeter, composer, singer and occasional actor who was one of the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and different eras in jazz. - Bluegrass music is a form of American roots music, and a related genre of country music. Influenced by the music of Appalachia, bluegrass has mixed roots in Irish, Scottish and English traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of African-Americans through incorporation of jazz elements. - Don Wesley Reno (February 21, 1926 October 16, 1984) was an American bluegrass and country musician best known as a banjo player in partnership with Red Smiley, and later with guitarist Bill Harrell. - Appalachia is a cultural region in the Eastern United States that stretches from the Southern Tier of New York to northern Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. While the Appalachian Mountains stretch from Belle Isle (Newfoundland and Labrador) in Canada to Cheaha Mountain in Alabama, the cultural region of Appalachia typically refers only to the central and southern portions of the range. As of the 2010 United States Census, the region was home to approximately 25 million people. - Jerome John \\"Jerry\\" Garcia (August 1, 1942 August 9, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, best known for his work with the band the Grateful Dead, which came to prominence during the counterculture era in the 1960s. Though he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader or \\"spokesman\\" of the group. - David Grisman (born March 23, 1945, in Hackensack, New Jersey) is an American bluegrass/newgrass mandolinist and composer of acoustic music. In the early 1990s, he started the Acoustic Disc record label to help spread acoustic and instrumental music. - Franklin Delano Roosevelt Wakefield ( born June 26 , 1934 ) is an innovative American mandolin player in the bluegrass music style . Wakefield is known for his collaborations with a number of important and well - known bands , including Red Allen , Don Reno , Jerry Garcia , David Grisman , The Stanley Brothers , and the Greenbriar Boys . - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\". - The Stanley Brothers were an American bluegrass duo made up of brothers Carter Stanley (1925-1966) and Ralph Stanley (1927-2016). Ralph and Carter performed as The Stanley Brothers with their band, The Clinch Mountain Boys, from 1946 to 1966. Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo after Carter's death, from 1967 until his own death in 2016. - American Roots Music is a 2001 multi-part documentary film that explores the historical roots of American Roots music through footage and performances by the creators of the movement: Folk, Country, Blues, Gospel, Bluegrass, and many others. - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians. - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \\"Deadheads\\". \\"Their music,\\" writes Lenny Kaye, \\"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \\"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\\". The band was ranked 57th by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine in its \\"The Greatest Artists of all Time\\" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - An instrumental is a musical composition or recording without lyrics, or singing, although it might include some inarticulate vocals, such as shouted backup vocals in a Big Band setting. The music is primarily or exclusively produced by musical instruments. An instrumental can exist in music notation, after it is written by a composer; in the mind of the composer (especially in cases where the composer herself will perform the piece, as in the case of a blues solo guitarist or a folk music fiddle player); as a piece that is performed live by a single instrumentalist or a musical ensemble, which could range in size from a duo or trio to a large Big Band, concert band or orchestra. - Carter Glen Stanley (August 27, 1925 December 1, 1966) was a bluegrass music lead singer, songwriter, and rhythm guitar player. He formed \\"The Stanley Brothers and The Clinch Mountain Boys\\" band together with his brother Ralph. The Stanley Brothers are generally acknowledged as the first band after Bill Monroe & the Blue Grass Boys to play in the bluegrass genre. According to some historians, their recording of \\"Molly and Tenbrooks\\" (aka \\"The Racehorse Song\\") marked the beginning of bluegrass as a genre. - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass.

Qataris are very religious and there are calls to prayers regularly. Qatari men are dressed in all sorts of traditional clothing plus western dresses. You can easily find imported labour from South Asian countries, poorly paid and discriminated against. I am told that Qataris don't hide their racist attitudes. Women are always wonderful sights. Some are in all sorts of black clothing with face uncovered; some totally enveloped; lots wearing western dresses.

Put it in a place with good circulation so it can dry completely. Drying it out will prevent bacteria from forming inside the loofah. Store your loofah on a hook outside of the shower. Placing it near a vent or fan can also help it dry out quickly. Since many bathrooms stay humid, you might want to dry the loofah in a different room. You can run it through a hot wash cycle with your towels, run it through the dishwasher, microwave it for 30 seconds, or boil it in hot water for several minutes to kill any bacteria that might be growing. No matter what method you use, do it at least once a week to make sure the loofah stays healthy for use. Dermatologists have recently found that loofahs tend to harbor more bacteria than previously thought. That's why it's important to sanitize your loofah often. The same holds true for plastic bath poufs. Even though they aren't made from natural materials, they can still harbor bacteria. After this much time the loofah will be starting to fall apart from use and runs through the washer or boiling water.

I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Now, I have a new situation: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Mix one ounce of leather bleach and one pint of water. Apply this mixture to your boots using a stiff brush. Scrub vigorously to remove any dirt that is on your boots. If you do not have any leather bleach, use a leather cleaner to remove any dirt. Take the time to thoroughly clean your boots. The more dirt you remove, the better the final outcome will be. Use circular motions as you scrub your boots. Once your boots are clean, you must remove the protective coating. Your boots were likely treated with some type of protective finish when they were initially dyed. A deglazer will remove this coating so the dye can be absorbed. To get the best results, you need to remove all of this before you apply the dye. Use a wet cloth or sponge to rub the deglazer all over your boots. The finish and some of the color will come off when you apply the deglazer. You may want to do this outside because the fumes can be very strong. Use a white cloth or rag because you do not want the color from the rag to bleed onto your boots. Use a toothbrush to get the areas between the sole and upper. Wait for the deglazer to evaporate. This usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes. Once your boots have dried, run a damp rag over your boots to make sure you that you have removed all the protective finish. If you still see some shiny areas on your boots, you need to deglaze them again. Removing the protective finish is critical to a successful dye job.

He keeps calm except for his eyes, which twitch uncontrollably, and departs.A day or two later, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney), a local writer, happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore and he sees her body on the beach. He runs to get help or call the police and is seen by two young female swimmers who think that he is the escaping murderer.Police arrive and arrest Tisdall on the testimony of the two witnesses. Also, he is known to own a raincoat matching the murder weapon, a belt coiled in the form of a large question mark that lay near the corpse. Robert claims innocence, but in the crowd that has gathered, none believe him. At first Tisdall is confident that it's all a misunderstanding.After an overnight interrogation at the police station, it's established that he knew Christine and is struggling economically, so his motive seems to be £1,200 left to him in her will. Robert faints, and is revived by Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam) the attractive young daughter of the Chief Constable, Colonel Burgoyne (Percy Marmont), and whom was one of the two women who witnessed him fleeing the beach scene. She seems quite at ease in ordinary male company, talking back vigorously to make her points or get her way.Saddled with a hopelessly inadequate greedy barrister Briggs (J.H.

Christine was a famous actress who had received a surprise visit from her estranged husband, Guy, prior to her death. Guy was angry about Christine leaving him and her relationships with younger men, including the struggling writer Robert Tisdall. Tisdall is arrested for her murder based on the testimony of two witnesses and the fact that he owned a raincoat matching the murder weapon, a belt coiled in the shape of a large question mark.

Write an article that answers the following question: When they did not have a prominent leader, what did they say it was?","completion":"Title: The Absence of a Prominent Leader: Exploring Group Dynamics and Alternative Forms of Leadership Introduction Leadership is undeniably an essential component in various aspects of human life – from politics and business to social structures. A prominent leader often leads successful teams, organizations, and even entire nations as they can unify diverse groups, foster cooperation, and create visionaries for success. However, it's not uncommon for situations to arise where there is no clear-cut figure pushing the team forward. In scenarios where a traditional singular leader is absent, the dynamics can be quite interesting, and the challenges faced can be unique. The absence of a prominent leader often leaves groups to develop alternative forms of leadership to fill the void. Alternative Forms of Leadership 1. Shared Leadership In situations where no prominent leader is present, team members may resort to a shared leadership system. Shared leadership is a process where multiple team members assume the responsibility of leading and managing various aspects of the project, task, or group. This offers the advantage of pooling diverse skills and expertise, as everyone is encouraged to contribute their strengths and take on roles that suit them best. 2. Self-Leadership Another possibility in the absence of a prominent leader is for individuals to develop self-leadership, which is the ability to take personal responsibility for their work, motivation, and well-being. This form of leadership supports an environment where each team member is proactive, accountable, and acts independently to navigate through challenges and contribute effectively to group projects. 3. Emergent Leadership In cases where a traditional leader is absent, an emergent leader may arise from within the team. Emergent leaders are individuals who naturally assume a leadership role when the need arises. They may possess excellent interpersonal and problem-solving skills, or even just exhibit a strong work ethic that inspires others. However, unlike a formal leader, emergent leaders may not hold an official title or rank within the group. 4. Rotational Leadership Another form of leadership in the absence of a clear leader is adopting a rotational leadership system. This involves the rotation of leadership responsibilities among group members so that each person takes turns in assuming the role of the leader. This can foster an increased sense of ownership and accountability among team members, as well as encourage the development of leadership skills in everyone. The Dynamics of Groups Without a Prominent Leader The absence of a prominent leader can lead to a variety of outcomes, depending on the group's dynamics and the type of alternative leadership that emerges. Some possible outcomes include: 1. Increased Communication and Collaboration When there is no single leader to make decisions, group members may feel more inclined to discuss ideas and communicate openly to reach a consensus. This can foster a sense of collaboration, as people are more likely to listen to one another and value each other's opinions. 2. Creativity and Innovation The lack of a central figure dictating the direction, strategy, and decision-making can sometimes create an atmosphere that encourages creativity and exploration. Team members may feel empowered to suggest novel ideas and innovative approaches, without the fear of being shut down by an authority figure. 3. Potential Conflict and Disorganization On the other hand, the absence of a prominent leader can lead to power struggles, confusion, and disorganization within the group. Members may have differing opinions on how tasks should be executed, and without a single leader to steer them in the right direction, they may find it challenging to settle disputes or maintain a cohesive approach. Conclusion Regardless of whether a group has a prominent leader or not, the understanding and application of alternative leadership structures are essential to the successful functioning of any team. While the absence of a prominent leader may present unique challenges, it also offers opportunities for individuals to develop their leadership skills, contribute their strengths, and draw on the collective expertise of the entire group. The emergence of alternative forms of leadership can lead to increased collaboration, creativity, and innovation, ultimately paving the way for a resilient and dynamic team that can adapt to the ever-changing landscape of today's world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Cubans are travelling north, trying to reach the United States by land. They fear that with ties between Cuba and the US improving, the US could stop granting Cubans who reach the US by land the right to stay. Nicaragua accused Costa Rica of \\"hurling thousands of Cubans at Nicaragua's southern border posts\\". The Cubans said they had flown to Ecuador from where they had made their way north through Colombia and Panama to Costa Rica. They reported being stranded in Costa Rica after the trafficking ring which they had paid to get them to the US was broken up by the authorities. On Saturday, Costa Rica issued seven-day transit visas to more than 1,700 Cubans detained after crossing illegally into Costa Rica from Panama. Nicaragua's left-wing government, which has close ties to Cuba, said that move had \\"unleashed a humanitarian crisis with serious consequences for our region\\". The Cubans told Nicaraguan media they had waited for hours to be granted Nicaraguan transit permits before getting impatient and entering the Penas Blancas border post by force. They continued on foot on the Panamerican Highway north, where they were met by Nicaraguan security forces who took them back to Costa Rica. Some migrants said Nicaraguan security forces had fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Costa Rican Foreign Minister Manuel Gonzalez criticised Nicaragua's response. \\"When other countries take the irresponsible decision to close their borders, people will use any means to reach their destination,\\" he said. One Cuban migrant told Nicaraguan newspaper El Nuevo Diario that \\"most of us have been travelling for more than two months\\". \\"We're fleeing unemployment [in Cuba] and among this group, which started gathering in the past days in Costa Rica, are children and pregnant women,\\" the 50-year-old migrant said. Another migrant told Reuters news agency that \\"we don't want to stay in any of these countries, our aim is to reach the United States, that's our objective\\". The number of Cubans leaving the Communist-run island has risen since last December when Cuba and the US announced a thaw in their relations. Historically, Cubans reaching US soil have been given preferential treatment over migrants from other countries. Under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, they can be granted asylum much more easily than applicants from other countries. But with relations between the former Cold War foes improving, many Cubans fear this policy, which dates back to the Cold War, could be abolished. According to US Customs and Border Protection figures, more than 25,000 Cubans entered the US through its southern border between October 2014 and September 2015. Summary:","completion":"Cuban migrants attempt to reach the US by land, fearing that the US might stop granting them the right to stay due to improving relations with Cuba, causing a dispute between Nicaragua and Costa Rica over the handling of these migrants."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: A Good Year Movie plot: In the prologue, a young Max Skinner, whose parents have died in an accident, spends his childhood summer holidays learning to appreciate the finer things in life at his Uncle Henry's vineyard estate in Provence in south-eastern France. Some 25 years later, Max is an unethical yet very successful hard-working London-based bond trader with a sense of humour. Following his uncle's death, Max is the sole beneficiary of the French property. He travels to Provence to prepare a quick sale. Shortly after arriving he almost knocks a local cafÃ© owner, Fanny Chenal, off her bicycle as a result of his careless driving. Subsequently, he discovers that his latest City financial stunt has caused real trouble for the owners of the trading company he works for, and the CEO orders him to return to London as soon as possible. To assist in his planned sale of the property, Max hurriedly snaps some photos and in the process falls into an empty swimming pool. He is unable to escape until Fanny Chenal, driving by and spotting his rental car, appears and turns on the water supply in retaliation. This delay causes Max to miss his flight and, having failed to report to the directors in person, he is suspended from work and trading activities for one week. On Henry's estate, Max must deal with a gruff, dedicated winemaker, Francis Duflot, who fears being separated from his precious vines. Duflot pays a vineyard inspector to tell Max that the soil is bad and the vines worthless. In the meantime, they are surprised by the unexpected arrival of young Napa Valley oenophile Christie Roberts, who is backpacking through Europe and claims to be Henry's previously unknown illegitimate daughter. Like Max, Christie finds the house wine unpalatable but is impressed by Max's casual offering of the boutique Le Coin Perdu (\\"the lost corner\\") vintage, noting some intriguing characteristics. Max is concerned that she might lay claim to the estate and brusquely interrogates her during dinner at the Duflot house. Max gets updates on office politics...

Context: Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments. Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event. That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut. Mickelson's first major championship win came in his thirteenth year on the PGA Tour in 2004, when he secured victory in the Masters with an 18-foot (5.5 m) birdie putt on the final hole. Ernie Els was the runner-up at a stroke back; the two played in different pairs in the final round and had traded birdies and eagles on the back nine. In addition to getting the \\"majors monkey\\" off his back, Mickelson was now only the third golfer with a left-handed swing to win a major, the others being New Zealander Sir Bob Charles, who won The Open Championship in 1963, and Canadian Mike Weir, who won The Masters in 2003. (Like Mickelson, Weir is a right-hander who plays left-handed.) A fourth left-handed winner is natural southpaw Bubba Watson, the Masters champion in 2012 and 2014. Just prior to the Ryder Cup in 2004, Mickelson was dropped from his long-standing contract with Titleist/Acushnet Golf, when he took heat for a voicemail message he left for a Callaway Golf executive. In it he praised their driver and golf ball, and thanked them for their help in getting some equipment for his brother. This memo was played to all of their salesmen, and eventually found its way back to Titleist. He was then let out of his multi-year deal with Titleist 16 months early, and signed on with Callaway Golf, his current equipment sponsor. He endured a great deal of ridicule and scrutiny from the press and fellow Ryder Cup members for his equipment change so close to the Ryder Cup matches. He faltered at the 2004 Ryder Cup with a 1-3-0 record, but refused to blame the sudden change in equipment or his practice methods for his performance. In November 2004, Mickelson tallied his career-low for an 18-hole round: a 59 at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf at Poipu Bay Golf Course in Hawaii. The following year, Mickelson captured his second major at the PGA Championship at Baltusrol, in a Monday final-round conclusion that had been forced by inclement weather the previous day. On the 18th hole, Mickelson hit one of his trademark soft pitches from deep greenside rough to within a 18 inches (460 mm) of the cup, and made his birdie to finish at a 4-under-par total of 276, one shot ahead of Steve Elkington and Thomas Bjorn. Mickelson captured his third major title the following spring at the Masters. He won his second green jacket after shooting a 3-under-par final round, winning by two strokes over runner-up Tim Clark. This win propelled him to 2nd place in the Official World Golf Ranking (his career best), behind Woods, and ahead of Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen. After winning two majors in a row heading into the U.S. Open at Winged Foot, Mickelson was bidding to join Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three consecutive majors (not necessarily in the same calendar year). Mickelson was the joint-leader going into the final round, but he was part of a wild finish to the tournament, in which he made major mistakes on the final hole and ended up in a tie for second place at +6 (286), one shot behind Geoff Ogilvy. Mickelson bogeyed the 16th hole of the final round. On the 17th hole, with the lead at +4, he missed the fairway to the left, and his drive finished inside a garbage can, from which he was granted a free drop; he parred the hole. He had a one-shot lead and was in the last group going into the final hole. Needing a par on the 18th hole for a one-shot victory, Mickelson continued with his aggressive style of play and chose to hit a driver off the tee; he hit his shot well left of the fairway (he had only hit two of thirteen fairways previously in the round). The ball bounced off a corporate hospitality tent and settled in an area of trampled-down grass that was enclosed with trees. He decided to go for the green with his second shot, rather than play it safe and pitch out into the fairway. His ball then hit a tree, and did not advance more than 50 yards (46 m). His next shot plugged into the left greenside bunker. He was unable to get up and down from there, resulting in a double bogey, and costing him a chance of winning the championship outright or getting into an 18-hole playoff with Ogilvy. After his disappointing finish, Mickelson said: \\"I'm still in shock. I still can't believe I did that. This one hurts more than any tournament because I had it won. Congratulations to Geoff Ogilvy on some great play. I want to thank all the people that supported me. The only thing I can say is I'm sorry.\\" He was even more candid when he said: \\"I just can't believe I did that. I'm such an idiot.\\" Question: What happened to Phil in 2006? Answer:","completion":"In 2006, Phil Mickelson experienced some ups and downs in his professional golf career. The most significant achievement for Mickelson that year was winning his second Masters Tournament, which gave him his third major championship title. He won this tournament by shooting a 3-under-par final round, finishing with a two-stroke lead over runner-up Tim Clark. His victory at the Masters in 2006 led him to be ranked 2nd in the Official World Golf Ranking, which was his career-best at that time. However, Mickelson also faced disappointment at the 2006 U.S. Open held at Winged Foot. Heading into the final round, he was the joint-leader, with an opportunity to join Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods in winning three consecutive major championships. Mickelson's aggressive playing style ultimately led to his downfall in the final round. He bogeyed the 16th hole and hit a wayward drive on the 18th hole, missing the fairway to the left and causing the ball to bounce off a corporate hospitality tent. Furthermore, instead of opting for a safe play, he decided to go for the green with his second shot, which hit a tree and did not advance much. Mickelson's subsequent shots landed him in a greenside bunker, and he was unable to get up and down from there, resulting in a double bogey. This double bogey on the final hole cost him a chance of winning the championship outright or participating in an 18-hole playoff with eventual winner Geoff Ogilvy. After the tournament, Mickelson expressed his disappointment and shock in his post-tournament interviews, calling himself an \\"idiot\\" for his decision-making on the 18th hole. Despite the setback at the 2006 U.S. Open, Mickelson's victory at the Masters that year still marked a key highlight in his golf career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT: -- Sandpaper to help with current project , sanding the desk .; -- None of the above choices .; -- A book with owls in it perhaps one like Harry Potter .; -- A new desk so that they did n't have to work to sand the old one that they have .;","completion":"A more common gift for the neighbor to have given to the narrator, based on his job at Barnes and Noble, would be a book with owls in it, perhaps one like Harry Potter. This is because Barnes and Noble is a popular bookstore chain, and employees working there would have access to various books and likely receive a discount on their purchases. The neighbor's job at Barnes and Noble suggests that he might be more knowledgeable about books and might be more inclined to give a book as a gift. In addition, since the topic of owls is mentioned, it is plausible that the neighbor might think of a book that features owls, such as the Harry Potter series, which contains a famous owl character named Hedwig. The other choices are less common or less relevant when considering the neighbor's job. While giving sandpaper to help with the current project could be a thoughtful act, it does not directly relate to the neighbor's job at Barnes and Noble. The option of a new desk also seems less likely, as buying a new desk is a more significant purchase and is less connected to the neighbor's job at a bookstore. Lastly, suggesting \\"none of the above choices\\" does not provide a relevant answer based on the provided information about the neighbor's job."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the popular mind, the history of Hong Kong, long the entryway to China for Westerners, begins in 1841 with the British occupation of the territory. However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

Movie title: April Fool's Day Movie plot: On April 1, 2007, Desiree Cartier is hosting a party at her mansion for her actress friend Torrance Caldwell. Present for a pre-festivities toast areâBlaine Cartier, Desiree's brother, who controls their joint inheritance (to Desiree's dislike), U.S. Senate candidate Peter Welling, Peter's \\"Miss Carolina\\" fiancee Barbie Reynolds, and the quintet's less wealthy videographer friend Ryan. With the party in full swing, Desiree's social nemesis and Ryan's not-so-secret crush Milan Hastings, arrives. Also present is chihuahua-toting society reporter Charles. As another in her long string of April Fool's pranks, Desiree suggests Blaine get Milan tipsy on champagne and seduce her in his bedroom upstairs. Desiree and several of the others hover by the cracked-open bedroom door, prepared to videotape the affair with the camera Desiree lifted from Ryan. However, Milan has a seizure and falls off the balcony to her death. The group goes to court, and Blaine loses control of the family's fortune, which shifts to Desiree, but they are considered innocent and Milan's death is considered a fatal prank. One year later, Desiree, Blaine, Peter, Barbie, Torrance, and Ryan receive anonymous invitations to meet on Milan's grave at noon, April 1, 2008, with the cryptic P.S. \\"I have proof.\\" Just after the entire sextet is back together, a messenger comes to the grave with a box containing a letter and a laptop computer. The letter says one of the six murdered Milan, and if that person does not confess, all of them will be dead by midnight. As a show of intent, the computer has footage of Charles drowning in his pool. Everyone goes from the cemetery to the pool to confirm this mishap. Subsequently, an increasingly frantic Desiree sees one \\"suspect\\" after another \\"murdered\\" before her eyes (though the bodies keep disappearing). Barbie is electrocuted in a beauty pageant dressing room, Peter's campaign truck runs him down in a parking garage, Ryan's throat is slit in his humble apartment, and returning home, Desiree and Blaine... The answer is:","completion":"The footage of Charles drowning in his pool serves as evidence and a show of intent by the anonymous threat-maker. The letter sent to Desiree, Blaine, Peter, Barbie, Torrance, and Ryan claims that one of the six people murdered Milan, and if that person does not confess, all of them will be dead by midnight. The footage of Charles drowning is included on the laptop computer as a warning to the group, demonstrating that the threat is serious and not just another April Fool's prank. The party attendees, who all played a role in Milan's fatal prank a year before, receive anonymous invitations to gather at Milan's grave. It's there that a messenger delivers a box containing the letter and laptop computer. Once the group confirms Charles' death by visiting his pool, they are all in fear of their lives, especially Desiree, as she begins to witness her friends being \\"murdered\\" one by one. This creates a sense of urgency for the group to figure out who is responsible and confess in order to avoid the promised deaths by midnight.

It tells us that men's rhythmic gymnastics developed in Japan and originated from stick gymnastics, providing the geographical location and the root discipline. However, an extended and more comprehensive response can provide additional background information, deeper context, and emphasize the essence of the discipline. A more detailed and long answer would be: Men's rhythmic gymnastics, also known as Men's Group Gymnastics or Jika-tabi, originated in Japan in the late 1960s to early 1970s. The sport developed from a Japanese martial arts discipline called \\"stick gymnastics,\\" where participants perform various athletic movements, flows, and acrobatics using a wooden stick or a cane as a prop. Stick gymnastics itself traces its roots back to samurais' weapon training and also has fundamental connections to traditional Japanese theater, such as Kabuki and Noh. The idea behind the transformation of stick gymnastics into men's rhythmic gymnastics was to create a group gymnastics activity that integrates elements of artistic gymnastics, acrobatics, and dance. Men's rhythmic gymnastics focuses on the collaboration, synchronization, and harmony among team members when performing choreographed routines. It has evolved into a highly disciplined and aesthetically refined sport that emphasizes balance, flexibility, and strength. In men's rhythmic gymnastics, the competitors perform as a group, typically consisting of six members. These teams design routines that involve carefully synchronized movements, lifts, transitions, and balances, carried out to music. Performances in men's rhythmic gymnastics are characterized by impressive displays of agility, coordination, muscle control, and teamwork. Due to its prominent connection to Japanese culture and history, the sport is more popular in Japan than in other parts of the world. However, it has gradually gained recognition in countries like Finland and some Asian nations. In conclusion, men's rhythmic gymnastics is a discipline that stemmed from stick gymnastics in Japan, combining elements of artistic gymnastics, acrobatics, and dance. Focusing on group performance, synchronization, and harmony, it has evolved into a unique and fascinating sport appreciated by audiences around the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee, the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake.A series of earthquakes inside Long Valley Caldera, coincidentally starting two weeks after the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington, alerted geologists to the possibility of renewed volcanic activity in the region. Four magnitude 6 earthquakes struck the southern margin of Long Valley Caldera in an area that was close to the Mono–Inyo fissure system. The caldera floor had also uplifted by 10 inches (30 cm) in five years. Upward movement of magma under the caldera was thought to be the cause of the earthquakes and uplift.Persistent earthquake swarms in 1982 prompted the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to issue a \\"potential volcanic hazard\\" notice for Long Valley. That same year, permanent monitoring of the area by the Long Valley Observatory started. The hazard notice was lifted in 1984 after USGS scientists concluded that magma had been injected into fissures below Mammoth Mountain but had congealed underground. From 1990 to 1996, 150 acres (60 ha) of trees were killed on Mammoth Mountain by 20% to 95% concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the soil (less than 1% is normal). Chemical analysis of the CO2 indicated it was derived from magma. contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the area that had upward movement of magma under it?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The name of the area that had upward movement of magma under it is Long Valley Caldera. The caldera experienced a series of earthquakes, and it was the upward movement of magma below the caldera that was thought to be the cause of these earthquakes and uplift."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

English: The simply fact of the matter is that expensive products don't automatically equal quality products! Spanish:","completion":"El simple hecho de la cuestión es que los productos caros no equivalen automáticamente a productos de calidad. En esta oración, el hablante expresa su opinión sobre un tema común en la sociedad de consumo. La oración destaca la idea de que, aunque a menudo se cree que los productos costosos son sinónimo de calidad, esto no siempre es cierto. Esta opinión se puede aplicar a una amplia variedad de productos y situaciones en la vida cotidiana. Para comprender mejor el significado de la oración, analicemos las partes clave del mensaje. Primero, \\"el simple hecho de la cuestión\\" pone un énfasis en la idea de que el hablante está hablando de algo fundamental y evidente. Esta expresión implica que, en realidad, la cuestión no es compleja y que la verdad es sencilla. La palabra \\"productos caros\\" se refiere a bienes o servicios que tienen un precio elevado, generalmente en comparación con otros artículos similares en el mercado. Las personas a menudo asocian los productos caros con una mejor calidad, durabilidad y, en algunos casos, un cierto estatus social. Sin embargo, en esta oración, el hablante cuestiona esta suposición. La palabra \\"productos de calidad\\" se refiere a bienes o servicios que tienen un alto nivel de rendimiento, durabilidad y cumplimiento con los estándares establecidos, independientemente de su precio. A menudo, los productos de calidad están respaldados por una buena garantía, un servicio al cliente receptivo y muchas opiniones positivas de otras personas que los han utilizado. Cuando el hablante dice \\"no equivalen automáticamente\\", está haciendo una declaración directa de que no existe una correlación directa e inmediata entre el precio y la calidad de un producto. El mensaje aquí es que es importante no dejarse engañar por la presunción de que un producto caro es siempre sinónimo de uno de calidad. Esta opinión es respaldada por la experiencia de muchas personas que han comprado productos caros y, más tarde, han descubierto que no cumplen con sus expectativas en términos de calidad y durabilidad. También es fundamental tener en cuenta que, en algunos casos, se paga más por la marca o el diseño, en lugar de por la propia calidad y funcionalidad del producto. En conclusión, la oración en español \\"El simple hecho de la cuestión es que los productos caros no equivalen automáticamente a productos de calidad\\" envía un mensaje claro sobre la relación entre el precio y la calidad de los productos. El hablante advierte a los consumidores que no deben asumir automáticamente que un producto caro es siempre un producto de calidad y, en cambio, deben investigar y evaluar cada producto en función de su rendimiento, durabilidad y cumplimiento con los estándares de calidad establecidos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – A Sarah Palin interview on the Today show Monday quickly got testy when the subject of PTSD and her son came up. After discussing Iowa for a few minutes, Savannah Guthrie changed the subject to Track Palin and his mother's recent comments about his domestic violence arrest. \\"You mentioned PTSD and you said that President Obama may be to blame for some of the PTSD that's out there,\\" said Guthrie. But Palin interjected, \\"I never said that, I never said that,\\" reports Politico. She elaborated: \\"I never blamed President Obama. What I have blamed President Obama in doing, though, is this level of disrespect for the United States military.\\" When Matt Lauer asked if Palin rejected the earlier comments, she shot back, \\"What did I say that's offensive? I don't regret any comment I made because I didn't lay PTSD at the foot of the president.\\" The comments in question came last month when Palin said military vets like Track \\"come back a bit different—they come back hardened,\\" and then added: “It's a shame that our military personnel even have to question, have to wonder if they're respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question, though, it comes from the top, the question, though, that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder, 'Do you know what we go through? Do you know what we’re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us?'\\" Palin objected to the matter being brought up, but this Washington Post blogger thinks it's \\"fair game\\" because Palin is the one who raised it on the campaign trail.","completion":"Sarah Palin and PTSD: A Contentious Topic on the Today Show Former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, made a memorable appearance on the Today show recently, where discussions regarding her son's arrest and PTSD quickly turned heated. The conversation began with the subject of the Iowa caucus but was swiftly diverted when co-host Savannah Guthrie questioned Palin about her recent comments regarding her son, Track Palin, and his struggles with PTSD. Track Palin, a veteran of the United States military, was arrested last month in connection with a domestic violence incident. His mother has since been vocal in attributing his violent actions to PTSD. In a public address, Sarah Palin spoke about how military veterans like her son often return from service with altered personalities and behaviors. \\"They come back a bit different—they come back hardened,\\" she stated. During the Today show interview, Guthrie asserted that Sarah Palin had previously hinted at President Obama being responsible for the PTSD experienced by veterans, such as her son. Palin, however, was quick to clarify her stance: \\"I never said that, I never said that,\\" she countered. Palin continued to state that she did not specifically blame President Obama for the prevalence of PTSD among military personnel. Rather, she attributed it to a \\"level of disrespect for the United States military\\" that she believes has arisen under his administration. Today show co-host Matt Lauer, not willing to let the issue rest, asked Palin if she would like to retract her earlier remarks regarding PTSD and President Obama. Palin remained resolute in her position, stating, \\"What did I say that's offensive? I don't regret any comment I made because I didn't lay PTSD at the foot of the president.\\" Palin's comments suggest that she believes the current administration has nurtured a culture of disregard for the sacrifices made by the nation's military personnel. She expressed her concern that military veterans now find themselves doubting the support and respect afforded to them by their government. Specifically, she questioned the understanding of the president when it comes to the experiences and challenges faced by veterans upon their return to civilian life. \\"('Do you know what we go through? Do you know what we’re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us?')\\" Palin said, addressing the uncertainty she feels arises from the president's actions and policies. The contentious topic of PTSD and its role in the plight of veterans like Track Palin has long been discussed on both the national and global stages. While many are sympathetic to those who struggle with the mental scars of combat, others argue that personal responsibility cannot be entirely overlooked in the wake of violent actions and behavior. While Sarah Palin objected to the matter being brought up during her Today show appearance, commentators have argued that it is \\"fair game\\" because it was Palin who initially voiced her opinions on PTSD on the campaign trail. The issue of PTSD, its connection to the actions of veterans like Track Palin, and the role of the current administration in addressing the mental health needs of military personnel, remain topics under heated debate in American society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: The dumbest thing that actually worked? I joined Tinder. Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn’t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn’t have asked me out on a date. I hope that answers your question. I know it wasn’t very…. eventful.

When blogging first started, the IT people had the technological advantage and they took the chance to put their thoughts on the web.

Question: Who wanted Alex to take his place and become the next sin-eater? Movie plot title: The Order Movie plot: This section's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (July 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film's premise is that there is another way to heaven than adherence to the practices of the Roman Catholic Church. A secular Sin Eater can remove all taint of sin, no matter how foul, from the soul just before death. The purified soul can then ascend into heaven. The Roman Catholic Church, according to the film, considers this heresy. Heath Ledger plays an unhappy and disillusioned priest, Alex Bernier, a member of a fictitious religious order The Carolingians which specializes in fighting demons and other hell spawn. Father Dominic, the head of the Carolingians, has died in Rome under suspicious circumstances and Alex leaves the United States to investigate. In Rome, Alex visits the morgue and sees strange markings on Dominic's corpse. After some investigation, he comes across a book that explains the markings as being the sign of a Sin Eater's work. He heads to the Vatican, where an official tells him that Sin Eaters don't exist and that Dominic may not be buried on sacred ground because he had been excommunicated for his beliefs. Alex, moving ever farther from his vocation, defies his superiors and secretly reads a holy service over the body and buries Dominic in the Carolingian cemetery (the service takes place off screen but is referred to later). Thomas Garrett, another Carolingian (there seem to have only been a total of three including Dominic), arrives in Rome to help investigate Dominic's death. Early in the film we meet Mara Williams, an artist Alex once exorcised, who has escaped from a mental hospital and come to Alex at his church in the USA because she has a feeling that something terrible is going to happen to him. The police come looking for her, but Alex lies and denies that he's seen her and through this exchange we learn that Mara was in the hospital because she had tried... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Order,\\" it is the sin-eater, William Eden, who wanted Alex Bernier to take his place and become the next sin-eater. Throughout the film, Alex unravels the mystery surrounding the death of Father Dominic and the existence of sin-eaters. As Alex grows increasingly disillusioned with the Church and his role as a priest, William sees potential in Alex to carry on the sin-eater legacy. William believes that Alex's disillusionment and knowledge about sin-eaters make him the ideal candidate to take over this secretive and heretical practice after he passes away."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read this: Pluralistic idealism such as that of Gottfried Leibniz takes the view that there are many individual minds that together underlie the existence of the observed world and make possible the existence of the physical universe. Unlike absolute idealism, pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mental reality or \\"Absolute\\". Leibniz' form of idealism, known as Panpsychism, views \\"monads\\" as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception. The monads are \\"substantial forms of being\\",elemental, individual, subject to their own laws, non-interacting, each reflecting the entire universe. Monads are centers of force, which is substance while space, matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads. There is a pre-established harmony established by God, the central monad, between the world in the minds of the monads and the external world of objects. Leibniz's cosmology embraced traditional Christian Theism. The English psychologist and philosopher James Ward inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism. According to Ward the universe is composed of \\"psychic monads\\" of different levels, interacting for mutual self- betterment.

Given the below context: While on a hunting trip on Loyalsock Creek north of the park in 1850, brothers Elijah and Clemuel Ricketts were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor. In 1851 or 1853 they bought 5,000 acres (2,000 ha), including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park, as their own hunting preserve, and built a stone house on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855. The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as \\"Ricketts Folly\\" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek.Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned 66,000 acres (27,000 ha), and eventually this grew to more than 80,000 acres (32,000 ha), including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park.While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition north of the house. The addition used lumber from a sawmill Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875, about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) southeast of the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873; Ricketts' brother Frank, for whom a park waterfall is named, managed it from then until 1898. Many of the hotel's guests were Ricketts' friends and relations, who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock,... Guess a valid title for it!

Why would this woman be willing to help the wayward kid ?","completion":"This woman would be willing to help the wayward kid for a variety of reasons, primarily driven by her personal values, professional duties, and sense of empathy and compassion. As a member of society, it is natural for individuals to look out for one another, especially in instances where a vulnerable child is in need of assistance. The following factors may influence her willingness to help the child: 1. Personal values and morals: Her upbringing, culture, religion, or personal belief system might emphasize the importance of helping others, particularly in times of need. This woman may have a strong sense of responsibility towards the well-being of her community and those around her. She may believe that helping a lost child is not only the right thing to do, but is also an act that reflects her own character and morals. 2. Professional responsibility: As an employee at Wal-Mart, she is likely trained to assist customers in various situations, including when a child gets separated from their parents. Many stores and establishments have protocols in place to handle lost children to ensure their safety while they are on the premises. The woman's willingness to help may stem from her obligation to provide customer service and uphold the principles of her employer. 3. Empathy: The woman might genuinely feel compassionate towards the child, understanding that it must be very frightening for the young boy to be lost, separated from his family, and uncertain about what to do next. Empathy can create a strong emotional connection and drive individuals to help others experiencing distress. 4. Motherly instinct or personal experiences: The woman might be a mother herself or have other childcare experience, giving her a more profound understanding of the child's plight and a stronger inclination to help. Additionally, if she has ever experienced a similar situation either as a child who was once lost or as a parent who lost their child momentarily, she may remember the fear and anxiety and be more motivated to help other parents and children avoid that experience. 5. Sense of duty: She might have a strong sense of duty towards the welfare of others, especially children, who are often seen as more vulnerable and in need of protection. The woman may view it as her responsibility to help a child in need, no matter the specific circumstances. 6. Reciprocity: The woman may believe in the principle of reciprocity, meaning she would hope that if she were ever in a similar situation, someone else would be willing to help her or her loved ones. By assisting the lost child, she might be demonstrating her commitment to treating others the way she would want to be treated. All these factors contribute to the woman's willingness to help the wayward kid. In doing so, she is making a positive impact on the child's life, alleviating the fear and anxiety he may be experiencing, and ultimately, helping to reunite him with his family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Little does Luca know that each brushstroke on his canvas risks tangling him in a web of deception, betrayal, and danger. As Luca's career skyrockets, his life spirals out of control. Will Luca be able to expose the truth behind the cruel art world and untangle himself from the machinations of his boss, or will he become a pawn in a game that will cost him the ultimate price? Plot Summary: Set in modern-day Paris, Luca Moretti is a young and passionate Italian artist who moves to the city of lights to pursue his dreams of becoming a renowned painter. He is introduced to Francois Jacios, a sophisticated and enigmatic art connoisseur, gallery owner, and former artist. Francois is captivated by Luca's raw talent and hires him to work on a prestigious yet mysterious art project. As Luca starts painting for Francois, his style evolves, incorporating elements of surrealism and abstraction. His artwork captivates Paris' high society, turning him into an overnight sensation. Working for Francois opens doors for Luca, but it also exposes him to the darker side of the art world. He learns that his boss is involved in a series of art-related crimes, including forgery, theft, and underground auctions of priceless stolen masterpieces. Luca's growing friendship with a curious journalist named Isabelle compels him to investigate Francois' shady dealings further. When Isabelle winds up dead under mysterious circumstances, Luca realizes that he has become a pawn in a much bigger game. With law enforcement and the criminal underworld closing in, he must quickly unravel the puzzle to save himself from falling victim to the same deadly fate. Through hidden messages and clues woven into his paintings, Luca makes a series of shocking discoveries. He finds out that Francois is seeking revenge for past betrayals in the art world and is using Luca's work to expose some of the biggest players in the Paris art scene. Luca must find the strength to face his boss and the moral dilemma of his success as an artist — which ultimately stems from the dangerous world of Francois. In the thrilling climax, Luca confronts Francois in his gallery, only to find himself trapped in a perilous life-or-death situation. In a battle of wits and deception, Luca devises an ingenious plan to expose Francois and uncover the truth behind the art world's darkest secrets. He sets up a major exhibition featuring his paintings, all of which contain hidden details that expose the extent of the criminal network, which ultimately leads to the arrest of Francois and his accomplices. The film concludes with Luca returning to Italy and reestablishing himself as an artist of integrity as he starts over and reclaims his life, altered yet enriched by his harrowing Parisian journey. Through learning about the dark side of the art world, Luca discovers the importance of truth and integrity in his artwork and his life, leaving the audience to contemplate the value and cost of art, success, and personal ambition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To avoid his grief, he buries himself in his work and ignores his new daughter, Gertie, while his father, Bart (George Carlin), takes a month off from work to care for her, but returns so that his son is forced to live up to his responsibility as a parent. Under the stress of a botched diaper change and a baby who will not stop crying, Ollie trashes his client Will Smith for his soon-to-be released film Independence Day in front of assembled reporters. The outburst costs him his job, so he moves in with his father in New Jersey. He eventually apologizes for ignoring his daughter, and attributes his public outburst to his grief. Blacklisted by all of New York City's public relations firms, Ollie has to work as a civil servant in the borough where he now lives with his father. Seven years later, in 2003, Gertie (Raquel Castro), now in elementary school, often coaxes him to rent films to watch. At the video store, they meet Maya (Liv Tyler), a graduate student and one of the store's clerks, whose uninhibited probing into Ollie's love life almost leads to their having casual sex. She soon becomes a part of their lives.

Here is a news article: Donald Sterling plans to still sue the NBA, according to a statement released by his attorney Monday. \\"The action taken by [NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver and the NBA constitutes a violation of my rights and fly in the face of the freedoms that are afforded to all Americans,\\" Sterling said through attorney Bobby Samini. \\"I have decided that I must fight to protect my rights. While my position may not be popular, I believe that my rights to privacy and the preservation of my rights to due process should not be trampled.\\" While Sterling may be ready to continue to press his case against the NBA, including a 1-billion lawsuit he filed two weeks ago, his wife, Shelly, can also go to court in an attempt to clarify her right to control the team and its sale to Steve Ballmer for 2 billion. Shelly Sterling had previously become the sole trustee after her lawyers sent a letter to Donald Sterling on May 29, informing him that she was in charge because of his inability to conduct business affairs. While it is not required in the terms of the trust, Shelly Sterling could go to court to try to get a judge to validate her position. That would prevent another 11th-hour challenge from her husband. In such a court action, Shelly Sterling would presumably bring forward the brain scans that her husband submitted to as well as reports written by the pair of neurologists. People familiar with the bidding for the Clippers, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Donald Sterling's topsy-turvy behavior in regard to the sale also could be presented as evidence. After signing a letter May 22 saying he gave his wife the right to negotiate a sale of the Clippers, including his 50% interest, Sterling later said he only meant for her to negotiate, not complete a deal. Then, last week, Sterling sent signals that he was at peace with the transaction and would let it go through, even issuing a statement through Samini saying he would not continue his fight. A different attorney for Donald Sterling later said that Sterling believed the NBA would drop its 2.5-million fine and lifetime ban against him, something the league said it never agreed to do. When Sterling learned that the fine and ban remained in place, his camp again gave combative signals. Monday's statement from Samini was the latest sign that Donald Sterling was not ready to give up the team he has owned for 33 years. ||||| In a reversal, Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling will pursue a 1 billion federal lawsuit against the NBA and commissioner Adam Silver, and withdraw his support for the sale of the team negotiated by his wife. \\"I have decided that I must fight to protect my rights,\\" Sterling said Monday in a letter circulated widely among those involved in the sale and obtained by ESPN.com. \\"While my position may not be popular, I believe that my rights to privacy and the preservation of my rights to due process should not be trampled.\\" Sterling's attorney Max Blecher earlier told ESPN.com in an email, \\"The deal is off.\\" Sources told ESPN.com on Tuesday that Shelly Sterling and her lawyers intend to seek an emergency order from a California probate court Wednesday morning for an expedited hearing to resolve the situation with her estranged husband. Last week, both Donald Sterling and Blecher indicated publicly that they would accept the record 2 billion sale to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. In an interview with NBC4 during a charity function, Sterling said he was ready to \\"move on.\\" However, Sterling has since changed course. Whether he will be successful in this new challenge remains to be seen. \\"From the onset, I did not want to sell the Los Angeles Clippers,\\" he said in the letter. \\"I believe that Adam Silver acted in haste by illegally ordering the forced sale of the Clippers, banning me for life from the NBA and imposing the fine. Adam Silver's conduct in doing so without conducting any real investigation was wrong. \\"The action taken by Adam Silver and the NBA constitutes a violation of my rights and fly in the face of the freedoms that are afforded to all Americans.\\" Blecher and another Sterling attorney, Bobby Samini, declined Monday to comment on whether the NBA's refusal to drop Sterling's lifetime ban and 2.5 million fine is the impetus for his change of heart. \\"There was never a discussion involving the NBA in which we would modify Mr. Sterling's penalty in any way whatsoever,\\" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said. \\"Any suggestion otherwise is complete fabrication.\\" The lawsuit alleges the league violated Sterling's constitutional rights by relying on information from an \\"illegal\\" recording that publicized racist remarks he made to a girlfriend. It also said the league committed a breach of contract by fining Sterling and that it violated antitrust laws by trying to force a sale. Meanwhile, Shelly Sterling, Ballmer and the league remain confident the sale will proceed. \\"Nobody doubts this thing will go through in the end. I guess it's just a matter of what mood Donald wakes up in tomorrow,\\" one source close to the situation said. In an interview taped Sunday and released Monday, Silver told CNN that the league will be able to \\"take a deep breath\\" when the sale is complete. \\"He's unsold his club several times over the years,\\" Silver said. \\"There's well-noted incidents in the league when he was right there at a closing and at the last minute decided not to sell. And until he signs that document, we still have a pending litigation with him.\\" Shelly Sterling indemnified the NBA from damages in future lawsuits from her estranged husband as part of the sale agreement with the league. She negotiated the sale as the sole trustee of the Sterling family trust, which owns LA Clippers LLC, after two neurologists had declared Donald Sterling unable to conduct his own business and legal affairs. The provisions of the family trust did not require a court order. To challenge her authority to conduct the sale, Donald Sterling would have to challenge her in California probate court, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling initially agreed to the sale of the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for 2 billion, but later changed his mind and decided to pursue a 1 billion federal lawsuit against the NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver.

These sirens were not in celebration; they were a cry to the university that something was wrong. A house, only one block away, was on fire. Nine of the university's students lived there. From the minute the word got out that help was needed, it seemed like everyone showed up. The victims of the fire were offered endless invitations for housing for the night. The very next day, everyone got into gear to do their part in helping them. Flyers were posted with items that were immediately needed, just to get these students through this next couple of days. Boxes for donations and money jars were placed in every residence hall . As a residence director, I went before the students in my hall to ask them to do what they could. I knew that college students don't have much, but I asked them to do their best: \\"Every little bit will help.\\" I really didn't think they could do much. I was proved wrong. At the hall council meeting the night after the fire, my residents decided to have a wing competition, where each wing of the building would team up to see who could bring in the most donations. I announced that the wing who won would receive a free pizza party. Thursday evening we announced over the PA system that we were beginning the wing competition. Within minutes, the place exploded. The single large box that I had placed in the lobby was overflowing. We quickly grabbed more boxes, and we watched as they, too, filled to the brim(;).

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Kissing Jessica Stein Context: Twenty-eight-year-old Jessica Stein, a copyeditor living and working in New York City, is plagued by failed blind dates with men, and decides to answer a newspaper's personal advertisement containing a quote from Rilke that she had read and admired earlier. The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men. Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sickâwhich she says earlier in the film never happens to herâJessica is there to care for her. The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica. Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup. It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother... The answer is:","completion":"Jessica is in a relationship with Helen Cooper. This is based on the given context mentioning multiple instances where Jessica is dating Helen, showing affection and compatibility, and even eventually graduating to full intimacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information: - Jesus , Interrupted : Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible ( And Why We Do n't Know About Them ) is a book by Bart D. Ehrman , a New Testament scholar at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . This work includes a narrative of Ehrman 's own progression in Biblical studies and beliefs , an overview of the issues raised by scholarly analysis of the Bible , details of a selection of findings from such analysis , and an exhortation regarding the importance of coming to understand the Bible more fully . Regarding the importance of Biblical study , Ehrman says in the preface , \`\` This kind of information is relevant not only to scholars like me , who devote their lives to serious research , but also to everyone who is interested in the Bible -- whether they personally consider themselves believers or not . In my opinion this really matters . Whether you are a believer -- fundamentalist , evangelical , moderate , liberal -- or a nonbeliever , the Bible is the most significant book in the history of our civilization . Coming to understand what it actually is , and is not , is one of the most important intellectual endeavors that anyone in our society can embark upon . '' One particular statement from early on appears to summarize the development of the subject matter that Ehrman attempts to cover in this volume : \`\` Scholars of the Bible have made significant progress in understanding the Bible over the past two hundred years , building on archaeological discoveries , advances in our knowledge of the ancient Hebrew and Greek languages in which the book of Scripture were originally written , and deep and penetrating historical , literary , and textual analyses . '' Rich Barlow , of the Boston Globe , writes that \`\` he repeatedly stresses that historical - critical study need not kill faith . And , honest scholar that he is , he admits that some of his contentions can be challenged . '' - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books. - Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the \\"Tanakh\\", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others). - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - Textual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification of textual variants in either manuscripts or printed books. Ancient scribes made alterations when copying manuscripts by hand. Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic might seek to reconstruct the original text (the archetype or autograph) as closely as possible. The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate versions, or recensions, of a document's transcription history. The ultimate objective of the textual critic's work is the production of a \\"critical edition\\" containing a scholarly curated text. - Bart Denton Ehrman (born October 5, 1955) is an American professor and scholar, currently the James A. Gray Distinguished Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is one of North America's leading scholars in his field, having written and edited 30 books, including three college textbooks. He has also achieved acclaim at the popular level, authoring five \\"New York Times\\" bestsellers. Ehrman's work focuses on textual criticism of the New Testament, the historical Jesus, and the development of early Christianity. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Chapel Hill is a city in Orange County, North Carolina (with some eastern portions in Durham County), and the home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and UNC Health Care. The population was 57,233 at the 2010 census; Chapel Hill is the 16th-largest municipality in North Carolina. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Early Christianity is the period of Christianity preceding the First Council of Nicaea in 325. It is typically divided into the Apostolic Age and the Ante-Nicene Period (from the Apostolic Age until Nicea). - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - The title of oldest public university in the United States is claimed by three universities: the University of Georgia, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and The College of William and Mary. Each has a distinct basis for the claim, North Carolina being the first to graduate a class, Georgia being the first created by charter, and William & Mary having the oldest founding date of any currently public university, though it was private for over 250 years. - The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, also known as UNC, or simply Carolina, is a public research university located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States. After being chartered in 1789, the university first began enrolling students in 1795, which also allows it to be one of three schools to claim the title of the oldest public university in the United States. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.

Today, we are going to talk about some new ideas that people have for making the way courts work better and save a lot of money. You see, there are two different types of courts called the \\"Magistrates Court\\" and the \\"Crown Court.\\" These are places where people go if they have done something wrong, like taking something that does not belong to them or hurting someone. When people go to these courts, there are 12 people called the \\"jury\\" who listen to the story and help decide if the person did something wrong. But, having these juries can be expensive.

After you've done a lot of cleaning, but you still have a lot to go, take a break. Good job.","completion":"The most logical next event after taking a break from cleaning and organizing your house is to identify and prioritize the remaining tasks, then resume the cleaning process with a renewed focus and energy. 1. Evaluate the remaining tasks: Before jumping back into the cleaning and organizing process, take a few minutes to evaluate what tasks are left and prioritize them according to their importance. This will help you create a plan of action for effectively completing the remaining tasks. 2. Break tasks into manageable chunks: If you have a significant amount of cleaning left, it may seem overwhelming. Break your tasks down into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, instead of trying to clean the entire kitchen at once, focus on one cupboard or drawer at a time. This will help you stay focused and make the process feel more manageable. 3. Set a timer: Having a timer can be a great way to stay focused and encouraged when cleaning. Set a timer for 20-30 minutes and try to complete your current task within the allotted time. Once the timer goes off, take a short 5-minute break before jumping back into another task. 4. Declutter as you go: When organizing your house, you are likely to discover items that you no longer need, use, or want. Use this opportunity to declutter your living space by sorting these items into three categories: keep, donate, and discard. Keep only essential items, donate gently used items to charity, and discard items that are broken or no longer of use. 5. Organize items based on frequency of use and accessibility: As you go through your belongings and reorganize them, consider how often you use each item and arrange them accordingly. Items that are used daily or frequently should be placed in easily accessible locations, while items that are used less often can be stored in higher shelves or more out-of-the-way areas. 6. Maintain a clean environment: Once you've finished cleaning and organizing your house, it's essential to maintain an orderly space by regularly picking up after yourself and staying on top of your chores. Creating a cleaning schedule can help you continue to manage your home efficiently and ensure that it remains a comfortable environment. 7. Reward yourself: After completing the remaining tasks and admiring your clean and organized space, reward yourself for a job well done. You can do this by indulging in a favorite activity, treating yourself to a special meal, or simply enjoying some relaxation time in your refreshed and decluttered living space. By following these steps, you will not only continue to make progress in cleaning and organizing your house but also maintain a sense of accomplishment and motivation throughout the process."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The Dark Eyes of London is a 1939 British horror film directed by Walter Summers, starring Béla Lugosi and Greta Gynt. The film is an adaptation of the 1924 novel of the same name by Edgar Wallace. The film is about a scientist named Dr. Orloff who commits a series of murders for insurance money, while periodically disguising himself as the blind manager of a charity to further his scheme. Can we draw the following conclusion? Bela Lugosi is dead.","completion":"Step 1: Determine the lifespan of a human being On average, a human being lives for about 70-90 years. This data can be considered when trying to establish the likelihood of Bela Lugosi being alive or dead. Step 2: Determine the birthdate of Bela Lugosi Bela Lugosi was born on October 20, 1882. Step 3: Calculate Bela Lugosi's age at the time of the film The film was released in 1939, so Bela Lugosi would have been (1939 - 1882) = 57 years old at the time of the film's release. Step 4: Determine if Bela Lugosi's age and the current year (2022) exceed a human's average lifespan Adding 70 years to Lugosi's age at the time of the film release: 57 (Lugosi's age in 1939) + 70 (human's average lifespan) = 127 Step 5: Compare the result from step 4 to the current year Current year: 2022 As 2022 is much more recent than 127 years after 1939 (which would be 2066 based on the result from step 4), it is very likely that Bela Lugosi is no longer alive. Step 6: Look up Bela Lugosi's death A quick search reveals that Bela Lugosi passed away on August 16, 1956. Conclusion: Based on the average human lifespan, Bela Lugosi's age, and the confirmation of his death in 1956, it can be concluded that Bela Lugosi is dead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Consider all negative consequences.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Be Aware of Eavesdropping Laws: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding and Considering the Negative Consequences Introduction In today's highly connected world, access to information has never been easier. With the simplicity of a single click or a swipe on our devices, we open ourselves up to a vast array of digital information. Alongside this new age of technology comes the elevated threat of eavesdropping or spying on private conversations. Whether intentional or unintentional, eavesdropping puts the rights of both parties at risk, opening up the possibility for significant legal consequences. This article aims to provide you with a comprehensive guide to understanding eavesdropping laws and how to protect yourself and others from the negative consequences arising from it. So, before you engage in a casual conversation or decide to share sensitive information, ask yourself: \\"Am I aware of eavesdropping laws?\\" I. The Legal Landscape of Eavesdropping Eavesdropping laws vary significantly by country and jurisdiction, but the core principle is the protection of privacy rights and the prevention of unauthorized access to private conversations. These laws cover both oral and electronic communication, generally making it illegal to intercept, record or divulge conversations without the consent of at least one party involved. It is crucial for individuals and organizations to understand the specific legal implications of eavesdropping in their locality to avoid potential issues that may arise. a. United States In the U.S., eavesdropping laws are governed both at the federal and state level. The federal law, called the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), protects wire, oral, and electronic communications during transmission by making it illegal to intercept or disclose the contents of such communications without permission. States have different consent standards, falling under either \\"one-party consent\\" or \\"two-party/all-party consent\\" laws. One-party consent states allow recordings as long as one person in the conversation gives their consent. Two-party or all-party consent states, on the other hand, require all parties involved in the conversation to give consent to the recording. It is essential to understand your state's specific eavesdropping laws, as penalties for non-compliance can range from hefty fines to imprisonment. b. United Kingdom The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) regulates eavesdropping in the UK. Under this law, intercepting or recording private communications without the consent of all parties involved is illegal except for specific circumstances such as prevention of crime, protection of national security, or safeguarding public health. Failure to comply with the RIPA can result in criminal charges and possible imprisonment. c. Other Countries Laws and regulations on eavesdropping vary significantly around the world. In countries such as Canada, Australia, and Germany, for instance, it is generally illegal to record a conversation without the consent of all parties involved. Meanwhile, countries like Spain and Brazil follow a one-party consent approach. It is crucial to familiarize yourself with your country's eavesdropping laws to avoid any legal repercussions. II. Negative Consequences of Eavesdropping Not only does eavesdropping pose the risk of legal ramifications, but it can also lead to various negative consequences to both the eavesdropper and the individuals being spied upon. Some of these consequences include: a. Loss of Trust and Credibility An act of eavesdropping can significantly damage one's reputation and credibility. When eavesdropping is discovered, it erodes trust between parties and can create rifts in both personal and professional relationships. b. Emotional and Psychological Impact Eavesdropping invades an individual's privacy, leaving them feeling vulnerable and exposed. It can lead to feelings of paranoia, anxiety, and depression, especially if the person values their privacy highly. c. Business and Economic Impact In corporate settings, eavesdropping can pose risks to business operations. It can result in the loss of business secrets, intellectual property rights, or sensitive financial information. The uncertainty surrounding these situations can negatively affect stock prices, market share, and overall profitability. III. Protecting Yourself from Eavesdropping To minimize the risk of eavesdropping and its potential negative consequences, both individuals and organizations should consider the following precautions: a. Familiarize yourself with eavesdropping laws and ensure compliance with applicable regulations in your jurisdiction. b. Limit discussions of sensitive information to secure locations or encrypted communication channels. c. Regularly update and strengthen your digital security, such as upgrading passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and maintaining software patches. d. Be cautious of oversharing information or engaging in conversations in public spaces where eavesdropping may occur. e. In workplaces, create privacy policies and implement clear guidelines on handling sensitive information and recording conversations. Conclusion Awareness of eavesdropping laws and considering the possible negative consequences is an essential first step in protecting oneself and others from privacy violations. By understanding your jurisdiction's legal landscape and taking necessary precautions, you can minimize eavesdropping risks and safeguard the privacy of your communications. Always ask yourself, \\"Am I aware of eavesdropping laws,\\" and make informed decisions when engaging in private conversations or sharing sensitive information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tashman was best known for her supporting roles as tongue-in-cheek villainesses and the vindictive \\"other woman.\\" She made 66 films over the course of her Hollywood career and although she never obtained superstar status, her cinematic performances are described as \\"sharp, clever and have aged little over the decades.\\" Tall, blonde, and slender with fox-like features and a throaty voice, Tashman freelanced as a fashion and artist's model in New York City. Context: In 1932, Tashman entered the hospital in New York City for an appendectomy that is now considered a concealment for abdominal cancer. She left the hospital thin and weak. Although she made five films in her last years, performing with her usual artistry and professionalism, she weakened significantly in the months following her hospitalization and her role in Riptide was trimmed because of her ever-worsening health. In February 1934, she flew to New York City to film Frankie and Johnny for All Star Productions (released by Republic Pictures) but her condition necessitated a week of rest in Connecticut with Lowe. She resumed work in March, completing her film role on March 8 and then appearing at the Israel Orphan's Home benefit on March 10. When she entered the hospital for surgery on March 16, it was too late for the doctors to help her. Tashman died of cancer at Doctor's Hospital in New York City on March 21, 1934 at the age of 37. Her funeral was held on March 22 in New York City synagogue Temple Emanu-El with Sophie Tucker, Mary Pickford, Fanny Brice, Cecil Beaton, Jack Benny, and other distinguished celebrities in attendance. Eddie Cantor delivered the eulogy. The burial in Brooklyn's Washington Cemetery attracted 10,000 fans, mourners, and curious onlookers; it became a near riot when people were injured and a gravestone was toppled. Tashman left no will, but the distribution of her 31,000 in cash and 121,000 in furs and jewels provoked contentious discussion among her husband and sisters, Hattie and Jennie. Her last film, Frankie and Johnny, was released posthumously in May 1936 with her role as Nellie Bly cut to a cameo. Question: Was she buried there? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Lilyan Tashman was buried at Washington Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Her funeral had many famous celebrities in attendance, and her burial attracted a big crowd of 10,000 people, including fans, mourners, and curious onlookers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Two of Moammar Gadhafi's sons, who had been reported captured over the weekend, were free early Tuesday as forces loyal to the embattled Libyan leader battled rebels trying to consolidate their hold on Tripoli. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi showed up at the Rixos Hotel, one of the remaining strongholds of pro-Gadhafi forces, in a convoy of armored Land Cruisers.

FBI director James Comey wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday to inform it that the FBI would be looking at a number of previously undiscovered emails to see if they contain classified information. \\"In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,\\" NBC News quotes the letter as stating. The AP reports the new emails were not found on Clinton's private email server. They were found on devices belonging to Clinton aide Huma Abedin and husband Anthony Weiner, according to the New York Times. They were found while the FBI investigates Weiner for allegedly sexting a 15-year-old girl. It's unclear what's in the new emails, the Los Angeles Times reports. Regardless, Comey says he wants the FBI to look into whether the emails contain classified information. In his letter, Comey admits that it's impossible to say whether the new emails will be important one way or another, Reuters reports. He also says he \\"cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work.\\" According to CNBC, the stock market dropped as news of Comey's letter spread.

A special group called the FBI, whose job is to make sure everyone follows the rules, looked into the situation to see if Hillary had done anything wrong.

The FBI is checking these new emails to see if there's any important secret information in them, but they don't know yet if this will change their decision or how long it'll take them to finish checking everything. This news made some people feel uncertain, so they got scared and the stock market dropped a little bit.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects’ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor’s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose from: [+] no; [+] yes;","completion":"[+] no; The questions you asked are not the same. Let me address each question individually to provide a clearer understanding. 1. Stock option par value vs. exercise price: Par value and exercise price are two distinct concepts related to stock options. - Par value: This is a nominal value given to a company's stock and is used to determine the minimum price at which the stock can be issued. Par value has little significance in today's modern markets, as most stocks have a very low or no par value. - Exercise price (also known as the strike price): This is the price at which a stock option holder can buy (in case of a call option) or sell (in case of a put option) the underlying stock. It is determined by the company when granting stock options, and generally, the exercise price is set at the fair market value of the company's stock on the grant date. 2. What to look for in the stock option agreement to know if your stock options can be exercised early: To find out if your stock options can be exercised early (before they are fully vested), you should look for the following provisions in your stock option agreement: - Vesting schedule: This specifies the timeline for when your options will become exercisable. Typically, options vest over a period of time, such as four years, with a one-year cliff. If your agreement allows for early exercise, it will be mentioned in the vesting schedule section. - Early exercise provision: Some stock option agreements include an \\"early exercise\\" provision, which allows you to exercise your options before they are fully vested. This can be beneficial in situations where you anticipate significant growth in the company's stock value. - Accelerated vesting provision: This is a clause that may allow for a faster vesting of your options under certain conditions, such as a change in control of the company or meeting specific performance goals. This is not exactly an early exercise provision but can impact the exercise timing. By reviewing these provisions in your stock option agreement, you can determine whether your options can be exercised early or not."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

We went with a blue carpet instead of doing the hard wood floor, because the Options are: --floor was cleaner. --carpet was cleaner.","completion":"We went with a blue carpet instead of doing the hard wood floor, because the carpet was cleaner. This decision came after thorough comparisons and considerations, weighing the pros and cons of each flooring option. One of the main benefits of opting for a carpeted floor is the undeniable comfort it provides. Carpets are soft and warm underfoot, making them ideal for rooms where people will be walking around barefoot or children will be playing on the floor. The plush, thick fibers also create a cozy and welcoming atmosphere, opposed to the comparatively cold and hard touch of a hardwood floor. Additionally, noise reduction is a significant advantage of choosing a carpet over a hardwood floor. Carpets are excellent at absorbing sound, which helps to minimize the echoing and reverberation often associated with hardwood floors. This makes for a quieter and more serene environment, particularly when there are multiple people walking around or engaging in various activities within the same space. Another factor that led us to choose a blue carpet over the hardwood floor is the overall ease of maintenance and cleanliness. Carpets, contrary to popular belief, are actually easier to clean than hardwood floors, as long as they are well-maintained and taken care of. With a carpet, the daily chore of sweeping and mopping is no longer necessary, as a simple vacuuming will suffice. In our case, the blue color also helps in hiding minor stains and dirt, which would be more visible on a hardwood floor. Furthermore, carpeted floors offer enhanced safety, especially for families with young children or elderly people. Slipping accidents on hard surfaces such as hardwood floors can lead to severe injuries, whereas the friction from carpets provides a safer walking surface and can cushion falls to some extent. This extra layer of protection played a crucial role in our decision-making process. Finally, the aesthetics of the blue carpet were more appealing, complementing our interior design. While hardwood floors have a timeless appeal, their lack of customization options can make them feel generic and unexciting. On the other hand, the blue carpet added a unique touch of color and texture that matched well with our furniture and décor, creating a cohesive and stylish look. In conclusion, we went with a blue carpet instead of the hardwood floor because it offered significant advantages in terms of cleanliness, comfort, noise reduction, safety, and aesthetics. Ultimately, the blue carpet was the ideal choice for our space, meeting both our functional needs and design preferences."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Solve this instance: By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Owners of large air-vented dryers and condensing dryers under the Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda brands may need to have them fixed. Parent company Whirlpool said eight million affected dryers had been sold in the last 11 years, including five million in the UK. So far, 70,000 cases had been resolved. Other customers are facing a long wait for a visit. Some have reported an eight-week waiting list. \\"Given the large number of dryers affected, we currently have a wait time of many weeks before the repair service can be completed,\\" the company, which has 1,000 engineers, said. \\"This is not up to our high standard of service and we are working to address it.\\" More than three million people are being written to about the safety notice, with 1.8 million expected to receive letters in the next two to three weeks. Online checker Whirlpool bought manufacturer Indesit, including the Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda brands, in October 2014. Investigations into reports of fires led eventually to the huge programme of alerts and repairs announced in November. The company is asking owners to check whether their machine is one of those affected and, if so, to contact the company through Hotpoint's dedicated website or the matching Indesit site. The model number, usually found on the back of the dryer door, can be entered in the online checker. If action is needed, an engineer will visit to mend the machine - a process that the company said could take an hour. Letters The company has written to 1.5 million customers so far, and expects to contact a further 1.8 million by the start of February. The company said a substantial number of the millions of dryers sold over the last 11 years would have been replaced or scrapped. So far, more than 625,000 customers have registered for a repair, the company said. With many facing a lengthy wait, the company said it was offering discounts on new products for those whose appliance was more than two years old. While waiting for a repair, owners are being advised not to use their dryer when they are out of the house or asleep, and to clean the filter after every cycle. Register warning Earlier this month, charity Electrical Safety First urged shoppers to register their electrical products with the manufacturer in order to receive details of any recalls. It said faulty appliances, in general, caused £41.6m of damage in the UK every year and 46 deaths were caused each year by electrical fires. Since 2011 there have been more than 300 different recalled electrical items, and the charity said that the success rate for recalling items in the UK was rarely higher than 10% to 20%. \\"We know electrical products are high on shopping lists this sale season so we are urging the public to keep their families and homes safe by making a habit of registering a new product as soon as they get it home,\\" said Emma Apter, of Electrical Safety First. \\"People may think it's too much hassle or there is no benefit of providing contact details but an unregistered appliance can be a hidden danger in homes as it's difficult for manufacturers to trace them.\\" Student:","completion":"Whirlpool addresses safety concerns by offering repairs for eight million potentially faulty dryers under Hotpoint, Indesit, and Creda brands, sold over the last 11 years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. By. Jane Fryer. The view from Tim and Sheila Wilmot’s bedroom window is, frankly, rather astonishing. Palm trees as high as houses sway in the breeze, 15ft banana trees stand firm, Chinese windmill palms droop with huge clusters of green and purple seeds. There are enormous spiky agave plants, money trees the size of small bears, a 5ft bird of paradise. Scroll down for video. Jeepers creepers! Tim Wilmot, centre, is pictured surrounded by the exotic blooms of his garden in a suburb of Bristol - the product of decades' hard work. The air is sweet and hot and damp. You can hear water tinkling in the distance. All that’s missing is a troop of screaming monkeys swinging from liana to liana and a venomous snake or two. Vast ferns rustle in the shade - is that a tiger breaking cover? No, of course not. Don’t be so silly. Because Tim, 56, and Sheila, 60, don’t actually live anywhere near the Amazon rainforest, deep in the Congo or even in a particularly tropical spot of the Mediterranean. Home is a modern detached house in the sprawling commuter village of Yate, on the outskirts of Bristol, 50 yards from a thundering bypass. Neighbouring gardens boast neatly clipped lawns, conservatories, rose beds and nylon washing lines. But Tim, who runs his own software company, prefers things a bit more tropical. ‘I don’t know why. It’s a good question. I’ve never lived in the tropics. I’ve never lived abroad. I wasn’t even particularly interested in gardening when I was growing up,’ he says. Ready for action: Tim poses above with a pair of garden shears. He spends hours every day tending to his array of plants, which hail from all over the world. Could you guess? From the front Tim Wilmot's home in Yate, not far from Bristol and yards from a thundering bypass - looks like any other home. ‘But 20 or 30 years ago we’d go on summer holidays and I’d spend all my time looking at jelly palms and Canary Island palms and think: “Wow! I’d love one of those in my garden. One day...” ’ The Wilmot family moved in when son Max, now 25, was still a baby, Toby, now 21, wasn’t even a glint in the eye and the garden was, well, just as you’d expect a suburban garden to be. Nice big patio, beech hedge, leylandii, apple trees, decent stretch of grass, a bright orange Ronsealed fence, ornamental pagoda and not a banana tree or shrieking chimpanzee in sight. ‘It was fine for a bit. But no one else in the family is into gardening, so I just sort of started doing my own thing. I didn’t ask permission,’ says Tim. He is a self-taught amateur gardener. But, bit by bit, with the help of gardening books, information from the internet and trial and error, he transformed this quarter of an acre into looking like a painting by Henri Rousseau. Down came the beech hedge and the apple trees and the pagoda. The leylandii were ripped up and replaced with a bamboo plantation. In went jelly palms from South America, banana trees, ferns, ornamental cacti, yuccas, succulents, gunneras (which looks a bit like monster prehistoric spiky rhubarb) and rice paper plants. ‘I had a few tropical plants in our last garden, but they were all in pots and just waiting to be let loose.’ Once unleashed, they must have gone mad. Because today everything is massive, enormous, jungle-sized. The banana leaves are like sails. The foliage of the gunnera measures six foot across. The rice paper plant leaves are the size of coffee tables. Hours' work: Tim spends more than two hours every day watering his garden during dry spells - and has luckily never been hit by a hose-pipe ban. Despite his modesty, maintaining a jungle garden on the outskirts of Bristol isn’t simply a combination of gentle pruning and swinging like Tarzan through the foliage. ‘It’d be easier in London or down in the South-West - we’re in a frost pocket here.’ So during winter, Tim spends hours hunched over his own weather station checking for cold snaps and high winds, erecting vast home-made polytunnels made of curved drainpipes and polythene over his prized agaves (from sunny Mexico) and lovingly wrapping his tender palms and bananas in horticultural fleece. ‘I get very twitchy when it’s cold. I’ll be out there at three in the morning in my dressing gown, putting extra layers of fleece on.’ He also spreads ten bales of straw round the bases of the banana plants, builds plant shelters and decants the pot plants into a purpose-built greenhouse. This sounds a breeze, until you remember that many are 10ft and weigh half-a-ton each. ‘It takes three days with the help of Max to get them all in. They hate the cold, so I have a fan heater going to keep the temperature above three or four degrees.’ Humble roots: Mr Wilmot's gardening ambitions began with a few humble palm trees, but became more audacious over time. Then, come spring, he has to reverse the whole process, hoping and praying no lasting damage has been done. ‘It’s only in the spring you can tell if the palm trees are OK. They’re still green, but the central spear will go mushy and collapse. It’s very sad. ‘I have vision of how it should all look and then I end up with a blank spot in the garden. I’m very critical and I want everything to be perfect.’ Does Sheila get irritated, what with him buzzing in and out all night in his pyjamas, fussing over the palms? ‘Yes. I tend to get a bit engrossed and everything I do in the garden takes twice as long as I tell her it will. ‘But I think she minds more in the summer, when we could be going out for the evening and I’m busy watering.’ And watering, and watering. During a dry spell, he’ll spend at least two hours a night watering. ‘You could put a hose-pipe on a banana all day and they’d lap it up. They could live in water.’ Perfectionist: Tim admits to spending hours more than planed in his garden - and has reached the point where it is so full there is no extra room unless something dies. Happily, the Wilmots’ house was built in 1988, just before water meters were introduced. But what about hose-pipe bans? ‘We’ve never had a hose-pipe ban here, only a sprinkler ban. But I’ve got a well and a pump for emergencies.’ Over the years, there have been disasters - ‘I’ve had terrible losses with my tender palms’ - and triumphs. ‘It’s a very big moment when one of the banana trees produces a banana - you can’t eat them, of course. They’re small and there’s no flesh in them. But the flower! Ah, it’s a Triffid-like flower. It’s very exciting.’ Tim’s garden has won endless prizes, been featured in magazines and BBC TV’s Gardeners’ World and is open to the public every year as part of the National Gardens Scheme (the next open day is Sunday, September 14). And today, finally, after 25 years of hard work, it is finished. ‘It’s done, it’s full. To be honest, it’s a bit of a relief. I can’t fit anything else in, so it’s a one-in-one-out system when something dies.’ And, rude question, but what about the cost of it all? Extensive: Much of the garden, pictured in the height of summer, is packed away in colder months. Exotic: The puya plant, pictured, originally comes from the mountainous Andres, but can survive in Bristol. Vibrant: Mr WIlmot's plants, such as this golden bamboo, are usually found thousands of miles away. ‘People always go on and on about the money, but I don’t think it’s that much - £10,000 altogether. You could spend that on a golf club subscription. It’s a hobby and it’s exercise, so it’s good value for money. And all my family get to enjoy it, too. We even had the sitting room windows made bigger so we could all see it better.’ But what if they ever move? ‘I’ll have to leave the plants behind. Maybe I’d donate some to Kew Gardens for their hot house.’ The garden would not appeal to everyone. Today there’s just teeny scrap of lawn left. Barely space for a washing line. The tropical plants dominates totally and utterly. But it is magnificent. The views from the house are extraordinary. Sit on their sofa and it really feels as if you’re in a jungle. The only thing missing is colour. ‘There’s loads of colour! It’s all colour!’ he says, outraged. But it’s all green. What about flowers? A rose or two or clematis? Tim shudders. ‘I see no attraction in roses or clematis. None whatsoever. They get diseases, they need lots of attention and everyone else is growing them. What’s the point?’ And what about the neighbours? ‘They don’t seem to be that into gardening. But I have noticed the odd bamboo springing up. And more palm trees. ‘Maybe it’ll catch on and in 30 years this whole area will be one big jungle.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article describes the astonishing transformation of Tim and Sheila Wilmot's garden in Yate, a commuter village on the outskirts of Bristol, England.

Faith No More (sometimes abbreviated as FNM) is an American rock band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1979. Before settling on their current name in 1982, the band performed under the names Sharp Young Men and later Faith No Man. Bassist Billy Gould and drummer Mike Bordin are the longest remaining members of the band, having been involved with Faith No More since its inception. Faith No More displayed an even more experimental effort on their next album, Angel Dust. One critic writes that the album is \\"one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label\\" and another writes that the single \\"'A Small Victory', which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers (...) reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions.\\" Aside from \\"A Small Victory\\" (which received a nomination for Best Art Direction at the MTV Video Music Awards), the tracks \\"Midlife Crisis\\" and \\"Everything's Ruined\\" were also released as singles. The album included a re-recording of the theme to the film Midnight Cowboy, and later pressings included a cover of The Commodores \\"Easy\\", which in some parts of the world became the band's biggest hit. Angel Dust, though not as successful as The Real Thing in the US, sold 665,000 copies there, and managed to outsell The Real Thing in many other countries. In Germany, the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 250,000 copies. The album also matched the sales of The Real Thing in Canada (Platinum), Australia (Gold), and surpassed it in the Netherlands, France, Russia, and the UK. Worldwide sales are around 3.1 million copies. After touring to support Angel Dust in the summer of 1993, long-time guitarist Jim Martin left the band due to internal conflicts. He was reportedly unhappy with the band's change in musical direction on Angel Dust, describing it as \\"gay disco\\". According to Roddy Bottum, Martin was fired via fax. However, Martin himself states it was his decision to leave. Both Godflesh guitarist Justin Broadrick and Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker were reportedly offered to join Faith No More after Martin's departure, but declined to join. The position was filled by Mike Patton's bandmate from Mr. Bungle, Trey Spruance, who left soon after recording 1995's King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime and just before the band was to begin their world tour.

Howard was born in Atlanta, to Dwight Sr. and Sheryl Howard, and into a family with strong athletic connections. His father is a Georgia State Trooper and serves as Athletic Director of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the best high school basketball programs in the country, while his mother played on the inaugural women's basketball team at Morris Brown College. Howard's mother had seven miscarriages before he was born. A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine; when in the eighth grade, he resolved to be selected as the number one pick in the NBA Draft one day. Before he was drafted in 2004, Howard said that he wanted to use his NBA career and Christian faith to \\"raise the name of God within the league and throughout the world\\". He has stated he believes in reaching out to his community and fans and thus contributes substantially in the field of philanthropy. An avid listener of Gospel music, he attends the Fellowship of Faith Church when he is back home in Atlanta and is involved and active with the youth programs at the church. Together with his parents, Howard also established the Dwight D. Howard Foundation Inc. in 2004. The Foundation provides scholarships for students who want to attend his alma mater, Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, and grants to Lovell Elementary School and Memorial Middle School in Orlando, Florida. The Foundation also organizes summer basketball camps for boys and girls, and together with high school and college coaches and players, fellow NBA players are invited to be on hand at the camp. For his contributions in the Central Florida community, Howard received in 2005 the Rich and Helen De Vos Community Enrichment Award. Within the NBA itself, Howard has participated in several NBA \\"Read to Achieve\\" assemblies encouraging children to make reading a priority. In November 2009, the center was named one of the 10 finalists for the Jefferson Awards for Public Service, which awards athletes for their charitable work. In 2009, Howard, along with several other NBA players, joined the Hoops for St. Jude charity program benefitting the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Elsewhere, Howard appeared as a special guest on an episode of the ABC series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that aired April 2, 2006, in which Ty Pennington and his team built a new home and ministry offices for Sadie Holmes, who operates a social services ministry in the Orlando area. He made another appearance on the show in the October 9, 2011 episode. Along with Sam Worthington and Jonah Hill, Howard appeared in a commercial for the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Howard, along with Carmelo Anthony and Scottie Pippen, also appeared in the 2013 Chinese film Amazing, a joint venture between the NBA and Shanghai Film Group Corporation.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are fewer trees happens, how will it affect MORE/LARGER nests. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context suggests that if there were fewer trees available, it would potentially affect the construction of more or larger bird nests. This hypothesis could result in a few direct and indirect effects on the bird nesting process: 1. Limited nesting sites: With fewer trees, there would be limited nesting sites for birds, leading to increased competition among them. Birds that usually construct larger nests might have to opt for smaller ones or pick less suitable trees to accommodate their nests. 2. Limited construction materials: A decrease in the number of trees would also lead to a reduction in the available twigs and other materials used for nest construction. Birds might have to compromise their nest structure and stability by utilizing alternative or less preferred materials to build their nests. 3. Effect on bird populations: As larger or more nests are affected by the lack of trees, the overall bird population could be indirectly impacted. This is because a decrease in available nesting resources might lead to a reduction in reproductive success and lower their populations in the long run. 4. Altered nesting behavior: Birds might adjust their nesting behaviors in response to a diminished number of trees. For example, they might switch to building nests on the ground, different structures, or in the remaining trees in more densely packed congregations, resulting in altered bird distribution patterns and social behaviors. 5. Effects on other species and ecosystems: The shortage of trees and its effect on bird nests might also have indirect effects on other species. As birds adjust their behaviors, they might interact more with predators, parasites, or competitors, affecting overall ecosystem health and structure. In conclusion, the perturbation of having fewer trees would likely have both direct and indirect effects on the construction of more or larger bird nests. The altered availability of nesting sites and materials could lead to changes in nesting behavior, bird populations, and broader ecosystem dynamics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pioneering work by Broca (1878), Papez (1937), and MacLean (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures. More recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.\\".

The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south, although the northern (primarily Germany, France and Great Britain) and southern universities (primarily Italy) did have many elements in common. Latin was the language of the university, used for all texts, lectures, disputations and examinations. Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics; while Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna were used for medicine. Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology. There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus, so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means. There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities. English, French and German universities usually awarded bachelor's degrees, with the exception of degrees in theology, for which the doctorate was more common. Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates. The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation – in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions, while in the south students often went on to professional positions. The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the University of Paris. Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna. Among the southern universities, a further distinction has been noted between those of northern Italy, which followed the pattern of Bologna as a \\"self-regulating, independent corporation of scholars\\" and those of southern Italy and Iberia, which were \\"founded by royal and imperial charter to serve the needs of government.\\" Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What types of subjects did the universities of Bolonga focus on?","completion":"The University of Bologna, located in Italy, is one of the oldest universities in the world and played a significant role in shaping the development of Italian and Southern European university culture.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person whose competent performance persuaded others their problems were in the past? from the following article ? In selecting his crew, De Long's priority was men with Arctic experience. For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins. Dubbed \\"chief scientist,\\" he was in charge of the Edison apparatus and of a rudimentary telephone system that De Long hoped to utilize. The remaining places were filled from a long list of applicants; the cook and steward were recruited by Danenhower from San Francisco's Chinatown.

This event holds significant importance in modern history, as it led to major global changes in security, foreign policy, and approaches to fighting terrorism. It appears that the narrator has a personal connection or a strong emotional attachment to the event and its significance. Their custom to spend time reflecting in the morning, particularly on this anniversary, demonstrates their desire to honor the memory of those who lost their lives and the profound impact this tragedy had on the world. Mentioning the beautiful day in NYC, the amazing sky, and the beautiful sunlight paints a vivid picture, and the contrast between the seemingly normal and picturesque morning and the devastating events that unfolded later that day can also serve as a reminder of the unpredictability of life. Remembering 9/11 has become an annual tradition for many in the United States and around the world. The devastating loss of life and the lasting effects on those who survived have made the event a somber and poignant reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of unity and resilience in the face of adversity. Commemorations range from moments of silence, memorial services, and the sharing of personal stories to educational programs and discussions for better understanding and learning from the event. In summary, the narrator is commemorating the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, a pivotal and tragic event in recent history that has had profound and lasting effects on both personal and global levels.

The test flight fails as his right wing breaks, sending him crashing into the Seine River. Later after the incident, Woody is asked by his friend, CIA file clerk Harry, to perform what appears to be a civilian paper swap in Istanbul. Upon arriving in Istanbul, he meets a beautiful Soviet named Natalia Rambova, who poses as the Soviet civilian with whom the exchange is supposed to take place, but it is later revealed that she is in fact a KGB spy. Woody does not tell Natalia his real name, and instead fabricates his identity to her as a top American agent code-named \\"Condorman\\". During the encounter, Woody fends off a group of would-be assassins and saves her life by sheer luck before accomplishing the paper trade. Impressed by Woody, and disgusted by how she was treated by her lover/boss Krokov when she returns to Moscow, Natalia decides to defect and asks the CIA to have \\"Condorman\\" be the agent that helps her.Back in Paris, Woody's encounter with Natalia inspires him to create a super heroine patterned after her named \\"Laser Lady\\". He is then notified by Harry and his boss Russ that he is to escort a defecting Soviet agent known as \\"The Bear\\". Woody refuses to do the job, but when Russ reveals that \\"The Bear\\" is Natalia, he agrees to do it on the condition that the CIA provides him with gadgetry based on his designs.Woody meets up with Natalia in Yugoslavia and protects her from Krokov's henchmen led by the homicidal, glass-eyed assassin Morovich.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It can be difficult to focus on your online course if you have a social media account open in another tab or are receiving notifications on your computer. When you’re doing classwork, avoid browsing the Internet, checking your email, and other distractions. If necessary, you can install an app that will restrict your access to certain websites during a designated period of time so you can focus on your studies. Never go into a study session undirected. Have specific goals each time you sit down to study. You can break the material up into chunks and study one chunk at a time. Make a schedule for yourself, with individual study sessions divided by topic. You should also remember your overall academic goals when you study. This can help with your motivation. Think about how a good grade will contribute to your overall GPA. Think about how the material will benefit you after the course. Simple memorization can only go so far. One of the most effective means to memorize material is giving yourself tests and quizzes. Quizzing can improve memorization because of a process called \\"retrieval.\\" Every time a memory is retrieved, it becomes more accessible in the future. If there are practice tests and quizzes available online, take as many as you can. You can also make up tests and quizzes for yourself. Flashcards can be a great way to test yourself on things like vocabulary and dates. You can also write down potential exam questions as you study. This can be very helpful if you're expecting an essay test. After you finish studying, take the test you made for yourself. Studying for long hours can easily lead to burnout. It's important to take breaks as you study. Take a break about every hour or so. Do something fun, like watch TV for a few minutes or go for a brief walk, and then return to your materials. You will find yourself feeling refreshed and recharged after a quick break. Remember, your instructor in an online course is a valuable resource. Just because you don't see them every day does not mean you can't reach out to them. If you stumble across anything confusing while studying, do not hesitate to send your instructor an email asking for clarification. If you have a web camera, try setting up a video chat meeting with your instructor for face-to-face feedback.","completion":"The article provides tips for effective online learning, covering focusing on studies by avoiding distractions, setting specific goals, using quizzes and flashcards for memorization, taking breaks to prevent burnout, and utilizing instructors as a resource for clarification and guidance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's why: 1. Michigan: While it is a state in the United States, it does not specify a particular place where one could buy a harp. It is a more general location rather than a specific destination for purchasing musical instruments. 2. Concert hall: A concert hall is a venue where concerts and musical performances take place. While one might see or hear harps in concert halls, concert halls do not typically sell musical instruments such as harps. 3. Irish bar: An Irish bar is primarily a liquor-serving establishment that may feature live traditional Irish music. It is not a place where one would go to buy a harp or other musical instruments. 4. Create music: \\"Create music\\" refers to the process or act of composing, playing, or making music, rather than a place to purchase a harp. 5. Music shop: A music shop is a store that specializes in selling musical instruments, accessories, and sometimes sheet music. It is the most appropriate place among the given options for purchasing a harp because they have a selection of instruments and knowledgeable staff who can help guide the buyer.

Therefore, batteries could not be inserted and product was useless. Is the review positive or negative? A:","completion":"The review in question can be classified as a negative review. The reasons for deeming it as negative can be analyzed through several aspects that the reviewer pointed out, which can be summarized and elaborated as follows: 1. Poor Design: The reviewer starts off by mentioning that the design of the product is flawed, which already sets a negative tone. A well-designed product should cater to the needs and expectations of users, but, in this case, they were not met. 2. Battery Compartment Issues: The main complaint expressed by the reviewer is that the battery compartment is too short for the batteries. This is a significant design problem, as it directly impacts the product's functionality. Users expect products to work seamlessly, particularly when it comes to something as essential as a battery compartment. However, this issue prevented the reviewer from using the product as intended. 3. Inability to Insert Batteries: As a consequence of the too-short battery compartment, the reviewer could not insert the batteries. Batteries usually serve as a primary source of power for electronic products, so without them functioning correctly, the product becomes useless. This presents a major inconvenience for the user and contributes to the negative sentiment of the review. 4. Product Uselessness: Due to the complication with the battery compartment and the inability to insert batteries, the reviewer found the product unusable. A product's primary purpose is to serve its intended function, but, in this instance, it failed to do so. This further solidifies the negative tone of the review, as customers rarely appreciate products that they cannot use. 5. Product Return: Finally, the reviewer mentions that they had to return the product, which indicates a strong level of dissatisfaction. Returning a product is usually a last resort when the user encounters insurmountable issues with it. It can be inferred that the customer was extremely dissatisfied with the design and functionality of the product, leading to the return. Taking into account all of these points, it becomes clear that the review is negative. The customer experienced several problems with the product, suffered from its poor design, and ultimately found it useless. This negative review reflects the overall sentiment that the product did not meet user expectations and, therefore, is not recommended for others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Question: Why did Meade lose his civil rights? Options: A. politicians stripped him of his civil rights. B. he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier. C. not enough information D. he became a convicted felon. === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"B. he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Having done so, the three meet with Courtley at an abandoned Church for a ceremony during which he puts the dried blood into goblets and mixes it with drops of his own blood, telling the men to drink. They refuse, so he drinks the blood himself, screams and falls to the ground. As he grabs their legs, they kick and beat him, not stopping until Courtley dies, at which they flee.

Sarah could not get the jasmine to fit in the pot because the","completion":"roots had grown far too large for its current container. Her love for gardening had blossomed just as unexpectedly as her flowers. It all started a year ago when a close friend gifted her a small jasmine plant to brighten up her new apartment. Sarah, never having taken care of plants before, approached the task with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism. However, as the days went by and she devoted more time and care to the fragile being, she discovered an inexplicable connection to it. The soothing fragrance of the jasmine flowers filled her small living space, becoming a source of comfort during the long days that meshed into one seemingly never-ending week while working from home. COVID-19 had changed so many aspects of her life; friends and colleagues becoming mere pixelated faces on a screen, routines disrupted, and once familiar places inhabited by the eerie silence of a pandemic-riddled world. Feeling isolated within the confines of her apartment walls, Sarah began seeking connections with the living in a different way. Gardening channels on YouTube, books about plants, blogs on caring for flora – every waking moment spent outside her work life was dedicated to learning more about these quiet beings. Beside the jasmine plant, her apartment was now home to an army of plants. Echeverias adorned the windowsill along with aloe-veras, spider plants held residence on various shelves, and a majestic monstera had its claim on an entire corner. Today though, the jasmine was proving a difficult challenge. Overcome with determination, Sarah decided to enlist the help of the online gardening community. She snapped a photo of the stubborn plant and, with accompanying queries, posted it to her favorite gardening forum. Within moments, her phone screen filled with notifications of replies offering advice. One solution stood out: \\"try the technique of air layering,\\" it read. Intrigued, Sarah researched further and discovered that air layering meant rooting a stem while it was still attached to the parent plant to promote root development before transplanting it into another soil container. Gathering the necessary materials, Sarah carefully followed the instructions for air layering: she dampened some sphagnum moss, made an upward cut into the jasmine's stem, stuck a toothpick in the cut to hold it open and then wrapped the moistened moss around it. She secured the moss with a piece of plastic wrap and some gardening tape. Now, all there was left to do was wait. Over the following weeks, Sarah continued to nurture her plants, all while meticulously checking on the progress of her jasmine's air-layered stem. Gradually, the stem began to develop its own root system, and Sarah beamed with pride at the success of her first attempt at a somewhat advanced gardening technique. Finally, after a month, she decided it was time to separate the stem from the parent plant. Sarah carefully removed the plastic wrap and moss from the stem, revealing a healthy cluster of roots. With a heavy heart, she cut the stem from its connection to the parent jasmine and carefully placed it in a new, larger pot, filled with nutrient-rich soil. Tending to her plants, Sarah felt her isolation ebbed away by the comforting presence of these diverse, living beings. As the jasmine flourished in its larger pot, so did Sarah's understanding of the delicate balance between growth and change. For Sarah, gardening was not just a hobby or a means to bring color to her home; it had become a profound metaphor for life itself, reminding her of the importance of care, connection, and adaptability. And so, the story of Sarah and her jasmine continued, their intertwined existence growing stronger day by day, defying the challenges and uncertainties of the world outside. Together, they were blossoming in a world that desperately needed a reminder of nature's resilience and beauty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you're wearing pants or a skirt with a tight waistband, your clothes could be making matters worse by putting pressure on your bladder. Make yourself as comfortable as possible by loosening your tight clothing. If you're wearing a belt, unbuckle it. Unbutton or unzip your pants or skirt. To hide the fact that you're unbuttoned, pull your shirt down or place a sweater or another item over your lap. For similar reasons, you may also find it helpful to uncross your legs, particularly when sitting. Squirming around jostles your bladder and creates an urge that feels more extreme. You might want feel like tapping your feet or shifting from side to side, but that's just going to make matters worse. Try to get in a comfortable position and stay that way. This is one of the best ways to deal with having to pee on a bus. If there's really nowhere to go to the bathroom for the next hour or two, make the best of the situation by trying to forget about your uncomfortable physical state. Pick up your reading material or turn on a video absorbing enough to keep your mind off of your urge to relieve your bladder. Both of these actions can cause the pelvic floor muscles to give a little, making the urge to pee worse. You probably can't do much about it if you have a coughing fit, but you can make sure the book or video you choose isn't funny enough to make you laugh so hard you pee in your pants. Having an unbearable urge to pee is partly psychological, so thinking about whitewater rafting and spouting geysers really will make you feel worse! Let your mind dwell on deserts (without mirages) and other things that are dry. If you have a mean friend who thinks it's funny to sing \\"Don't Go Chasing Waterfalls\\" while you're trying to hold it in, tell him it won't be so funny if you pee in your seat right next to them. There's no chance that you're going to burst your bladder just by holding your pee for a long time, so let your mind be eased. If it gets to the point where your body can't hold it anymore, it will simply stop doing so. Hopefully by then you'll have gotten to a rest stop!

Suggest we answer that we feel confident that the first mover advantage will give us superior returns in the long run. USA: INTERVIEW-Dynegy feels gradual approach in Europe vindicated. By Andrew Kelly 10/15/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. HOUSTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Natural gas and power marketer Dynegy Inc. said on Monday it felt vindicated in its step-by-step approach to building a business in Europe in view of recent retrenchments by rival Houston-based companies. Dynegy recently opened an office in Madrid to market natural gas, electricity and derivatives. Spain is the fifth country in continental Europe where Dynegy has set up an office since it started up its European operations in Britain in 1994. By contrast Enron Corp. has recently announced plans to cut staffing at its European operations by 5 percent to 10 percent amid concerns about slow and piecemeal progress toward deregulation of European natural gas and electricity markets. \\"Enron threw 800 bodies at it and tried to do it in a hurry. We've been going at it much more slowly because we thought it would take some time,\\" Dynegy President and Chief Operating Officer Steve Bergstrom told Reuters in an interview. Another Dynegy rival, Reliant Resources Inc., said last month it was considering a possible sale of its electricity generation business in the Netherlands. \\"Reliant bought one utility in one country and realized that's not really the way to enter the market in Europe,\\" Bergstrom said of the move which cost Reliant 2.4 billion. Bergstrom said his own company differed with Enron and Reliant in the execution of its entry into the European market, rather than in its assessment of the market's potential. \\"We've gone at this much more cautiously. We've made sure that we staff it appropriately for the market timing and we think we've done it the right way,\\" he said. Bergstrom said there were similar differences between Dynegy and Enron's approach to the broadband telecommunications market where Enron has also cut jobs after admitting that it probably overestimated the market's short-term potential. \\"They're having to retrench, but you're not hearing them give up on the telecommunications business. Our cost structure is so much less than theirs, that's why we're a lot more optimistic, because they have to go through cutting a bunch of costs whereas we never added those costs,\\" he said. Dynegy reported on Monday its third-quarter net earnings rose 62 percent as its wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. Dynegy has said it expects its broadband business, created late last year, to generate a positive net income next year. The business posted a 15 million loss in the third quarter of 2001. Dynegy's Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson told analysts in a conference call on Monday that the unit's revenues had doubled in the latest quarter to 8 million. \\"We believe the industry touched the bottom in this communications market in the third quarter, with bandwidth demand picking up sharply in the foreseeable future,\\" Watson said.

Question: What does Lane search through to realize Glass's work was falisified? Title: Shattered Glass Movie plot: It tells the story of Stephen Glass (Hayden Christensen), who was the youngest journalist at the New Republic. This newspaper prides itself to have been read by everybody in the political field in Washington, and to be the only one in the American president's plane. Little by little, we see how things work in the editorial room: Stephen's direct boss and editor is Charles \\"Chuck\\" Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), who is constantly insisting on having every single detail checked through direct notes. The first time Stephen gets in trouble in the film it's on an article about a Republican young people convention, where he alleged they got drunk and called some prostitutes. Stephen gets into trouble because the hotel manager complains that hotel rooms did not have any drink or food fridges in them, all the opposite of what Stephen had said in his article. Chuck talks with Stephen about that. Stephen comes back some minutes later admitting he has made a mistake: he saw so many spirits bottles thrown out of the place, that he took it for granted that they came from a room saloon. Stephen says he's sorry, and that if Chuck wants his resignation, he'll sign it right away. However, Chuck is not about to do anything of that sort, and the audience is left feeling that it was too much of a ruckus over the possible existence of a portable fridge or not.Stephen's girlfriend is Caitlin Avey (Chloë Sevigny), a fellow journalist at the newspaper. She is worried because Stephen has had much success lately, she's even a bit jealous. Stephen is freelancing and writing stories for other magazines, like Rolling Stones, because his news stories have always got an edge to them: he investigates, finds out the truth and talks about humourous situations and peculiar characters. Also, to Caitlin's dismay, he's even going to be busier, as he is about to start to study law, which he considers to be more prestigious.

Pyle, who represents America and its policies in Vietnam, is a CIA operative sent to steer the war according to Americas interests, and is passionately devoted to the ideas of York Harding, an American foreign policy theorist who said that what Vietnam needed was a third player to take the place of both the colonialists and the Vietnamese rebels and restore order. This third player was plainly meant to be America, and so Pyle sets about creating a Third Force against the Viet Minh by using a Vietnamese splinter group headed by corrupt militia leader General Thé (based on the actual Trinh Minh The). His arming of Thé's militia with American weaponry leads to a series of terrorist bombings in Saigon. These bombings, dishonestly blamed on the Communists in order to further American outrage, kill a number of innocent people, including women and children.Meanwhile, Pyle has stolen Fowlers Vietnamese mistress Phuong, promising her marriage and security. When Fowler finds out about Pyle's involvement in the bombings, he takes one definitive action to seal all of their fates. He indirectly agrees to let his assistant, Hinh, and his Communist cohorts confront Pyle; when Pyle tries to flee, Hinh fatally stabs him.

The story revolves around the love triangle that develops among a British journalist named Fowler, a young American CIA operative named Pyle, and a Vietnamese girl named Phuong. The storyline also emphasizes the growing American involvement and political turmoil that leads to the Vietnam War. Pyle represents America's interests in Vietnam and has been sent to the country to steer the war in America's favor, following the ideologies of foreign policy theorist York Harding. Pyle believes Vietnam needs a third player to take the place of the colonialists and the Vietnamese rebels to restore order – this third player being America. As a result, he creates a Third Force against the Viet Minh by using a Vietnamese splinter group led by corrupt militia leader General Thé. By arming General Thé's militia with American weaponry, a series of terrorist bombings is initiated in Saigon. These bombings are wrongfully blamed on the Communists to fuel American outrage, and they result in multiple civilian casualties, including women and children. In the midst of these events, Pyle steals Fowler's Vietnamese mistress, Phuong, by promising her a secure and married life. Upon discovering Pyle's involvement in the bombings, Fowler makes a decisive move that seals the fates of all three main characters. He indirectly allows his assistant, Hinh, and his Communist cohorts to confront Pyle. As Pyle tries to flee, Hinh fatally stabs him. Following the resolution of these events, Phuong returns to Fowler. Although the local French police commander suspects Fowler's involvement in Pyle's murder, he cannot gather any evidence to incriminate him, allowing Fowler to evade any possible consequences. In conclusion, Hinh, Fowler's assistant, is the one who stabs Pyle in the movie \\"The Quiet American.\\" The film portrays a love story intertwined with political events, which ultimately showcases the impact of American foreign policy and ideologies as a precursor to the Vietnam War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's impossible to say While the context provides information about Baby Bash's first major label studio album, Tha Smokin' Nephew, and its success, it does not provide any definitive evidence to support the hypothesis that Baby Bash will release an album that is more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew. The album's success, which includes making it to number 48 on the \\"Billboard\\" 200 and reaching RIAA Gold certification, is noteworthy; however, there are many factors that can influence the success of a future album release. For example, the music industry is constantly evolving, with changes in consumer preferences, distribution channels, and promotional strategies. These factors can impact an artist's ability to achieve commercial success with a subsequent album. Additionally, predicting the critical reception of an album is difficult, as music tastes differ widely among listeners and critics. Trends in musical genres also come and go, which can impact an artist's relevance and appeal to a broad audience. Furthermore, the level of success of Baby Bash's future albums may depend on the artist's ability to maintain or grow his fan base, as well as collaborating with other established musicians and producers in the industry. The specific timing of an album's release, its competition in the market, and its promotion can all play a role in determining its overall success. While it is possible that Baby Bash could release an album that exceeds the success of Tha Smokin' Nephew, based on the provided context, it is impossible to predict this outcome with certainty. Success in the music industry is dependent on a multitude of factors, many of which are outside an artist's control."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","completion":"The Baker Street Irregulars, a group of street-smart children, first appear in the Sherlock Holmes story titled \\"A Study in Scarlet,\\" written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and published in 1887. This is the very first story that introduces the world to the famous detective Sherlock Holmes and his dear friend Dr. John Watson. In \\"A Study in Scarlet,\\" Dr. John Watson is introduced to Sherlock Holmes, and the two quickly become flatmates at 221B Baker Street in London. The story then revolves around a murder mystery that Holmes is trying to solve. The Baker Street Irregulars are introduced as a group of teenage boys who are employed by Holmes, serving as a clandestine intelligence network on the streets of London. Sherlock Holmes refers to these young men as his \\"Baker Street division of the detective police force.\\" He values their ability to slip in and out of places unnoticed, gather information, and interact with the people who would otherwise be wary of adult investigators. Holmes often relies on their local knowledge, perception, and resourcefulness. Their leader, a young boy named Wiggins, is the principal contact between the Irregulars and Holmes. He is directly responsible for reporting any relevant information gathered by the group to the detective. In \\"A Study in Scarlet,\\" Wiggins helps Holmes by quickly bringing him information he needs to move forward with the investigation. The Baker Street Irregulars appear in other Sherlock Holmes stories as well, such as \\"The Sign of the Four\\" (1890) and \\"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\\" (1893). Though they only make a few appearances throughout the entire canon, their sharp eyes and ears significantly contribute to the resolution of the cases they are involved in. In conclusion, the Baker Street Irregulars make their first appearance in \\"A Study in Scarlet,\\" assisting Sherlock Holmes in solving the murder mystery that comprises the plot of the narrative. Their keen observational skills and ability to blend into the background of London's streets prove invaluable to the iconic detective, making them a fascinating and essential part of the Holmesian world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Over the course of the day, Campbell must find Sally, retrieve his wallet, and avoid the diabolical Skearns, who is looking for financial compensation after spending 15 years in prison for a crime committed by his twin brother. The film ends with Skearns driving off a cliff and into a canyon, rather than risk capture by the police. Marci, who tells her classmates what happened, introduces them to her brother and his wife, Sally. Marci also tells her classmates that the Jim brothers were congratulated as heroes for trying to bring a criminal to justice. Both were given jobs as FBI informants.

How is \\"Use: Instantly increases your rage by 20.\\" said in French?","completion":"To translate this phrase into French, I'll follow these steps: 1. Break down the sentence: The original English sentence is \\"Use: Instantly increases your rage by 20.\\" In this context, \\"use\\" is an instruction, \\"instantly increases your rage\\" is the action, and \\"by 20\\" is the extent of the action. 2. Translation: - \\"Use\\" translates as \\"Utilisation\\" in French. However, in most game contexts, a simple \\"Utilisez\\" (meaning \\"Use\\") could be more appropriate because it is an imperative verb form used for instructions. - \\"Instantly increases your rage\\" can be translated as \\"augmente instantanément votre rage\\". - \\"by 20\\" can be translated as \\"de 20\\". By putting those parts together, the French translation could be: \\"Utilisez : Augmente instantanément votre rage de 20\\". It's worth mentioning that the verbs and nouns may need to be adjusted depending on the game's context and intended audience. For instance, if \\"rage\\" is a specific term used in the game, it may be better to keep it untranslated. Also \\"Utilisez\\" could be replaced by \\"Usage\\" in some contexts.

A power of 2 is a number in the form '2^n', it is a number that is the result of multiplying by 2 n times. The following are all powers of 2, '2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096'. If an integer is exactly in equally far from two different powers of 2 then you should output the larger power of 2. The output should be a list of integers that is the result of rounding each integer int the input list to the closest power of 2. The output should include a '[' to denote the start of the output list and ']' to denote the end of the output list. Input: [71, 167, 2224, 4869, 18, 34, 4, 24, 302, 385, 2179] Output:","completion":"This task is asking you to take a list of integers as input and then round each integer to the closest power of 2. A power of 2 is a number like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on. In case an integer is equidistant from two different powers of 2, you should choose the larger power of 2. The result should be presented as a list of integers, enclosed by square brackets. Here's how to approach this task step-by-step: 1. Take the list of integers as input. For example, the given input is: [71, 167, 2224, 4869, 18, 34, 4, 24, 302, 385, 2179] 2. For each integer in the list, find the closest power of 2 by following these steps: a. Determine the lower and upper powers of 2 that the integer is between. For example, if the number is 71, the lower power of 2 it is closest to is 64 (2^6), and the upper power of 2 is 128 (2^7). b. Calculate the difference between the integer and both the lower and upper powers of 2. In this case, the difference between 71 and 64 is 7, and the difference between 71 and 128 is 57. c. Pick the power of 2 that has the smallest difference. If both differences are equal, choose the larger power of 2. In this case, the smallest difference is between 71 and 64, so 64 would be the rounded power of 2 for the number 71. 3. Repeat step 2 for each integer in the input list. 4. Collect the rounded powers of 2 as the output list. Continuing with our example, the output list would be: [64, 128, 2048, 4096, 16, 32, 4, 16, 256, 256, 2048] 5. Finally, add square brackets at the beginning and the end of the output list to denote the list format. So, the final output would look like this: [64, 128, 2048, 4096, 16, 32, 4, 16, 256, 256, 2048]"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

Another 16 French soldiers were injured, some seriously, in the incident in Kapisa province. An official told the BBC that an Afghan non-commissioned officer got into a \\"verbal clash\\" and opened fire. President Nicolas Sarkozy said France was suspending its training programmes in Afghanistan following the attack. He was sending his Defence Minister Gerard Longuet to the country immediately, he said. Analysis President Sarkozy used very tough language to condemn the attack. French soldiers, he said, were in Afghanistan to help their allies. \\"We cannot accept that a single one of our troops should be killed or wounded by those allies,\\" he said. The president said that Defence Minister Gerard Longuet will on his return from Afghanistan deliver a report on security conditions there for French troops. If these are not satisfactory, he said, then the question of an early withdrawal of French troops from Afghanistan will be on the table. Q&A: Foreign forces in Afghanistan Mr Sarkozy said that the question of an early French withdrawal from Afghanistan would arise if security conditions were not re-established. He said it was unacceptable for French troops to be fired on by their allies. A Taliban spokesman said it was not clear if the attacker was a member of their group but described him as a \\"conscientious Afghan soldier\\". 'Murdered' Thursday's incident, in the Tagab district, took place at 08:00 local time (03:30 GMT), according to French media reports. \\"We understand that during a fitness exercise some of our soldiers were suddenly attacked by an Afghan soldier, so they were unarmed,\\" French foreign ministry spokesman Bernard Valero told the BBC. \\"They were murdered. It was impossible for them, first of all, to know what was going to happen and secondly to react to this aggression,\\" he added. The attack brings to 82 the total number of French personnel killed in Afghanistan since 2001. An Afghan official told the BBC: \\"This is a tragic incident, a sad and tragic day for us and for Nato.\\" The Afghan soldier was arrested by the French, he said. Nato confirmed in a statement that four of its personnel had been killed, and that a suspect had been apprehended, but gave no further details. Afghan President Hamid Karzai released a statement conveying \\"his deepest condolences and sympathy to the French president, families of the victims and to the French people\\". The relationship between the two countries was \\"historic\\" and \\"honest,\\" and a source of happiness, he said. President Karzai is due to meet Mr Sarkozy in Paris next week. The BBC's Bilal Sarwary in Kabul says there has been an increasing number of incidents involving Afghan soldiers turning their weapons on Nato forces. The Afghan government has failed to come up with a solution or a strategy to prevent such attacks, he says. Recent Afghan 'turncoat' attacks 9 January 2012: US soldier killed by Afghan in army uniform 29 December 2011: Two French troops killed by Afghan soldier 29 October: Three Australian troops killed by man in Afghan army uniform 4 August: Nato soldier killed by Afghan in police uniform 16 July: Nato member killed by Afghan army soldier Anatomy of an Afghan 'turncoat' killer Three weeks ago two members of the French Foreign Legion were shot dead by an Afghan National Army soldier, also in Kapisa province. Five French soldiers were killed by a suicide bomb while on patrol in the Tagab district of Kapisa in July 2011. That was the heaviest loss of French life in Afghanistan since 10 soldiers were killed in a Taliban ambush in the Sarobi area, east of Kabul, in August 2008. 2011 was France's bloodiest year in Afghanistan with the loss of 26 personnel. The risks faced by French forces have increased as the areas of the country where they are stationed have become less stable. 'Difficult decision' French troops have been part of the Nato-led operation in Afghanistan since 2001, and the country currently has 3,600 troops there. President Sarkozy announced in July that 1,000 troops would be withdrawn from the country by the end of 2012, ahead of full Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014. Mr Sarkozy faces re-election this year and the loss of French life in Afghanistan is a highly politically sensitive issue in France. The socialist challenger for the presidency, Francois Hollande - who is ahead of Mr Sarkozy in opinion polls - has reiterated his position that he would withdraw French troops by the end of the year, if elected. A senior commander with the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) in Kabul said he was speechless at the prospect of a potential French withdrawal. France is one of the few members of Isaf to have more than 1,000 troops in Afghanistan. Commenting on the gun attack, Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said such incidents were relatively rare. \\"The reality is that every day, 130,000 Isaf troops from 50 nations fight and train with over 300,000 Afghan soldiers. That takes a lot of trust among a lot of soldiers,\\" he said. In a separate development, a Nato helicopter has crashed in southern Afghanistan killing six soldiers. The nationalities of those killed has not been disclosed but they are believed to be American. The Taliban said they killed the soldiers, but an Isaf spokesman said there was no enemy activity in the area at the time. ||||| An Afghan soldier shot and killed four French troops Friday in eastern Afghanistan and a helicopter crash killed six more NATO service members in the south, officials said, marking a particularly deadly 24 hours for coalition forces. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Friday that France is suspending its training programs for Afghan troops after the killings, which he announced in a speech after the U.S.-led coalition said an Afghan soldier shot and killed four NATO troops. Sarkozy said it was \\"unacceptable\\" that Afghan troops would attack French soldiers. He said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is heading to Afghanistan after the attack, which is among the most deadly for French forces in the 10 years they have been serving in the NATO-led international force in Afghanistan. NATO said in statements that the Afghan shooter had been apprehended, but it disclosed no details about the incident. Similar attacks have raised fears of increased Taliban infiltration of the Afghan police and army as NATO speeds up the training of the security forces. In some cases the attackers were Afghan soldiers who turned on NATO troops. Others involved insurgents dressed in Afghan uniforms. Earlier this month, a U.S. service member was killed when a man in an Afghan army uniform opened fire at a base in the south of the country. In one of the worst incidents, a veteran Afghan military pilot opened fire at Kabul airport on April 27, 2011, killing eight U.S. troops and an American civilian contractor. U.S. Army Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings Jr., a spokesman for the coalition, said Friday that cases where Afghan soldiers have wounded or killed coalition forces are isolated cases and do not occur on a routine basis. \\"We train and are partnered with Afghan personnel every day and we are not seeing any issues or concerns with our relationships,\\" he said. Late Thursday, a NATO helicopter crashed, killing six members of the international military force. The cause is still being investigated, but a coalition statement said there was no enemy activity in the area at the time of the crash. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef claimed insurgents shot down the helicopter, a Chinook, in Musa Qala district of Helmand province, killing all on board. The coalition did not disclose the nationalities of those killed and would not release details of the crash until the families of the dead were notified. It was the deadliest crash in Afghanistan since August, when 30 American troops died after a Chinook helicopter was apparently shot down in Wardak province in the center of the country. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"On January 20, 2012, four French soldiers were killed and 16 others injured in northern Afghanistan's Kapisa province after an Afghan National Army serviceman opened fire. Following this, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced the suspension of France's training programs for Afghan troops and sent Defence Minister Gerard Longuet to Afghanistan. Mr. Sarkozy also stated that early withdrawal of French troops from Afghanistan would become a consideration if security conditions did not improve. In total, 82 French personnel were killed in Afghanistan since 2001. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, as there is an increasing number of incidents of Afghan soldiers turning against NATO forces, raising concerns of Taliban infiltration into Afghan security forces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose person has a fever happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"A: Yes, the supposed perturbation (fever) has an effect on the body cooling process, both directly and indirectly. When a person has a fever, their body temperature rises, which is the initial step in the body cooling process. This elevated temperature triggers the brain to tell blood vessels to dilate. As a result, blood flow increases, helping to dissipate heat. The elevated body temperature also causes sweat glands to become more active, releasing moisture from the pores. This moisture then evaporates, leading to a cooling effect on the body. In this case, the fever acts as a direct catalyst for the body's cooling mechanisms, indirectly leading to more body cooling occurring in an attempt to bring the body temperature back to normal or reduce the fever."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Young was born in Compton, California, the first child of Theodore and Verna Young. His middle name, Romelle, is derived from his father's amateur R&B singing group, The Romells. His parents married in 1964, separated in 1968, and divorced in 1972. His mother later remarried and had three children: sons Jerome and Tyree (both deceased) and daughter Shameka. Dr. Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the Akai MPC3000, a drum machine and sampler, and that he often uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording. He cites 1970s funk musicians such as George Clinton, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as his primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo. In 2001 he told Time magazine, \\"I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better.\\" Other equipment he uses include the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland. Dr. Dre also stresses the importance of equalizing drums properly, telling Scratch magazine in 2004 that he \\"used the same drum sounds on a couple of different songs on one album before but you'd never be able to tell the difference because of the EQ.\\" Dr. Dre also uses the digital audio workstation Pro Tools and uses the software to combine hardware drum machines and vintage analog keyboards and synthesizers. After founding Aftermath Entertainment in 1996, Dr. Dre took on producer Mel-Man as a co-producer, and his music took on a more synthesizer-based sound, using fewer vocal samples (as he had used on \\"Lil' Ghetto Boy\\" and \\"Let Me Ride\\" on The Chronic, for example). Mel-Man has not shared co-production credits with Dr. Dre since approximately 2002, but fellow Aftermath producer Focus has credited Mel-Man as a key architect of the signature Aftermath sound. In 1999, Dr. Dre started working with Mike Elizondo, a bassist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has also produced, written and played on records for female singers such as Poe, Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette, In the past few years Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr. Dre's productions. Dr. Dre also told Scratch magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies. In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter Burt Bacharach by sending him hip hop beats to play over, and hopes to have an in-person collaboration with him in the future. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he use any other instruments?","completion":"Yes, Dr. Dre used other instruments.

Article: Since before 2000 BC, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops. The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The Rig Veda, which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control. By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables. Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. Paul Müller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide. Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by \\"triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate\\".

Figure out if something is occurring that you don’t know about. Help your child identify their feelings. Article:","completion":"Title: Identifying and Addressing Psychological Issues in Children: A Parent's Guide Introduction As parents, we are ultimately responsible for our children's well-being, both physically and emotionally. At times, understanding the true source of our child's discomfort or distress can be challenging. Psychological issues can manifest as behavioral or emotional symptoms that can be difficult to recognize and acknowledge. This article aims to provide guidance on determining if your child may be experiencing a psychological issue, and how to support and help them through the process. 1. Determine if your child has a psychological issue It's essential first to recognize that what may appear as disobedience or mood swings in children may sometimes be a sign of a deeper, underlying psychological issue. To determine if your child is experiencing psychological difficulties, it's crucial to remain observant and aware of any significant changes in their behavior, mood, or communication. If you notice symptoms such as excessive moodiness, irritability, lack of motivation, or withdrawal from social activities, it is wise to consider the possibility of a psychological issue. 2. Rule out any physical pain Before attributing a child's discomfort to psychological issues, it's necessary to rule out any physical sources of pain or discomfort. Consult with your pediatrician if you have concerns about your child's health, as they can assess for any medical conditions that may be causing distress. Persistent headaches, stomach aches, or any other unexplained physical discomfort should always be evaluated by a professional before assuming psychological factors are at play. 3. Investigate potential hidden factors If there is no identifiable physical source of discomfort, consider possible hidden factors that may be affecting your child. Bullying, academic struggles, pressures to meet expectations, or conflicts with friends can all contribute to psychological distress. Engaging in open, non-judgmental conversations with your child is essential to uncover any potential issues. Offering support and empathizing with their feelings will make them feel comfortable and well-equipped to share any struggles they may be experiencing. 4. Help your child identify their feelings Development of emotional intelligence is crucial for children's emotional well-being and ability to navigate the world effectively. Start by helping your child recognize, understand, and label the emotions they are experiencing. Encourage them to talk about their feelings and listen attentively without judgment or criticism. 5. Offer support and encourage professional help if needed It's essential for parents to provide emotional support and reassurance when their child is experiencing psychological distress. Keep in mind that it can also be beneficial to seek professional help from psychologists, psychiatrists, or counselors in more severe instances. They can provide insight, evaluation, and treatment options for various issues, including anxiety, depression, trauma, or other mental health disorders. In conclusion, recognizing psychological issues in children begins with staying attentive to changes in their behavior, emotions, and communication. Ruling out any physical pain or discomfort, investigating potential hidden factors, and helping your child identify and express their feelings is crucial in addressing and managing these issues. Parental support and empathy, along with seeking appropriate professional help when necessary, can significantly improve your child's mental and emotional well-being, ensuring they grow up to be happy, healthy, and emotionally resilient individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The validity of the second sentence doesn't directly depend on the first one. Both statements address different topics and do not have a cause-and-effect relationship. The first sentence is considering the analytical and comparative perspective of a case study. It's questioning whether the results from other relevant studies have been duly presented and reconciled with the case study findings. This type of question is asked typically in a research context, where studies or cases are compared against each other to recognize patterns, establish theories, or draw conclusions. On the other hand, the second sentence declares the impossibility of assessing results due to a catastrophic event: the \\"implosion of the Earth\\". This statement seems to be theoretical or hypothetical, as an actual implosion of Earth hasn't occurred. Such an event would indeed make impossible to assess anything, as it presupposes the end of all life and typical circumstances on the planet. However, the first sentence does not affect the second, or vice-versa. The comparison and reconciliation of study findings have no evident connection with a global catastrophe preventing assessment. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, it doesn’t necessarily make the second sentence true too, because their topics and contexts are not related.

Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who is evicting families? Movie plot title: Roger & Me Movie plot: Michael Moore is an eccentric, self-taught documentary film director who begins by introducing himself and his family through 8 mm archival home movies; in a voice-over, he describes himself as \\"kind of a strange child,\\" the Irish American Catholic middle-class son of a General Motors employee assembling AC Spark Plugs. Moore chronicles how GM had previously defined his childhood while growing up in Flint, Michigan, and how the company was the primary economic and social hub of the town. He points out that Flint is the place where the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike occurred, resulting in the birth of the United Auto Workers. He reveals that his heroes were the Flint natives who had escaped the life in GM's factories, including the members of Grand Funk Railroad, Casey Kasem, the spouses of Zubin Mehta (Nancy Kovack) and Don Knotts, and \\"Flint's most famous native son,\\" game show host Bob Eubanks.Initially, he achieves his dream of avoiding the dreary tradition of blue-collared factory life that lays for the majority of the population of Flint; by moving to California and working for a magazine in San Francisco, but this venture fails for him and he ultimately travels back to Flint. As he returns (in 1985), General Motors announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers, the jobs of whom will go to cheaper labor when the plant relocates to Mexico. GM makes this announcement even though the company is (according to Moore) experiencing record profits.Disguised as a TV journalist from Toledo, Ohio, Moore interviews some auto workers in Flint and discovers their strong antipathy to General Motors chairman Roger B. Smith. Moore begins seeking out Smith himself to confront him with an \\"up-close-and-personal\\" interview about the closing of the Flint auto factories. He tries to visit Smith at GM's headquarters in Detroit, yet he is blocked by building security guards as Moore hasn't made an appointment.

This decision leads to economic and social crises in Flint, Michigan, resulting in numerous families losing their jobs and being unable to sustain their livelihood, ultimately facing eviction from their homes. The actions of GM and the consequential widespread unemployment prompt Michael Moore to seek answers from Roger B.

If \\"The guy on a skateboard unbelievably jumps over a high barrier.\\", does it logically follow that \\"the guy is riding a bike.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"the guy is riding a bike\\" from the statement \\"The guy on a skateboard unbelievably jumps over a high barrier.\\" The original statement clearly describes the guy as being \\"on a skateboard\\". A skateboard and a bike are two different types of vehicles or modes of transportation. Skateboards are usually propelled by kicking one's foot against the ground while standing on the board, whereas a bike, short for bicycle, is a vehicle that has two wheels in line, powered by human effort via pedals. They are different in terms of structure, shape, number of wheels, method of propulsion, the way they are handled, and many other aspects. Because of these clear differences, one cannot assume interchangeability between these two objects based on the given sentence. Logically, if the subject was on a skateboard in the initial sentence, he could not have simultaneously been on a bike unless otherwise stated. Logic, by its nature, seeks consistency. In a similar fashion, the law of noncontradiction — a classic principle of logic — posits that two or more conflicting statements cannot all be true at the same time. Therefore, saying \\"the guy is riding a bike\\" directly after the initial statement contradicts the specified mode of transport (i.e., the skateboard). While it is plausible in a broader context that the guy might ride a bike at another moment, based on the information currently provided this conclusion cannot be drawn. Furthermore, any idea or conjecture about him being able to ride a bike would be speculative and could not be derived solely from the provided sentence. It would require additional information or context suggesting that the guy either has a bike or knows how to ride one. In conclusion, stating \\"the guy on a skateboard unbelievably jumps over a high barrier\\" does not provide any basis for logically inferring that \\"the guy is riding a bike.\\" They are different assertions involving two entirely different transportation methods with no given connection or transition from one to the other in the provided context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"How would Casey feel about what happened?\\", is \\"happy about the condition of her pool\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","completion":"No, \\"happy about the condition of her pool\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would Casey feel about what happened?\\". There are numerous reasons for this. Firstly, from the provided background, it is clear that Casey's pool was not maintained adequately each year, which has now led it to leak water. There's a sense of negligence towards the pool by either Casey or whoever was responsible for maintaining it, and this consequently caused the issue with the pool leakage. Given that the pool is leaking water due to poor maintenance, it is unlikely for Casey to be happy about the pool's condition. A leaking pool generally demands more consistent care and repair work, which can be quite frustrating and financially burdensome for the owner. It would be more reasonable to assume that Casey might feel concerned, disappointed, or even annoyed about the situation. Moreover, pools are often considered a valuable asset and a source of enjoyment for homeowners. A well-maintained pool can provide countless hours of relaxation, socializing, and exercise; therefore, a leaking pool would considerably diminish those benefits. This would naturally lead to negative emotions such as frustration or dissatisfaction, rather than happiness regarding the pool's state. In addition, a leaking pool also poses potential safety hazards and environmental concerns. The constant loss of water may lead to increased water bills and unnecessary wastage of resources. It may also weaken the structural foundation of the pool itself and the surrounding area, causing potential accidents. Therefore, it is implausible that Casey would associate happiness with these unfavorable outcomes. To sum up, while it's essential to acknowledge people's emotions can vary and that there may be outliers in any given situation, it does not make sense to argue that Casey would be \\"happy about the condition of her pool\\" in this case. Instead, it is far more likely that negative feelings, such as frustration, disappointment, or concern, would arise due to the repercussions of poor maintenance and unforeseen consequences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This House would decriminalise sadomasochism What is a possible side to this debate?","completion":"A possible side to this debate can be in favor of decriminalizing sadomasochism. For that, we need to analyze the reasons that support this standpoint, such as consent between involved parties, privacy rights, and the potential benefits of decriminalization. 1. Consent: Supporters of decriminalizing sadomasochism emphasize the importance of consent between all parties involved. Sadomasochism is a consensual practice between adults who have negotiated their boundaries, desires, and limits beforehand. Thus, decriminalizing such activities would rely on mutual consent, which negates the assumption of violence or abuse in the context of sadomasochism. 2. Private and consensual acts between adults: Decriminalizing sadomasochism would also respect the privacy rights of individuals and their ability to engage in consensual activities within the confines of their homes. The government or law should not interfere in personal lives, given that no harm is done to uninvolved individuals and the acts involved are private. 3. Education and safety awareness: Decriminalizing sadomasochism would allow professionals and educators to provide valuable information and resources for individuals interested in engaging in these consent-based relationships. Proper education can reduce the risks associated with such practices and promote a safer environment for participants. 4. Reduction in prejudice and discrimination: Sadomasochism has long been stigmatized and considered taboo in most societies. Decriminalizing it can help reduce prejudice and discrimination against those who engage in consensual sadomasochistic activities. It would provide a more inclusive and tolerant society, which recognizes and respects individual choices and preferences as long as consent is maintained. 5. Empowerment of individuals: Decriminalization would help empower individuals to explore their desires and fantasies within the realm of consent and safety. By removing the stigma, individuals who engage in sadomasochism would be able to enjoy their relationships without fear of judgement or legal repercussions. 6. Health and mental well-being: Studies have shown that individuals who engage in consensual BDSM activities (which include sadomasochism) report a high level of satisfaction with their practice and self-identify more positively compared to those who do not engage in such acts. Decriminalizing such practices may contribute to improved mental health and well-being by providing a safe space for individuals to explore their desires without fear of legal consequences. 7. Reduced pressure on the legal system: By decriminalizing sadomasochism, the legal system can focus on cases involving actual harm, violence, and non-consensual activities. This would allow law enforcement and courts to allocate their resources more efficiently while leaving consensual activities to be monitored and regulated by the participants themselves. In conclusion, decriminalizing sadomasochism can be seen as a way to respect individual rights to autonomy and privacy by allowing consensual activities to occur without interference. Advocates believe that this would promote consent-based relationships, enhance education and safety awareness, and reduce the stigma and discrimination against those who participate in such activities. Additionally, it would allow the legal system to focus on more pressing matters, while potentially improving the mental health and well-being of individuals who engage in consensual sadomasochistic relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body. Question: suppose drinking low acidic drinks like keifer happens, how will it affect stomach will process food efficiently. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"Drinking low acidic drinks like kefir will have minimal to no effect on the stomach's ability to process food efficiently. The stomach naturally secretes acid, primarily hydrochloric acid, which helps in breaking down and digesting food. When a low acidic drink like kefir is consumed, it does not significantly alter the acidic environment of the stomach. The stomach can still efficiently release an adequate amount of acid required for digestion, regardless of the low acidity from the kefir. Furthermore, kefir contains probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that promote gut health. These probiotics can support the digestive process and even contribute to better nutrient absorption, promoting overall gut health. Therefore, drinking kefir may have a positive effect on the stomach and digestion rather than hindering its efficiency. In summary, drinking low acidic drinks like kefir will have little to no effect on the stomach's ability to process food efficiently, and may even have some positive effects on digestion and gut health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As its title suggests, the Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sale at Sotheby’s Geneva is a treasure trove of gems and unique jewels that are a feast for the eyes. I have chosen a few highlights that represent the diversity of the sale and it will be interesting to see how each will perform. The Blue Moon diamondThis magnificent 12.03-carat Internally Flawless, Fancy Vivid Blue diamond, dubbed the Blue Moon, has gained a lot of attention. The cushion brilliant-cut diamond is an amazing, intense blue colour with no hint of grey which is normally the case with blue diamonds. After seeing the Blue Moon I visited the Smithsonian Natural History Museum where the most famous blue diamond in the world resides: the Hope blue diamond. Having made a mental note of the colour of the Blue Moon, I compared the two diamonds. Although they are very similar, the Hope has a much darker blue undertone while the Blue Moon is more vibrant with an even saturation. They can be seen as freaks of nature, created when boron is mixed with carbon during the gem’s formation deep within the earth’s crust. And contrary to what may be perceived, blue diamonds are extremely rare, as only 0.1 per cent of diamonds show any evidence of blue colour. The Hope crystal was discovered in January 2014 in the famous Cullinan Mine in South Africa now owned by Petra Diamonds, weighing 29.62 carats. It took over six months to cut and polish, a nerve-racking job as there is no room for error. So far the world record auction price for a diamond and any jewel is the Graff Pink, which sold for 46,158,674 in November 2010. The Blue Moon is being auctioned with a high estimate of 55 million, so this is a wonderful opportunity to watch the sale live on the Sotheby’s website and possibly witness history being made. Estimate 35-55 million The Queen Maria-José ruby ringRubies are the king of all coloured gemstones and good quality, unheated stones weighing over five carats that still shine brightly with an intensity of fire are extremely rare. When you pick up a ruby whose vibrancy of colour in incandescent light is like a red electric light bulb, you know that you are holding a true gem. However, any significant gemstone’s origin and authenticity has to be confirmed by an internationally-recognised gemmological laboratory report. This ruby, weighing 8.48 carats, is from the old ruby mines in Burma and as rubies have always represented passion it was a very fitting gift from Italian bibliophile Tammaro de Marinis on the occasion of Maria-José’s wedding to Crown Prince Umberto in 1930. Set in a charming gold and diamond ring mount, I am sure it will attract the attention of a future suitor. Estimate 6-9 million Jabot Pin by Cartier, circa 1920With the eagerly awaited exhibition Bejewelled Treasures: The Al Thani Collection opening at the Victoria & Albert Museum on November 21st, I could not resist picking out this jewel as it would be perfect to wear while visiting the exhibition. This jabot pin’s design has been inspired by the traditional Indian sarpech, a turban ornament. Europe was first introduced to Indian jewellery, with its brightly coloured enamels along with sumptuous pearls and diamonds, at the time of the Great Exhibition in London in 1851. Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India in 1876 and Indian jewellery then became in vogue, although it was the Exposition Universelle 1900 in Paris when Cartier created an “Indian” ring that paved the way for Indian-inspired jewels to become sought after by the ladies of high society Europe. Perhaps the V&A’s upcoming exhibition will spark a similar modern-day trend. Estimate 115,000-225,000 All items will be auctioned at the Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sale at Sotheby's Geneva on November 11 What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about a special event called the Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sale at Sotheby's Geneva.

Answer:","completion":"Given the question \\"What will happen to Tracy?\\" after she visits Kendall's place, despite Kendall expressing that he didn't want to be bothered, the answer \\"be welcomed by Kendall\\" could be considered valid but uncertain. Human behavior and emotions are complex, and understanding the context of their relationship and analyzing various possibilities is crucial to provide a comprehensive answer. There is a chance that Kendall could welcome Tracy despite his initial statement. It is essential to consider that people's moods and opinions can change, and Kendall might feel differently about Tracy's presence upon arrival. In this case, Kendall may appreciate that Tracy cared enough to visit him and chose to ignore his initial request. On the other hand, it is also possible that Kendall may not welcome Tracy, as he expressly communicated his desire to be left alone. In this situation, Kendall might feel that Tracy disrespected his boundaries, leading to potential conflict or tension in their relationship. Furthermore, other factors play a vital role in the outcome: the nature of their relationship, the reason behind Kendall's desire for solitude, and Tracy's intention for visiting him. Understanding these nuances will lead to a more accurate assessment of whether or not Tracy would be welcomed by Kendall. In conclusion, while it is possible for Tracy to be welcomed by Kendall, the answer is uncertain without sufficient contextual information. Human behavior is intricate, and predicting reactions requires a comprehensive understanding of their relationship, intentions, and emotions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It highlights the influence Egyptian writer Tawfiq al-Hakim's novel Return of the Spirit had on him, emphasizing the idea of a strong, representative leader. Nevertheless, the political theory that truly fascinated Nasser was Arab Socialism or Arab Nationalism combined with socialism. Nasser sought to unify the Arab world and promote social justice and economic development, principles that he believed could not be achieved without a solid socialist foundation. Nasser's Arab Socialism largely focused on the following key principles: 1. Arab Unity: Nasser sought to create a unified Arab state, transcending nationalist boundaries, and prioritizing the shared history, language, and culture of the Arab peoples. For him, the Arab world was not just a group of separate nations but a single entity, which needed to come together to fight against colonialism and imperialism. 2. Economic Development: Nasserism is based on socialist principles that promote social justice and equitable distribution of wealth. Nasser sought to nationalize key industries, especially the Suez Canal, as a means of securing financial independence from foreign powers and providing for social welfare programs to benefit all citizens. 3. Social Justice: The core philosophy of Nasser's Arab Socialism was uplifting the oppressed and marginalized communities. His policies aimed at reducing income inequality, providing better education and healthcare, redistributing land, and ensuring equal opportunities for all citizens. 4. Anti-Imperialism: One of the defining features of Nasserism was its staunch opposition to colonial and imperial powers. Nasser believed that the Arab world could only achieve true independence, growth, and prosperity by breaking free from the influence of imperialist nations. 5. Non-Alignment: In the context of the Cold War, Nasser followed a policy of nonalignment, aiming to create strong ties with both Eastern and Western blocs without getting involved in their rivalry. He believed that aligning with one side would jeopardize the objective of Arab unity and undermine efforts to resist external influences. While the influence of Tawfiq al-Hakim's novel Return of the Spirit is evident in Nasser's belief in a strong, representative leader, it is important to recognize that Nasser's fascination with political theory revolved around Arab Socialism. This ideological foundation ultimately played a significant role in shaping the policies pursued during his presidency and his broader vision for the Arab world."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Solve 0 = 120*r - 91*r - 174 for r.","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = 120*r - 91*r - 174 for r, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The equation contains two terms with the variable r: 120*r and -91*r. We need to combine them. 120*r - 91*r = (120 - 91) * r (120 - 91) * r = 29*r Now the equation looks like this: 0 = 29*r - 174 Step 2: Isolate the variable r. To isolate r, we want to get rid of the constant term -174. We can do this by adding 174 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 174 = 29*r - 174 + 174 This simplifies to: 174 = 29*r Step 3: Solve for r. Now that we have isolated the variable r, we can solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 29: 174 / 29 = 29*r / 29 This becomes: 6 = r Now we know that r = 6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. and the situation: Two groups of soldiers started different training programs. Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group. Answer the following question: Which group didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training? Answer:","completion":"The group that didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training was the Blue group, which primarily focused on weight training for three months. The Blue group, by engaging in weight lifting exercises, concentrated on building their skeletal muscles and increasing their size and strength. Weight training exercises involve the use of resistance to promote muscular contraction, which ultimately leads to the development of muscle mass and overall strength. During these exercises, the primary focus is on skeletal muscle contraction, and while the heart rate might increase due to the exertion, the primary impact is not on increasing the strength and efficiency of cardiac muscles. On the other hand, the Brown group, which ran 3 miles a day for three months, was primarily focused on exercises aimed at improving their cardiovascular fitness. Running is an aerobic exercise that involves the repeated and continuous contraction of the cardiac muscle, leading to a faster heart rate and an increased volume of blood being pumped by the heart. This type of exercise greatly contributes to the strengthening of the cardiac muscles, leading to enhanced heart functioning and overall cardiovascular health. In conclusion, the Blue group, which concentrated on weight training exercises, experienced less of an increase in their hearts pumping more blood compared to the Brown group, who engaged in daily running sessions meant to improve their cardiovascular fitness and the efficiency of their cardiac muscles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reuters - Wall Street investors will get theirfirst glimpses in September of how companies performed in thethird quarter, and financial experts say don't look for toomany positive earnings surprises. Which is the best summary of this article?","completion":"This article indicates that Wall Street investors are set to receive initial insights into companies' third-quarter performance in September. However, financial experts are suggesting that these disclosures may not carry many positive earnings surprises. The article does not provide specific details on why optimism is low, but such caution typically arises from factors such as economic trends, company indicators, or general market behavior. In stock market dynamics, earnings reports are valuable for investors as they can significantly influence stock prices - positive surprises typically boost share prices, while disappointing results can cause them to plummet. Hence, investors' anticipation is a reflection of their concern over the potential impact on their investment portfolios. Downsides are particularly worrying since they can initiate sell-offs, leading to broader market downturns. Investors, therefore, must brace themselves for any unexpected shocks and adopt appropriate strategies to safeguard their investments. Besides, they may also need to align their expectations to new realities, especially in volatile and uncertain times.

The film opens as a pregnant woman gives birth to a vampire. A young Brother, Silus, aged 10–13 is told this child, Edgar and he are from the same mother. Throughout this introduction, the mother is in visible emotional distress, reaching out across the room to Silus, trying to touch him. Captioned \\"100 Years Later.\\" Jamestown slum has had a series of attacks on women, who are all found with their throats bitten. Lilly Squires is in charge of the human police investigating these cases. She states that she comes from a workhouse in this same slum, and we establish that she is one of the few cops who care what happens to these people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap. Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus. Silus is detailed by the church cardinals to work with the human police, because the Brothers know that these attacks have been carried out by a Brother; Silus's brother Edgar. Edgar has sent Silus a recording of his last murder, challenging him to find and stop him before he kills again. Edgar provides the location of his next murder. With Silus' help, Lilly puts together a task force to stake out the area Edgar has targeted. However Edgar distracts the cops and attacks Lilly, biting her in the neck. An officer interrupts the attack and Edgar flees. To save Lilly's life, Silus tells her to drink his blood, which she does. Silus then pursues Edgar, managing to shoot him with a tranquilizing dart. Silus later visits Lilly in hospital. We establish that she has no family as they died from influenza. Lilly is having visions from drinking Silus' blood.

Focused on the story of Joshua \\"J\\" Cody, who is connected by blood to a notorious Melbourne crime family led by his estranged grandmother Janine 'Smurf' Cody, the film explores the relationships and loyalties within a family embroiled in a dangerous life of crime. The word \\"Underworld\\" is an appropriate choice for this title, as the characters in the film reside in a world where crime and violence are the norm. As J navigates this new life and comes to learn the roles of his family members, the title suggests a world that exists beneath the surface of everyday life, one ruled by dark and dangerous figures who go to great lengths to protect their kin. The term \\"Kin\\" highlights the strong family element in the film and allows the audience to quickly understand that this story is centered around a family dynamic. The 'J' character is forced into living with his estranged grandmother and three uncles who all partake in criminal activities. It emphasizes that these blood relationships will be at the core of the film's story, driving much of the action and character development. Lastly, \\"Ties That Bind\\" is a fitting subtitle for the movie, as the phrase refers to that which holds people together, often with a sense of obligation or duty. In this case, the ties that bind the main character, J, to his unconventional family may be that of blood, shared history, and the secrets they hold together - including the acts of violence, criminality, and betrayal that occur throughout the story.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to who gave famous state subject law to the state of j&k??","completion":"The famous state subject law in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) was given by Maharaja Hari Singh, the last ruling Maharaja of the princely state of J&K, in 1927. The law, also known as the Jammu and Kashmir State Subject Law, was initially introduced as the Notification No. 1-L/84. Maharaja Hari Singh ascended to the throne in 1925 and, during his reign, he faced several challenges, including social, economic, and political issues. One of the key concerns was the protection of the rights and privileges of the indigenous people of Jammu and Kashmir, particularly regarding land ownership, employment, and political participation. The primary motive behind the introduction of the state subject law was to shield the state's residents from the influx of outsiders who sought to exploit the state's resources and opportunities. This law defined specific criteria to categorize individuals as \\"state subjects,\\" which are as follows: 1. Class I: Individuals born or settled in the state before March 31, 1887, and their descendants. 2. Class II: Individuals who settled in the state between March 31, 1887, and March 16, 1920, and held immovable property. 3. Class III: Individuals who have settled in the state after acquiring immovable property under a valid grant or title before March 16, 1920. 4. Class IV: Individuals who have permanently settled in the state after March 16, 1920, on a valid permit issued by the government and continuously residing in the state for a period of not less than ten years. Those categorized as state subjects were granted specific privileges and rights, including: 1. Acquiring immovable property 2. Obtaining government employment 3. Participating in state legislative assemblies and local bodies 4. Access to state scholarships, grants, and aids In 1947, after India gained independence and the partition of India and Pakistan took place, Maharaja Hari Singh decided to accede the state of J&K to the Dominion of India, signing the Instrument of Accession on October 26, 1947. The state subject law continued to exist within the newly formed Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, with certain modifications over time, such as the replacement of the term \\"state subjects\\" with \\"permanent residents.\\" The state subject law, in the context of the larger political framework of Jammu and Kashmir, was altered on August 5, 2019, when the Government of India abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special autonomy and self-governance rights to the state. Alongside the abrogation, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act was passed, which bifurcated the state into two union territories—Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. This change effectively revoked the state subject law, transitioning the region's legal and administrative framework to match the rest of the country's constitutional provisions, effectively bringing about significant changes in property rights, employment, and political participation in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnnie had a set of small volumes of English verse, extensively annotated by his own hand, which Stoddard had brought to her early in their acquaintance, leaving it with her more as a gift than as a loan. She kept these little books after all the others had gone back. She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts. It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it. She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins. She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back. Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. Question: \\"What was the result of following terrorist money flowing from point A to point B?\\" Answer: \\"CIA found it was hard to attack funds of Al Qaeda\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. The CIA found it difficult to attack the funds of the clandestine organization Al Qaeda by simply following the money from point A to point B.

She rose to fame in 2002 after winning the inaugural season of the television series American Idol, which earned her a record deal with RCA Records. Clarkson's debut single, \\"A Moment Like This\\", topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became the best-selling single of 2002 in the US. It was followed by the release of her debut studio album, Thankful (2003), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Clarkson has scored 100 number ones on the Billboard charts and sold over 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide, including 14 million albums and 35 million digital singles in the United States alone. She became the first artist to top each of Billboard's pop, adult contemporary, adult pop, country and dance charts. She was ranked nineteenth on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Women in Music. Television channel Fuse included Clarkson among \\"30 Greatest Musicians to Come From Singing Competitions\\" list. Music executive Simon Cowell believed that \\"What [Clarkson] sold in the UK, Europe, Asia had nothing to do with American Idol. It had everything to do with the fact that she made a great record and she's got an incredible voice. She's not a girl who got lucky in a talent competition; we got lucky to find her.\\" According to The Hollywood Reporter, Clarkson is \\"the embodiment of the perfect pop star. Her unmistakable pipes are a powerful presence in top 40 and country, with forays into anthemic rock and dance.\\" Nolan Feeney from Time magazine asserted that Clarkson \\"has had more of a lasting impact on the pop music landscape than casual listeners might realize.\\" According to Billboard, Clarkson was a \\"phenomenon\\" who \\"helped legitimize\\" the impact of talent shows. The Washington Post wrote that \\"Clarkson's powerhouse voice and dynamic presence signaled that the music industry should take these reality show contestants seriously: Her first two albums, Thankful and Breakway, sold about 10 million copies combined, and her pop tunes became empowerment anthems across the globe.\\" Glenn Gamboa of Newsday believed that Clarkson \\"has set the standard for all singing competition contestants with her savvy mix of pop, rock and country.\\" Fox Broadcasting Company claimed that Clarkson gave \\"lasting credibility\\" to American Idol and \\"in so many ways she cleared a road\\" for all of the next contestants.\\" George Varga from The San Diego Union-Tribune underlined the difference of Clarkson from most of other talent show contestants is that she \\"writes or co-writes a fair number of [her] own songs. She is also the only one whose quest to follow her artistic instincts--the better to rock out and break free from the Idol cookie-cutter pop mold--prompted her to fire her management team and engage in a prolonged public battle with her record company, RCA.\\" Jon Lisi from PopMatters cited Clarkson as one of the forces of female domination in pop music of the 2000s. He explained that \\"Clarkson's anti-sexual image appealed to those who were uncomfortable with Britney Spears' overt exhibitionism. When Clarkson performed \\"Since U Been Gone\\" at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, for instance, she only showed her midriff, and it was clear that she was marketing herself to an alternative group of young females that liked pop music's conventional sound but didn't want to be confronted with sexual imagery.\\" Singer Demi Lovato, who cited Clarkson as her musical inspiration, said that \\"[Clarkson] stays out of the tabloids.

Here is a news article: Megyn Kelly takes issue with 'NYT' book review CLOSE Days after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, the New York Times has released a review of Megyn Kelly's forthcoming memoir, Settle for More. USA TODAY The New York Times published a review of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's memoir, Settle for More, after obtaining an early copy of the book scheduled to be published on Nov. 15. Kelly disputes The Times' characterization of two sections of her book; one which implies she said someone leaked Trump her first question in the first primary debate; and another that implies she thought she may have been poisoned the morning of the same debate. Kelly writes that Trump was livid the day before the first debate of the Republican primary campaign after he heard that Kelly's planned first question \\"was a very pointed question directed at him,\\" The Times reports. \\"This disconcerted her, because it was true: It was about his history of using disparaging language about women,\\" The Times wrote. While she doesn't delve into who might have leaked the question, the book gives the clear impression that former Fox New CEO Roger Ailes and others within the network \\"seemed to be nakedly colluding with the Republican presidential nominee,\\" according to The Times. Kelly went on Twitter late Thursday to shoot down the inference that the question was leaked. For the record, my book \\"Settle for More\\" does not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did. — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 11, 2016 Kelly also wrote that on the day of the debate, what The Times describes as an \\"overzealous, suspiciously enthusiastic driver\\" drove her to the event and insisted on making her coffee. She writes that she drank it and then was violently ill within 15 minutes, according to The Times. \\"Ms. Kelly never says outright that someone tried to poison her,\\" The Times reported. (A stomach bug was going around, she notes.) But the episode spooked her enough that she shared it later with Roger Ailes and a lawyer friend of his. Foul play? Again: She reports. You decide.\\" Again, Kelly took to Twitter to clarify her position. \\"Also for the record, I believe the reason I got sick the day of the debate was I contracted a stomach virus, just as Rand Paul did,\\" she wrote at midnight Thursday. Also for the record, I believe the reason I got sick the day of the first debate was I contracted a stomach virus, just as Rand Paul did. — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 11, 2016 There is one passage of The Times report Kelly has not yet disputed. Before the debate, Kelly did a piece on her show The Kelly File about Trump that the businessman did not like. According to Kelly, Trump refused to make a scheduled appearance on her show unless she called him, The Times reports. “I almost unleashed my beautiful Twitter account against you,” she says Trump told her, according to The Times, \\"and I still may.\\" Trump followed through with his threat after the debate, repeatedly insulting her with terms such as \\"bimbo\\" and \\"lightweight reporter.\\" He also implied her question at the debate was somehow tied to menstruation. \\"You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever,\\" he said in a CNN interview with Don Lemon. A report last week from Radar Online, which also says it obtained a copy of the book, detailed Kelly's allegations of sexual harassment against Ailes.

What are some powerful leaks WikiLeaks published about India?","completion":"Although the two questions appear similar, they have subtle differences in their focus and context. Let's first understand the meaning and intention behind each question before delving into a comprehensive response. 1. What are some of the popular WikiLeaks about India? This question seeks to know the popular or widely-discussed WikiLeaks releases that are specifically related to India. \\"Popular\\" implies that the leaks gained significant media attention, public interest, or had considerable impact on India and its people in general. Popular leaks might not necessarily be limited to issues of power or politics but could encompass various aspects of Indian society. 2. What are some powerful leaks WikiLeaks published about India? This question, on the other hand, focuses on the impactful or influential WikiLeaks releases pertaining to India. \\"Powerful\\" denotes that these leaks have had significant or far-reaching consequences on Indian politics, government, or the nation's image. The focus here lies mainly on the gravity and magnitude of the leaks rather than their popularity quotient. While there might be an overlap between the popular and powerful leaks, the differentiating factor is the emphasis on the impact and significant consequences in the latter. Now that we have distinguished the two questions let's discuss both popular and powerful WikiLeaks releases concerning India. Popular WikiLeaks about India: 1. Indian Swiss Bank Account Holders: WikiLeaks disclosed a list of Indians holding Swiss bank accounts, which fueled a massive debate on black money and corruption in India. The list exposed politicians, businessmen, and others allegedly involved in stashing unaccounted money in Swiss banks. 2. Radia Tapes: The Radia Tapes exposed the close nexus between powerful Indian journalists, politicians, and corporate lobbyists. These tapes contained recorded telephone conversations between the lobbyist Niira Radia and various influential individuals, revealing corruption and manipulation in Indian media and politics. Powerful leaks WikiLeaks published about India: 1. US Diplomatic cables on India: A series of diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks shed light on the American perspective of Indian politics, government, policies, and internal matters. These cables revealed sensitive information on India’s diplomatic relations, domestic politics, and military strategy, impacting India’s international standing and exposing the private opinions of Indian politicians. 2. Cash-for-votes Scandal: The WikiLeaks cables reported the alleged bribery that took place during a no-confidence motion against the Indian government in 2008. The cables exposed a conversation between a US political counselor and an Indian politician, stating that 4 opposition MPs were offered cash to save the government. This further amplified concerns regarding political corruption in India. While there is an overlap between popular and powerful leaks in this case, it is essential to note that the emphasis for popular leaks centers on capturing public interest in a broad sense, while powerful leaks stress the consequences and impact on India's politics, governance, and national image."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He spent more than 21 straight hours railing against any government funding for Obamacare. Then Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas joined the other 99 senators from both parties in voting Wednesday to move ahead on a spending plan expected to do just that. The rare 100-0 vote on a procedural step means the spending measure that would avoid a partial government shutdown next week now can be amended by Senate Democrats to restore funding for President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms, which had been eliminated last week by House Republicans. Cruz led a group of tea party conservatives in trying to block Senate consideration of the spending legislation because Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid made clear his caucus would remove the provision that defunded Obamacare.

Despite his seemingly futile efforts, Senator Ted Cruz remained undeterred in his passionate opposition to Obamacare. The Texas Republican's actions led to serious criticism and questioning of his political strategy. Critics argued that attempting to stop Obamacare through government funding measures was politically suicidal for Cruz, as the Democrats maintained control of the Senate, and President Barack Obama himself had a vested interest in preserving his flagship healthcare reform. As the weeks went on, the Senate Democrats indeed worked to restore the funding stripped away by the House Republicans, largely thanks to Majority Leader Harry Reid's leadership. Reid dismissed Cruz's tactics as more of a political stunt than a genuine attempt to enact change. This view was similarly echoed by some members within Cruz's party, leading to divisions and debate on their approach to healthcare reform. Throughout the country, differing views on Obamacare led to heated discussions among citizens. The partisan divide grew deeper, with supporters of the healthcare law praising its provisions and accessibility, while detractors cited its high costs, bureaucracy, and negative impact on businesses and employment. The national conversation on healthcare reform became more polarized than ever, with each side attempting to present their views as the most sensible and beneficial for the American people. In the end, despite the fierce opposition by Senator Cruz and his conservative allies, they were unable to change the trajectory of Obamacare due to the political reality of the Democratic-controlled Senate and Obama's unwavering dedication to his healthcare program. The effort by Cruz eventually came to be seen as politically damaging, not only to his own standing but also to the Republican party as a whole. Cruz's critics rejoiced in the inability of the Texas Senator to change the course of the ACA. However, the passionate debates and the determination of Cruz and his fellow conservatives planted seeds of doubt and controversy surrounding the Affordable Care Act that would linger for years to come, fueling future legislative attempts and reform discussions. Their tireless battle against Obamacare served as a constant reminder of the deeply ingrained political divide within the United States, and the seemingly unending struggle to find a common ground on the future of American healthcare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is highly negative. The reviewer is expressing a strong sense of dissatisfaction and disappointment with the film. This is evident from the outright statement in the initial sentence, \\"I'm sorry but this is just awful\\". The criticism is founded on several aspects, but primarily the acting and writing in the film. The reviewer mentions \\"bad acting\\" as one of the fundamental issues with the film, which indicates their displeasure with the performances. They also underscore their incredulousness as they recount sharing about the film with others who almost don't believe the extent of the criticized acting. This emphasizes their negative sentiment and an underlying sense of disappointment. The dialogue used in the film is another significant factor contributing to the reviewer's negative sentiment. They provide an example dialogue, \\"Hey my watch has stopped\\", presumably used recurrently in the film. Their annoyance with the dialogues' repetitiveness is expressed through the remark, \\"Imagine lines like that being repeated 15+ times before they say anything else\\". They disapprove of the inability of the film to deliver on its interesting premise. The concept of modern Japanese troops traveling back in time to the days of Busido warriors is seen as a great idea but the execution is viewed as disappointing, as can be inferred from \\"There is nothing wrong with the idea... with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything.\\" Lastly, the phrase \\"you have the movie's lack of greatness in a nutshell,\\" clearly summarizes their overall negative sentiment about the film. They convey their disappointment with how the film, despite a promising premise, failed to deliver greatness due to issues with the acting and dialogue. To conclude, observing the language and tone used in the review, from this analysis, it can be stated that the overall sentiment of the review is strongly negative."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In this, Noah Nichols (Darryl Stephens) and his ARC: Alex Kirby (Rodney Chester), Ricky Davis (Christian Vincent), and Chance Counter (Douglas Spearman), retreat to Marthas Vineyard for Noahs intimate marriage to Wade Robinson (Jensen Atwood). While Alexs hubby, Trey (Gregory Kieth), video chats from home to babysit their newly adopted Ethiopian child, Chance brings his husband, Eddie (Jonathan Julian), and Ricky is accompanied by the 19-year old Brandon (Gary Leroi Gray) for some lighthearted fling-dating. But as the four couples hole up and attend separate bachelor parties, each relationship begins to unravel. Alexs pill-popping throughout the weekend, compiled with surprise drop-ins from Noahs boss, Brandy (Jennia Fredrique) and rapper Baby Gat (Jason Steed), dont help Noah and Wade work through last-minute jitters.

Write an article with the title: \\"State funeral held for Poland's first post-communist prime minister\\"","completion":"Title: State Funeral Held for Poland's First Post-Communist Prime Minister On a somber day in Polish history, thousands of people gathered in the heart of Warsaw to pay their respects to the man instrumental in shaping Poland's transition from communism to democracy: Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the nation's first post-communist prime minister. Dignitaries, politicians, and citizens braved the chilly weather, united in their grief and appreciation for the man who led the nation through a tumultuous period. Born in 1927, Tadeusz Mazowiecki was a revered figure who had devoted his life to the cause of democracy and human rights. Initially a lawyer and journalist, Mazowiecki became a prominent political activist in the 1970s and founding member of Solidarity, the trade union that played a crucial role in the eventual collapse of communism in Poland. In 1989, after decades-long struggle between the communist regime and the pro-democracy opposition, Tadeusz Mazowiecki was chosen as the first non-communist prime minister since the end of World War II. Serving with steadfast dedication, he guided the country from a failing centrally-planned economy to a market-driven one, laying the foundations of modern Poland as we know it today. At the beginning of the state funeral, held in the historic St. John's Archcathedral, Archbishop of Warsaw, Kazimierz Nycz, delivered an emotional homily, highlighting Mazowiecki's unwavering commitment to democracy, social justice, and reconciliation. \\"Tadeusz Mazowiecki, our prime minister, and our compatriot, was subjected to great trials but never lost hope,\\" Archbishop Nycz said. \\"His entire life was a struggle for a just and free Poland, a struggle against hatred and discrimination.\\" The funeral was attended by numerous political leaders and European dignitaries, including Poland's President Andrzej Duda, Prime Minister Beata Szydło, and former presidents Lech Wałęsa and Bronisław Komorowski. Representatives from across the European Union and beyond had come to celebrate Mazowiecki's legacy of unwavering commitment to democracy and human rights. During the ceremony, words of remembrance were shared by members of Mazowiecki's family and friends. As President Duda offered his eulogy, he underscored the prime minister's pivotal role in shaping the nation: \\"It is not an overstatement to say that without Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the map of Europe would look very different today. He was instrumental in bringing the Iron Curtain down and setting Poland on the path of democracy and freedom.\\" The procession continued from St. John's Archcathedral to the historic Powązki Cemetery, where Mazowiecki was laid to rest among Poland's revered national heroes. The mournful tunes of military trumpets accompanied the procession, and streets were lined with citizens offering flowers and weeping as the hearse passed by. The state funeral of Tadeusz Mazowiecki not only served as a heartfelt tribute to Poland's first post-communist prime minister but also as a solemn reminder of how far the country has come in the last three decades. As Poland and many other former communist nations continue to grapple with the challenges and opportunities of democracy, Mazowiecki's life and political achievements stand out as a beacon of hope and an enduring symbol of resilience. The legacy of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki shall be remembered and cherished by generations to come, as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, one man's unwavering conviction in the cause of justice, freedom, and democracy can make a significant impact on the course of a nation's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If animals may compete for territory, water, food, or partners, then animals can compete for territory, water, food, or what? Answer choices: - environment - bosses - transportation - vegetation - plants - Energy. - partners - energy","completion":"Animals can indeed compete for territory, water, food, and partners, as these resources play a vital role in their survival, reproduction, and success. When we look at the other answer choices suggested, some are directly related to the resources mentioned, and others are not necessarily relevant for animals in their natural habitat. We can discuss these choices one by one: 1. Environment: The environment encompasses the surrounding conditions in which an animal lives and interacts. While animals do not directly compete for the environment, they can compete for territories that may have specific environmental features, like a water source or ideal nesting site. So, the competition for territory indirectly influences the animals' environment. 2. Bosses: This term is not relevant in the context of animals since it's generally associated with a human connection, like the working environment and hierarchy within an organization. 3. Transportation: Although transportation is useful to humans, it's not a resource that animals actively compete for within their natural habitat. Animals inherently have their transportation methods like walking, running, swimming, or flying. However, those mechanisms don't result in direct competition. 4. Vegetation: Vegetation serves as a source of food for herbivorous and omnivorous animals. This choice is closely related to the competition animals have over food resources, especially for species that rely on plant matter for their diet. 5. Plants: Similar to vegetation, plants are often food sources for animals. Competing for plants can be considered another aspect of animals competing for food resources. 6. Energy: Energy, in this context, might refer directly to the determination or strength animals devote to competing. While animals do not directly compete for energy, they allocate their energy in different ways through competition for territory, water, food, or partners. Alternatively, energy can be interpreted as feeding on a prey for a predator, thus implying food competition. 7. Partners: This choice is inherently included in the list of resources animals can compete for. Partners are essential for mating and reproducing, ensuring the survival and success of a species. 8. Energy (as it repeats in the list): Depending on its interpretation, it could mean animals competing for food resources or allocating their energy in various ways throughout competitions for the other resources mentioned. In conclusion, while some of the options listed, like vegetation and plants, can be related to the resources animals may compete for, other choices like bosses and transportation are not directly related. Thus, animals can compete for territory, water, food, partners, vegetation, and plants. These competitions revolve around resources that help animals survive and thrive, ensuring the continuation of their species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4. The \\"four-minute barrier\\" has since been broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners. In the last 50 years the mile record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds. Running a mile in four minutes translates to a speed of 15 miles per hour (24.14 km/h, or 2:29.13 per kilometre, or 14.91 seconds per 100 metres). - The marathon is a long-distance running event with an official distance of 42.195 kilometres (26.219 miles, or 26 miles 385 yards), usually run as a road race. The event was instituted in commemoration of the fabled run of the Greek soldier Pheidippides (more correctly, Philippides), a messenger from the Battle of Marathon to Athens, who reported the victory. - A world record is usually the best global performance ever recorded and officially verified in a specific skill or sport.

The event is part of the athletics programme at the Olympic Games and the World Championships in Athletics and is common at championship level events. The race consists of 25 laps around an Olympic-sized track. It is less commonly held at track and field meetings, due to its duration. The 10,000 metres track race is usually distinguished from its road running counterpart, the 10K run, by its reference to the distance in metres rather than kilometres. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe.

Context: Egypt, Syria and the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, signed the Damascus Declaration after the 1991 Gulf War to create a mechanism aimed at guaranteeing security in the Gulf region. Hypothesis: this treaty is impactful","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the context In the given context, we see that Egypt, Syria, and the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council signed the Damascus Declaration following the 1991 Gulf War. The purpose of this agreement was to establish a mechanism to guarantee security in the Gulf region. Step 2: Identify the key elements Key elements in this context are the countries involved (Egypt, Syria, and the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council), the timing (after the 1991 Gulf War), and the intention (to create a mechanism aimed at guaranteeing security in the Gulf region). Step 3: Understanding the hypothesis The hypothesis being proposed is that the treaty formed by the Damascus Declaration is impactful. To assess this hypothesis, we need to consider the components of the context and their relevance to the hypothesis. Step 4: Evaluate the hypothesis in regards to the context For the hypothesis to be correct, the Damascus Declaration needs to have a significant impact in terms of ensuring security in the Gulf region. Since the context states that the declaration was created to guarantee security in the region, it seems plausible that the treaty might have had an effect in achieving that goal. Step 5: Consider potential counterarguments and limitations While the intent of the Damascus Declaration was to guarantee security in the Gulf region, the context does not provide information on the effectiveness or implementation of the treaty. The success and impact of this treaty could be dependent on several factors that were not mentioned in the context, such as the cooperation of all signatories, the mechanisms put in place, and how strictly those mechanisms were followed. Conclusion: Based on the context provided, we can tentatively draw the hypothesis that the Damascus Declaration treaty may have had an impact on security in the Gulf region. Although the context implies that the treaty aimed to guarantee security, it does not provide enough information about the specific mechanisms or the degree of success achieved with the declaration. Therefore, our hypothesis is only supported to a limited extent, and further information would be needed to strengthen the assertion that the Damascus Declaration treaty has been truly impactful."},{"prompt":"Q:Given the below context: Despite Anthony Field's expressed dislike of the term, preferring to refer to it as \\"preserving the good name of The Wiggles\\", the group has stressed the importance of their brand and were protective of it. They remained as independent as possible, and retained full creative control and ownership of every aspect of their business. As Field stated, The Wiggles Pty Ltd was \\"not your regular 'corporate culture'\\". They made decisions by consensus and made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education. They made careful decisions regarding their endorsements of toys and other products, and avoided over-extending their brand by only licensing products that correlated with their image. They had high expectations regarding the behaviour and attitude of everyone associated with the group.The Wiggles became formally consolidated in 2005. The group's board of directors consisted of the original three members, Paul Field, who has been general manager of operations since the group was formed and their manager since the mid-1990s, and Mike Conway, who had worked for Ernst & Young in England and become their general manager in 2001.

Write an article based on this \\"Leigh Griffiths says Scotland should be savouring a first win over England since 1999, rather than rueing a 2-2 World Cup qualifying draw.\\"","completion":"Title: Scotland's Impressive Draw against England: A Silver Lining Worth Celebrating Step 1: Introduction Begin the article with the main quote and some background information on the match and history between the teams. In recent comments, Leigh Griffiths emphasized the positive side of Scotland's 2-2 World Cup qualifying draw with England, claiming it should be savoured as their first victory over their neighbouring rivals since 1999. While disappointment might linger for some fans, the spirit and intensity displayed by the players on the pitch should be considered as a moral victory for the Scottish team and highlights their growth in international football. Step 2: Discuss the match Recap the significant moments of the match, highlighting Scotland's resilience and performance. The match, which took place in June 2017, was a pulsating encounter and saw an impressive display from the Scottish team. The game featured both sides fighting tooth and nail, with goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and two superb free-kicks from Leigh Griffiths that put Scotland ahead. However, a last-minute equaliser from Harry Kane stole the victory from Scotland's grasp and resulted in a draw. Despite not securing a win, Scotland's overall performance showcased their improvement and newfound determination, particularly in key moments during the game. The energy and verve of the players were evident as they managed to surprise many by matching their more illustrious opponents' skill and determination. Step3: Analyse Griffiths' perspective Discuss Griffiths' point of view and how he views the result as a positive outcome. Leigh Griffiths, who scored both of Scotland's brilliant goals, sees the result as a signal of progress for the team. Instead of dwelling on the disappointment of a draw, he focuses on the fact that Scotland pushed a highly-rated English team to their limits and, in many respects, outplayed them in crucial moments. It is fair to view this as Scotland's first victory against England since 1999, mainly because it highlights the team's growth and potential to compete with the top teams in European football. Step 4: Address the broader implications of the result Discuss what the draw means for Scottish football and highlight its significance in the context of their World Cup qualifying campaign. The draw can also be perceived as a stepping stone for Scotland's campaign in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. While the final point tally wasn't enough for qualification into the tournament, this result against England demonstrated the team's capability to challenge the top sides. For the Scottish side, this performance might be the much-needed confidence boost that encourages them to aim higher and work persistently to ultimately succeed in future competitions. Step 5: Conclusion Sum up the main points of the article and reiterate the importance of focusing on the positives of the performance. In conclusion, while a 2-2 draw against England might not seem like an outright victory, it is a result that merits appreciation and recognition. Leigh Griffiths' outlook encourages fans and players alike to focus on the positives, such as the impressive performance and tenacity displayed by the Scottish team during the match, and use this as fuel for further growth and progress in international football. Ultimately, this draw against England should be cherished as a marker of Scotland's potential and a testament to their ability to contend with the top teams in Europe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of r, which is -20. 180 / (-20) = (-20 * r) / (-20) Step 3: Solve for r Perform the division in the equation and simplify. -9 = r So, the solution to the given equation 180 = -146*r + 126*r is r = -9."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, a study has found that while this is certainly true, men also have to deal with the fact that they are also more stupid than the fairer sex. In the study, scientists measured the IQ of 2500 brothers and sisters and they found an uneven number of men not only in the top two percent, but also in the bottom two percent. The study's participants were tested on science, maths, English and mechanical abilities. Though there were twice as many men as women in the smartest group, there were also twice as many men among the bottom. The aggregate scores of men and women were similar. One of the study's authors, psychology professor Timothy Bates, said that the phenomenon may be because men have always been expected to be high achievers and women have been restricted to spend more time taking care of their homes. \\"The female developmental program may be tilted more towards ensuring survival and the safety of the middle ground.,\\" the Daily Mail quoted Professor Bates, of Edinburgh University, as saying. The research _ past results that men were more likely than women to receive first class University degrees or thirds and women secured the seconds. It has been said that men are more ready to take risk when it comes to academics. Women have always found to be steadier in their learning. A past study has shown that women are securing more firsts and seconds, while men are continuing to receive more thirds. The argument for the change is that the increase of coursework at the cost of exams favors women's steady approach.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Obama Taps Geithner to Head Treasury, Prepares Economic Team for Roll-Out Next Week From Jake Tapper and George Stephanopoulos: After a very fluid process in which the identity of President-elect Obama’s leading candidate for the job seemed to fluctuate like the market, on Friday New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner emerged poised to become the next Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Obama intends to announce his nomination early next week. As one of the government’s point people dealing with Wall Street, Geithner has earned much respect from politicians and CEOs alike. He has been working closely with the current Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. As evidence of Geithner’s popularity on Wall Street, when the news leaked to two prominent business media — CNBC and the Wall Street Journal — the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared almost 500 points. Geithner, a registered independent, has long been respected in Obamaland, referred to as \\"Obama-esque\\" for his outside-the-box thinking, relative youth, his overseas upbringing (elementary school in New Delhi, high school in Bangkok) and his love of a good game of pickup basketball. The only other serious candidate for the Treasury slot has been the man who served that role at the end of the Clinton administration, Larry Summers. The formidable Summers is a man of great intellect but also controversy — he was forced out as president of Harvard for any number of perceived slights, including suggesting that females are innately inferior in engineering and math. Obama has been encouraging Summers to serve in his administration in some other role, perhaps as chair of the National Economic Council. Some Democrats suggest that Obama plans to name Summers chairman of the Federal Reserve when Bernanke’s term expires at the beginning of 2010. If for some reason Summers does not go to NEC, the leading candidate is Jack Lew, currently the Chief Operating Officer of Citigroup’s Alternative Investments unit. Lew served as director of the Office of Management and Budget for President Bill Clinton. He and Dan Tarullo, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs under Clinton — who was earlier this week named leader of the Obama Transition Team’s Economic Policy Working Group — may both end up working at NEC. Peter Orszag, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, will become Obama’s OMB director. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson is a strong contender to be Obama’s Secretary of Commerce. Some high profile women are being considered for key economic slots. Laura D’Andrea Tyson, the former chair of President Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers, and could also play a key role in the Obama administration. The question right now — what job to give her? Would deputy Treasury Secretary be enough to lure her east from the San Francisco area, where she’s a professor at the Haas School of Business of the University of California, Berkeley. Interestingly, though it’s unclear what the Obama Team will decide, there is a lot of support among Democrats on Capitol Hill for Sheila Bair, the Republican chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., to stay on board. In addition to wanting the best team he can put together, the Transition Team’s goal is to assemble a group that can work well together, with as few confirmation issues as possible. – Jake Tapper and George Stephanopoulos Summary:","completion":"President-elect Obama has chosen New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner as the next Secretary of the Treasury, with plans to announce his nomination early next week.

(CNN) -- Three people have been charged in last year's theft of the famous \\"Arbeit Macht Frei\\" sign at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, a prosecutor said Friday. The prosecutor, Robert Parys, said he could not immediately confirm details about those charged, but Poland's official PAP news agency reported the main suspect is a Swedish man, Anders Hoegstroem. Prosecutors say Hoegstroem incited two Poles to steal the sign, which sat atop the entrance to the camp, PAP reported. He pleaded not guilty, and would face a sentence of 10 years in prison if convicted, the news agency reported. Hoegstroem was arrested in February in Stockholm, Sweden, and the Swedish court allowed him to be transferred to Poland in April, PAP said. The sign reading \\"Arbeit Macht Frei\\" -- German for \\"Work Sets You Free\\" -- was emblematic of the Nazi camps of World War II. It was stolen in December of last year, prompting outrage around the world. The sign was found 70 hours later in a village near Torun, roughly 210 miles (340 kilometers) to the north, and had been chopped into three parts, PAP reported. The men managed to remove the heavy iron sign by unscrewing it from one side and pulling off on the other, police spokeswoman Agnieszka Szczygiel said at the time.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Texas Is Pressed to Spare Mexican Citizen on Death Row In another sense, though, Mr. Leal’s case is different from those of the six men Texas has already put to death this year. He is a citizen of Mexico. After his arrest, he was denied his rights under the Vienna Convention to consult Mexican consular officials. Had his government been allowed to come to his aid, Mr. Leal’s lawyers say, he might still have been convicted. But they say that legal help from the Mexican government would almost certainly have kept him off death row. Former judges, law enforcement officials, military leaders and diplomats have lined up on Mr. Leal’s side. Most take no position on Mr. Leal’s guilt or on the death penalty. Their argument is more practical. “If we do not comply with our obligations under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the U.N. Charter,” said John B. Bellinger III, who was the State Department’s top lawyer in the administration of President George W. Bush, “we put at risk Americans, including Texans, who travel and may be arrested overseas. It is surprising that Texas does not recognize the risks it may be creating for its own citizens.” True, Texas provided Mr. Leal with a lawyer. But the convention requires that arrested foreigners also be told of their right to speak with consular officials and to be put in contact with them “without delay.” Billy Hayes, whose ordeal in a Turkish prison was the subject of the movie “Midnight Express,” wrote a letter to Gov. Rick Perry this month urging him to grant a reprieve to Mr. Leal. In an interview last week, Mr. Hayes said he could not have imagined negotiating the Turkish legal system without the emotional support and logistical help that American diplomats provided. “It’s a different country,” he said, “different language, different law and different rules.” Mr. Leal, by contrast, did not learn of his rights until two years after his conviction, and even then not from American authorities but from a fellow inmate. In 2004, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled for Mr. Leal and other Mexican inmates on death row in the United States, saying that American courts must grant “review and reconsideration” to claims that their cases had been hurt by the failure of the local authorities to allow them to contact consular officials. In 2005, Mr. Bush told state officials that they must comply with the international court’s decision. Mr. Bush’s memorandum puzzled officials in Texas, who said it seemed inconsistent with the Bush administration’s general hostility to international institutions and its support for the death penalty. Texas refused to go along, and in 2008 the Supreme Court said two things about that. One was that the United States was obligated to comply with the international tribunal’s judgment. The other was that the president alone could not by himself force states to go along; Congress had to act, too. Such legislation was submitted in the Senate this month. Its prospects are unclear, but it certainly won’t be enacted by July 7, when Mr. Leal is scheduled to die. Mr. Leal’s lawyers asked Judge Orlando L. Garcia of Federal District Court in San Antonio to stay the execution. Sandra L. Babcock, one of Mr. Leal’s lawyers, explained the legal theory behind the request. “He has a due process right,” she said of her client, “to remain alive while Congress has a meaningful opportunity to consider and pass this legislation.” Judge Garcia rejected the request on Wednesday. “The filing of a legislative proposal in the form of a bill is of no legal consequence,” he wrote. Mr. Leal has also asked the governor for a reprieve. Mr. Perry’s press secretary, Katherine Cesinger, suggested that he did not view the matter through the lens of reciprocal international obligations. “If you commit the most heinous of crimes in Texas,” she said, “you can expect to face the ultimate penalty under our laws, as in this case.” There is substantial evidence, including statements from Mr. Leal, that he was involved in the gruesome 1994 killing of Adria Sauceda, 16. Mr. Leal’s lawyers concede that “the argument that Mr. Leal was responsible for Ms. Sauceda’s death was at least plausible.” But they say prosecutors transformed what should have been at most a manslaughter charge into one for capital murder by saying Mr. Leal had kidnapped and raped Ms. Sauceda. “For this,” the lawyers wrote in their brief seeking a stay, “the state built its case on junk science, willful ignorance and profoundly problematic DNA evidence.” Mr. Leal’s court-appointed lawyer failed to investigate or challenge questionable evidence, and he did not present information about Mr. Leal’s background that might have supported a plea for leniency. Would a better lawyer retained by the Mexican government have made a difference? Maybe. Or maybe the right question is the one posed years ago by Donald F. Donovan, a New York lawyer who represented the Mexican government in The Hague. “If you were arrested in Damascus and they gave you a dime,” he asked, “would you want to call your court-appointed lawyer or the American Embassy?” Summary:","completion":"A man from Mexico, named Mr. Leal, is in trouble in Texas. You see, he might get a very big punishment called the \\"death penalty\\", which means he could be put to death because of a very, very bad crime he did. But many people are upset because they believe he was not treated fairly. Normally, when someone from another country gets in trouble in the US, they have a right to speak to the officials of their own country for help. This is called the Vienna Convention. But Mr. Leal wasn't told about this right until two years after he was caught. Some big judges and leaders, and even a man who was in a movie called Billy Hayes, argue that it's very important to follow these rules clearly, otherwise other countries might not let Americans get help from their officials when they are in trouble in those countries. Many years ago, an international court in The Hague, which is like a big, worldwide courtroom, said Mr. Leal's case was not treated fairly because he wasn't given his right to speak to Mexican officials. They asked the American courts to relook at Mr. Leal's case. But Texas did not agree to this, and now Mr. Leal's life is in danger as he might get the death penalty soon. His lawyers tried to stop this from happening, but their request was denied. They say Mr. Leal did do something very bad, but not bad enough to get the death penalty. They think this happened because he did not get a good enough lawyer, but we can't say for sure if things would have turned out differently if he had had help from his own country."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Use this fact to answer the question: refraction is when light bends An example of refraction is Pick your answer from: [I] The light that comes from the TV; [II] The light from a fire; [III] Turning the light on; [IV] Pickles seemingly bigger in the jar; The answer is:","completion":"The answer is [IV] Pickles seemingly bigger in the jar. Refraction is the phenomenon that occurs when light passes through different mediums, causing it to change direction or bend. This happens because the speed of light varies in different substances, and as light moves from one medium to another, its speed changes, resulting in a change in direction. In the case of pickles in a jar, the jar is filled with a liquid (usually a mixture of vinegar, water, and salt). When light travels from the air outside the jar through the glass and then through the liquid, it experiences different mediums with varying refractive indexes. The refractive index is a measure of how much a substance can slow down, refract or bend the light waves that pass through it. As the light encounters the glass jar and the liquid, it slows down, which causes the light to bend. This bending of light makes the pickles appear larger than they actually are, creating a magnifying effect. This is an example of refraction in everyday life. Now, let's look at the other options and why they are not examples of refraction: [I] The light that comes from the TV: The light emitted by the TV is a form of electromagnetic radiation that creates the colors and images we see on the screen. Although the light emitted by a TV travels through different layers inside the screen, the light itself does not significantly change its direction or bend in the process, so it is not an example of refraction. [II] The light from a fire: The light emitted by a fire is primarily due to the process of combustion, where chemical energy stored in the fuel is released in the form of heat and light. Although the light from a fire might be scattered in various directions due to its interaction with different particles in the air, it does not involve significant bending of light through different mediums, so it is not an example of refraction. [III] Turning the light on: When you turn on a light, an electrical current flows through a filament or an LED, causing it to emit light. While the process of creating light might involve various physical phenomena, including reflection and absorption within the light bulb itself, it does not involve refraction as the primary feature in this scenario. The focus here is the generation of light rather than the bending of light through different mediums."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: suppose no people put the fire out happens, how will it affect a GREATER negative effect on animals. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in question is that no people put out the fire. The second effect mentioned is \\"those that survive have their habitat destroyed.\\" This effect refers to destruction of habitat as it results from the forest fire. If people do not intervene to put out the fire, it could lead to more widespread and lasting damage to the forest - the habitat of the animals. This implies prolonged exposure of the habitat to damaging conditions. Therefore, if no people put the fire out, it will have a 'more' negative effect on the animals as the destruction of their habitat could be more extensive, exacerbating the situation for the surviving animals. In terms of the supposed perturbation influencing the second effect mentioned, the result would also be ‘more’. That is, the lack of human intervention in extinguishing the fire would result in a greater level of destruction of the habitat, thereby increasing the negative impact for the animals who survive the initial fire. They would have fewer resources available to them, it would be harder for them to find a new suitable habitat, and the subsequent conflicts with other animals (as mentioned in the process) could be more severe. In summary, not intervening to put out the fire would likely amplify the negative effects experienced by the surviving animals, leading to a greater level of negative impact overall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trump blames Assad for the attack. A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution. Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world. The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq.

One of her four best friends playfully pushed her in the pool, causing the life-changing injury.Now, for the first time, the 30-year-old is talking publicly about that friend. She has remained fiercely protective of the woman since the accident, even turning down an interview with Oprah when the talk show queen's bookers said they would only have her on if she came on with that friend.Chapman has never named her childhood friend publicly – and still won't – but for the first time, she is telling PEOPLE exclusively about the broken friendship she says she fought hard to maintain.\\"In the beginning, she was there for me and I was there for her. She was distraught and depressed about what happened. But as the years passed, she didn't make the effort, it was just going through the motions and every time we spoke, I just felt like I was remembering the accident and going into the pool and I had negative feelings. I didn't feel that way in the beginning, but that's what's been happening over the last three years.\\"She says her friend came with a few other girls when Kaylee, who turned one this week, was first born, but that's the last time they were together. She and husband Chris, 33, welcomed Kaylee via surrogate last April.\\"I had to actually cut ties with her and end the friendship,\\" she says. \\"I had to tell her that we couldn't be friends because she just wasn't there for me anymore.\\"Chapman says she was honest after the accident when she was vocal about how the two remained close. But she says when that changed, she realized she needed to be honest once more.\\"One of the things that happens when you have this kind of injury is that you lose people, and I felt like I wasn't being truthful anymore because I did lose some relationships. It's sad and it's complicated, but she wasn't there for me when I needed her.\\"Chapman talks about her lost friendship in a documentary she and husband Chris shot for TLC about their journey to become parents. The network finished shooting in February and tells PEOPLE the as-yet-untitled show will air, they just don't know when.Chapman says she wanted to do the show to let people see the challenges and the joys of becoming a mom, despite being paralyzed.\\"It's so cool, she uses the back of my chair to pull herself up and she has figured out how to come to me when I go to take her out of her crib,\\" she says of her daughter, Kaylee. \\"She turns on her belly and scoots her way on to my lap. She is the only one who looks at me in the chair and it's normal to her because that's all she knows.\\"And this past weekend – as friends and family celebrated Kaylee's first birthday – she walked to her dad. \\"Chris opened his arms and she came to him. Everyone cheered and clapped for her!\\"Chapman is also excited by her newfound independence. A few weeks ago she started driving again for the first time since she was paralyzed.\\"It was a huge mountain to climb and once I did it, it really wasn't that bad at all. It's a workout because I have to get in and out of the chair, but it's nice to know I can go wherever I want, whenever I want.\\"It is a big turning point she says, one that has her excited for the future.\\"It's nice to finally have some independence and to know that I'll be able to do more for Kaylee as she gets older. She laughs all the time and makes me so happy and I just want to be able to do for her.\\" ||||| share tweet pin email Rachelle Chapman considers her daughter “the missing piece” to the home she and her husband created. “I got hurt right before the wedding, so for a long time, all I wanted was to get married,” said the North Carolina mom known around the world as “the paralyzed bride” after a fall into a pool at her bachelorette party left her a quadriplegic. “We were happily wed for a long time, but then I felt that I really wanted a child with Chris.” Rachelle Chapman Rachelle and Chris Chapman, with their daughter, Kaylee, who turns 1 on April 26 The couple’s daughter, Kaylee, turns 1 on Tuesday. Relatives and close friends, including the woman who served as the girl's surrogate, celebrated over the weekend with an Elmo-themed birthday party “because Kaylee is completely obsessed with Elmo,” Chapman told TODAY. “It’s been a blessing and super annoying at the same time!” Chapman said her daughter recently learned how to walk by using her mother’s wheelchair as a prop. “She got a lot of practice holding on to the back of my chair. She would pull up and hold on to the wheel, and then walk to the back and hold on to the bar in the back,” she told TODAY. “My wheelchair was good practice for her. She would basically push my wheelchair. It was so cool she learned how to do that.” Kaylee also has learned to use her special wheelchair-accessible crib to her advantage. She recently learned how to crawl out of it by scooting backward on her stomach and onto her mother's lap. “It’s really hard to just to pick her up and pull her towards me, so this tactic works,” Chapman said. “And she figured it out on her own. Knowing that I can’t reach out and pick her up like everyone else, she just crawled onto my lap on her own.” RELATED: 'Paralyzed bride' finds happiness as a new mom: 'It is a dream come true' Chapman said milestones such as these help quell the criticism she still gets from people who call her selfish for wanting to have a child because of her partial paralysis. Chapman said that single parents rarely get questioned about their fitness to be parents. “Chris and I together as a team are more than capable of taking care of a baby, especially with the help of my mother, who was all in from the beginning,” she said. Rachelle Chapman Rachelle Chapman with her daughter, Kaylee Chapman’s mother lives with the family during the week, mainly to help Chapman get out of bed and into her wheelchair in the mornings, when her husband has to leave for his job as a middle school science teacher. “I want people to realize, yeah, even though my fingers don’t work, I have found a way to manipulate my hands to do a lot of things. I can hold Kaylee. I can feed Kaylee and I can play with her while Chris is washing bottles or whatever. We have a system that works for us,” she said. “And beyond love, Kaylee has a house over her head and food in her tummy. She’s a happy, happy baby who doesn’t realize that I’m different. This is normal for her.” RELATED: 'What I always wanted': 'Paralyzed bride' expecting first child through surrogate Chapman said she’d love to have more children but doesn’t know if she and her husband could afford the cost of another surrogate. Chapman is unable to sustain a pregnancy on her own because of blood pressure medication she has taken since her accident. “I’d love to have more. We did IVF and I have these healthy embryos sitting in California, but I’d still require a surrogate, and it comes down to money,” she said. Courtesy of Rachelle Chapman Chapman's daughter, Kaylee Chapman has been working with the cable network TLC over the past year on an upcoming one-hour show that focuses on her journey to becoming a mother. The show also will feature her talking publicly for the first time about her relationship with the friend whose playful push into the pool led to her accident. “I didn’t blame her for hurting me, because we’ve all pushed somebody in a pool and I was very supportive of her. The first year I made sure that she was OK, even more than me,” said Chapman, who still refuses to disclose the woman's name. Eventually, the relationship grew strained. \\"We aren’t very close friends anymore and I talk about it for the first time on the show,\\" she said. In addition to becoming a mom within the last year, Chapman also learned how to drive her wheelchair-adapted van. She had delayed learning how, mainly because she's never driven a vehicle so large. But after realizing one day that she had no way of getting to her wheelchair rugby practice, she decided it was time to learn. “Eventually, I want to be able to take Kaylee to dance class or tennis lessons and not have to rely on somebody else to do that,” she said. \\"Once she can get in and out of her car seat on her own, or old enough not to need one at all, I'll be able to do that.\\" Follow TODAY.com writer Eun Kyung Kim on Twitter. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Rachelle Chapman, a 30-year-old woman from Knightdale, North Carolina, who became known as the \\"paralyzed bride\\" when a freak accident at her bachelorette party left her paralyzed from the chest down, has opened up about the friend who caused the accident and the end of their friendship.

How to ice cookies Bake your cookies and allow them to cool. Fresh from your oven, your cookies will be too hot to handle, but even warm cookies can cause your icing to melt and ruin your designs. To prevent this from happening, wait until the cookies are cool to the touch before icing.","completion":"Step 1: Prepare the icing Gather all the necessary ingredients and tools to prepare the icing. Select the desired icing type, such as royal icing, powdered sugar icing, or buttercream icing. You will also need mixing bowls, whisks or electric mixers, food coloring, and piping bags or plastic bags with a small hole cut in one corner to apply the icing. Step 2: Mix the icing Combine the ingredients according to the chosen icing recipe, being sure to achieve the correct consistency. Too thin, and the icing will run off the edges of the cookie; too thick, and it will be difficult to pipe from the bag. Adjust the consistency by adding more powdered sugar for thickness or liquid for thinning. Step 3: Color the icing Divide the icing into separate bowls for each desired color. Add a few drops of food coloring to each bowl and mix the colors thoroughly. It's best to start with a small amount and gradually add more to achieve the desired shade. Step 4: Fill the piping bags Transfer the colored icing into piping or plastic bags, taking care not to overfill them. Twist the top of the bag to secure and hold it in place, squeezing out any air bubbles. Step 5: Outline the cookies Hold the bag at a 45-degree angle, gently applying pressure to the icing to create an outline around the cookie's edges. This will help prevent the icing from flowing off the sides during the filling process. Be sure to keep a steady hand. Step 6: Flood the cookies Using the same icing bag or a new one with a wider hole, fill the inside of the outline by gently squeezing the icing, moving back and forth to cover the surface. You can use a toothpick or small spatula to spread the icing evenly and fill any gaps. Step 7: Add details or decorations Once the base layer of icing has been applied, add any desired designs, patterns, or sprinkles while the icing is still wet. This will help the decorations adhere to the cookie. Step 8: Allow the icing to dry Depending on the type and thickness of the icing, drying times can vary from 30 minutes to several hours. It's essential to give the icing enough time to set and harden before handling or stacking the cookies to prevent smudging or damage to the design. By following these steps, you can create beautifully iced cookies that both look great and taste delicious. Remember to be patient and creative, as practice will lead to more consistent results and impressive cookie art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Joe unit, which is framed for stealing nuclear warheads from Pakistan by Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce). The unit is subsequently decimated in a military air strike with Duke among the casualties. The only survivors are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). Meanwhile, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) rescue Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) from an underground maximum-security prison in Germany, leaving Destro behind. Storm Shadow is injured during the escape and retreats to a temple in the Himalayas to recover. Upon learning that he is alive, the Blind Master (RZA), leader of the Arashikage Clan, sends Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and his apprentice Jinx (Ãlodie Yung), Storm Shadow's cousin, to capture Storm Shadow so he can answer for the murder of his uncle, the Hard Master. Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye return to the United States where they set up a base of operations in a rundown gym. After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as America's elite special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that the President will be attending.

Short movie review: strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"From the given short movie review, it seems that the critic is expressing a somewhat negative opinion about the movie. The comparison being made in the review is between the main actor or character, presumably Schneider, and Steve Martin, a renowned actor, comedian, and writer. Steve Martin is widely known for his comic performances and skills in the entertainment industry, with a long and successful career. The statement \\"strictly speaking, Schneider is no Steve Martin\\" implies that the critic believes Schneider doesn't possess the same level of talent, charisma, or comedic ability that Steve Martin has. This suggests that the critic may have expected more from the movie or the performance of Schneider and was left unimpressed or disappointed. The use of \\"strictly speaking\\" indicates that this may be a specific observation or point that the critic wishes to highlight as opposed to a general condemnation of Schneider's talents or abilities. However, it does show that, in this particular instance, the critic thinks that the performance of Schneider did not live up to the standards set by Steve Martin. In conclusion, analyzing the given short movie review, it can be inferred that the critic holds a negative view or impression about the movie, specifically from the comparative perspective of Schneider's performance to that of the esteemed Steve Martin.

Mitä objektiivisia tietoja on siitä, ettei kyseinen pyynti kalajauheteollisuutta varten vaikuta ihmisravinnoksi tarkoitettujen kalakantojen tilaan? Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The original question in Finnish is: \\"Mitä objektiivisia tietoja on siitä, ettei kyseinen pyynti kalajauheteollisuutta varten vaikuta ihmisravinnoksi tarkoitettujen kalakantojen tilaan?\\" The English translation would be: \\"What objective information is there to suggest that the catch intended for the fishmeal industry does not have an impact on the condition of fish stocks destined for human consumption?\\" Now, to provide a detailed and long answer: There are several factors and sources of objective information that can be used to evaluate the impact of the fishmeal industry on fish stocks destined for human consumption. 1. Catch quotas and regulations: The fishmeal industry mainly targets species of fish that are generally low in the food chain, such as anchovies, menhaden, and herring. Authorities set strict catch quotas and regulations for these species to ensure their sustainable harvesting and minimal impact on ecosystems, including fish stocks relevant to human food consumption. By adhering to these quotas, the fishing industry can minimize the negative impact on fish stocks. 2. Alternative sources of raw material: The fishmeal industry is increasingly using sources other than wild-caught fish to produce fishmeal and fish oil. These alternative sources include fish processing by-products (e.g., fish heads, tails, and bones) and farmed fish, which help reduce the pressure on wild fish populations. Additionally, technological innovations in aquaculture are making it increasingly feasible to sustainably produce fishmeal without relying heavily on the catch of wild fish. 3. Scientific research and monitoring: National and international research institutes conduct regular assessments of fish stocks, including those targeted by the fishmeal industry. These assessments are necessary to provide appropriate management measures, ensuring that the exploitation of fish stocks remains within sustainable limits without negatively affecting the fish stocks destined for human consumption. 4. Ecosystem-based management approach: Fisheries management is transitioning to a more ecosystem-based approach, considering the complex interactions between different species and their environment. This transition aims to ensure the sustainable use of marine resources, minimizing the impact of fishmeal industry activities on fish stocks relevant to human food consumption. 5. Certification schemes: The fishmeal industry can voluntarily participate in certification schemes such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and the Global Standard for Responsible Supply (IFFO RS). These certifications provide assurance to customers that the fishmeal used in animal and aquaculture feeds is produced from responsibly managed and sustainable sources, preventing overfishing and minimizing the impact on fish stocks destined for human consumption. 6. Public awareness and market-driven initiatives: Increasing public concern about the environmental impact of food production, including the sustainability of fishmeal production, encourages companies in the fishmeal industry to adopt more sustainable and responsible practices. The market-driven initiatives by responsible stakeholders further reinforce the industry's endeavors to protect fish stocks. In summary, objective information showing that fish intended for the fishmeal industry does not affect the condition of fish stocks destined for human consumption includes catch quotas and regulations, alternative sources of raw material, scientific research and monitoring, ecosystem-based management approaches, certification schemes, and increased public awareness and market-driven initiatives. While this provides a level of assurance, continuous efforts are required to ensure the sustainable management of fish stocks and the responsible operation of the fishmeal industry."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Passage: The number of species of flowering plants is estimated to be in the range of 250,000 to 400,000. This compares to around 12,000 species of moss or 11,000 species of pteridophytes, showing that the flowering plants are much more diverse. The number of families in APG (1998) was 462. In APG II (2003) it is not settled; at maximum it is 457, but within this number there are 55 optional segregates, so that the minimum number of families in this system is 402. In APG III (2009) there are 415 families.","completion":"Part #1: Creating questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage. Usage: \\"How many species of coniferous plants are there?\\" This example meets the criteria in part 1 because it requires a constraint (number of species of coniferous plants) that hasn't been mentioned in the passage. Part #2: Creating questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer. Usage: \\"Which family had the highest increase of species from APG (1998) to APG II (2003)?\\" This illustrates the criteria in part 2 as the passage doesn't provide sufficient information about the increase or decrease of species in any family. Part #3: Replacing an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with another entity, number, date and use it in the question. Usage: \\"In APG IV (2014), how many families were there?\\" This exemplifies the criteria in part 3 because it replaces the existing APG dates in the passage with a new date, APG IV (2014), leading to an unanswerable question based on provided passage. Part #4: Creating a question which is answerable from the passage and then replacing one or two words by their antonyms or inserting/removing negation words to make it unanswerable. Usage: \\"The number of species of moss is more diverse than that of flowering plants. Right?\\" This fits the criteria of part 4 because it takes the statement from the passage that flowering plants are more diverse than mosses and reverses it to form an unanswerable question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. - MinneapolisSaint Paul is a major metropolitan area built around the Mississippi, Minnesota and St. Croix rivers in east central Minnesota. The area is commonly known as the Twin Cities after its two largest cities, Minneapolis, the city with the largest population in the state, and Saint Paul, the state capital. It is an example of twin cities in the sense of geographical proximity. Minnesotans often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro area collectively) as The Cities. - A bus (archaically also omnibus, multibus, motorbus, autobus) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common type of bus is the single-decker rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special licence above and beyond a regular driver's licence. - The Horn of Africa (, \\"yäafrika qänd\\", \\"al-qarn al-'afrq\\") (shortened to HOA) is a peninsula in Northeast Africa. It juts hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. The area is the easternmost projection of the African continent. The Horn of Africa denotes the region containing the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The Territory of Minnesota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 3, 1849, until May 11, 1858, when the eastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Minnesota. - Voter turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot in an election.

G.\\" Wells (21 September 1866 13 August 1946) was an English writer. He was prolific in many genres, including the novel, history, politics, social commentary, and textbooks and rules for war games. Wells is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is called a \\"father of science fiction\\", along with Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback. His most notable science fiction works include \\"The Time Machine\\" (1895), \\"The Island of Doctor Moreau\\" (1896), \\"The Invisible Man\\" (1897), and \\"The War of the Worlds\\" (1898).

It was founded in 1996 by literature professor and poet Mary Elizabeth Parker with the financial backing of Michael Dana. The competition is currently based in Greensboro, North Carolina. The judges for the competition include Scottish novelist Margot Livesey. - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - Greensboro (formerly Greensborough) is a city in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is the third-largest city by population in North Carolina and the county seat and largest city in Guilford County and the surrounding Piedmont Triad metropolitan region. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 269,666, and in 2015 the estimated population was 285,342. Three major interstate highways (Interstate 85, Interstate 40 and Interstate 73) in the Piedmont region of central North Carolina were built to intersect at this city. - Margot Livesey (born 1953) is a Scottish born writer.

Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story. - Leon Eugene Stover (April 9, 1929 November 25, 2006) was an anthropologist, a Sinologist, and a science fiction fan, who wrote both fiction and nonfiction. He was a scholar of the works of H. G. Wells and Robert A. Heinlein and a frequent collaborator with Harry Harrison. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Henrietta Maria of France (25 November 1609 10 September 1669) was queen consort of England, Scotland, and Ireland as the wife of King Charles I. She was mother of his two immediate successors, Charles II and James II. - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. - Ruben Toledo (born 1961, Havana, Cuba) is a Cuban-American artist based in New York City. - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\" - Charles I (19 November 1600 30 January 1649) was monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649. - Laren Stover ( b. Maryland ) is an American writer .

Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What's the profession of the person who causes Lucy to want to leave early? from the following article ? Lucy Harmon, a nineteen-year-old American, is the daughter of well-known (now deceased) poet and model, Sara Harmon. The film opens as Lucy arrives for a vacation at the Tuscan villa of Sara's old friends, Ian and Diana Grayson (played by Donal McCann and Cusack, respectively). Other guests include a prominent New York art gallery owner, an Italian advice columnist and an English writer, Alex Parrish, who is dying of an unspecified disease. Lucy goes for a swim, and finds that Diana's daughter from a previous marriage, Miranda Fox, is also there with her boyfriend, entertainment lawyer Richard Reed. Miranda's brother, Christopher, is supposed to be there, but he is off on a road trip with the Italian son of a neighboring villa, Niccoló Donati. Lucy was particularly hoping to see Niccoló, whom she had met on a previous visit to the villa, four years earlier, and who was the first boy she'd ever kissed. Lucy and Niccoló had briefly exchanged letters after this first visit. One letter in particular Lucy had admired so much she memorized it. Lucy reveals to the gallerist that she is there to have her portrait made by Ian, who is a sculptor. She says it's really just an excuse for her father to send her to Italy, \\"as a present.\\" Smoking marijuana with Parrish, Lucy reveals that she is a virgin. When Parrish shares this information with the rest of the villa the next day, Lucy is furious and decides to cut her visit short.

Choose your answer from: --They would be in bed in PJ 's; --None of the above choices .; --They would have met up with their husband; --They would not have met up with their husband; Q: What would have happened had the narrator not gotten sick ?","completion":"Had the narrator not gotten sick, they had a quite interesting and exciting plan in place. The plan involved attending two different parties ensuring they would get plenty of social interactions, joviality, and laughter. First, they planned to go to Nessa's party. The fact that the narrator planned to \\"swing by\\" suggests that this wouldn't have been a long, all night stay, but rather a short visit likely to show their face, engage in a bit of friendly chat, and perhaps enjoy some of the party food and drink. The use of the term \\"swing by\\" implies a degree of casualness, suggesting this might be a relatively informal social event like a house party or a casual gathering of friends. It could be assumed Nessa is a friend or an acquaintance that the narrator wanted to catch up with or perhaps, maintain a good relationship with. The narrator wasn’t planning on ending their night at Nessa's. They planned on going over to Rob's party afterwards. This multi-location party plan suggests the narrator had a high energy, outgoing itinerary for the night, further highlighted by how they mentioned this in contrast to their current situation of being sick. The interesting twist is that the narrator intended to meet up with their husband at Rob's party. This suggests that the husband was a critical part of this plan. This detail indicates that they may not have been at home together earlier or they might have planned to attend separate parties first before meeting up. Their meeting at Rob’s party could have been an opportunity for the couple to catch up, enjoy themselves together in a social setting or simply have a good time dancing, chit-chatting, and celebrating. The mention of meeting the husband perhaps implies a source of happiness and excitement- a highlight of their night. So, under normal circumstances, had the narrator not fallen sick, they would have had an exciting, social, and love-filled evening attending multiple parties and meeting up with their husband.

I discovered this place not too terribly long ago, and as Paolo D. said, 28GO is minimalistic (but cool), Anime Ramen & Teriaki takes the idea and runs. Don't get me wrong: I like my anime. I grew up on the staples of Akira, Fist of the North Star, Vampire Hunter D and a good ol' fashioned Studio Ghibli film or five. This place really took me to that nerdtastic time in my life. The set-up is great: Bright, cheery, with upbeat J-Pop playing as anime dressed girls greet you in Japanese. The art is everywhere, but is very nice and classy (I do wish they had some of the old-school classics, but what they had was fun). On TV, some Pokemon episode was playing. When we walked in, we were the only ones there. About halfway through our meal, the place became packed. Talk about good timing. The food, however, was just right for the outing. Their gyoza is pretty darn tasty, as are their HUGE bowls of ramen. Everything was hot and flavorful. Even their boba teas were excellent and sweet. Service was very nice. The girls checked by often, but not enough to become overbearing. They were always on top of things, and super friendly. I appreciate the effort they put into their costumes. It's not as crazy as some theme restaurants that I've been, but it still makes it point that the name of their game is anime. Even their little business cards are styled after one of those trading card games, which I found charming. It's the appreciation to details (and the tasty food) that made this experience memorable. So memorable, in fact, that it ensures that I'll be going to this place again, and soon. It's a neat, clever idea, and I'm glad that someone obviously has fun with the business that they run.

And while it would not be a far stretch of the imagination to assume an 8-year-old's cooking show would be filled with dishes like pizza and burgers, Arthur's show actually features recipes like fruit salad a la creme de passion fruit and filet mignon . The idea to record Arthur's cooking adventures on YouTube was rooted in the young chef's leukemia diagnosis in August 2013.Treatment and recovery for the cancer left the young boy in the hospital for the second half of the year and Aruthur was even forced to spend Christmas Eve in the emergency room of So Paulo's A.C. Camargo Cancer Center. That's when his family--father Renato Gonzaga and stepmother Priscila Inserra--decided that Arthur should create something positive that would distract him from his health. The videos, which are filmed in the kitchen of a friend of the family, are in Portuguese. They show Arthur walking the viewers through a step-by-step process of the entire recipe--from preparation to cooking. Occasionally, viewers can see Arthur's father serving as his son's _ , passing ingredients and following his lead. Fluent in Portuguese or not, viewers can immediately notice Arthur's optimistic and friendly personality. It is perhaps these qualities that have given the young rising Internet star almost 5,000 likes on his Facebook Fan Page. There are currently three videos on YouTube and according to his most recent Facebook post, the young boy will be taking suggestions for his next video. Fortunately, according to what Inserra told TheHuffingtonPost, Arthur is responding well to his treatments and is on his path to recovery. \\"The secret of life is to let it take you, to have fun and to know how to turn lemons into lemonade ,\\" wrote her family, fittingly, on their most recent Facebook post.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In this task, you're given the title of a story consisting of five sentences, numbered 1 through 5. Your job is to determine which two sentences need to be swapped sentences in order to make a story that makes complete sense and is befittingly titled. Indicate your answer using the numbers of the two sentences in order, such as '34' or '25'. The first digit refers to the sentence which should come first in the story. Title: Self Employed. Sentence 1: I am self-employed via online freelancing platforms. Sentence 2: I find that it makes me need to rush through some tasks. Sentence 3: If I slow down then my rate of pay declines. Sentence 4: It is motivational but also stressful. Sentence 5: My own work ethic guides my rate of pay.","completion":"After reading through all the sentences, the story doesn't seem to flow naturally. Taking into consideration the title 'Self Employed', it can be deduced that the story is about one's experience being self-employed. Therefore, the sequence of experiences and the narrator's thoughts should be logically ordered for the story to make complete sense. Right now, the sequence is as follows: Sentence 1 talks about being self-employed, Sentence 2 jumps to the feeling of needing to rush tasks, Sentence 3 introduces the relation between speed and pay, Sentence 4 describes the emotional response, and Sentence 5 circles back to how the work ethic influences pay. The seeming disarray in the sequence arises from Sentences 3 and 5; both have a relation with 'pay' but are separated. It would make more sense if these two sentences were next to each other in the narrative because they're closely related. Therefore, Sentence 3: 'If I slow down then my rate of pay declines' should be moved right after Sentence 2: 'I find that it makes me need to rush through some tasks', creating a direct cause-effect relationship. Sentence 5: 'My own work ethic guides my rate of pay' should then follow, creating a natural flow and clarifying the relationship between the work ethic, rate of speed and rate of pay. Then Sentence 4: 'It is motivational but also stressful' seems to be the logical conclusion of this chain of thoughts. With this rearrangement, the answer would be '35', i.e., swap Sentence 3 and Sentence 5. Here's the rearranged story: 1: I am self-employed via online freelancing platforms. 2: I find that it makes me need to rush through some tasks. 5: My own work ethic guides my rate of pay. 3: If I slow down then my rate of pay declines. 4: It is motivational but also stressful."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - West Virginia is a state located in the Appalachian region of the Southern United States. It is bordered by Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Ohio to the northwest, Pennsylvania to the north (and, slightly, east), and Maryland to the northeast. West Virginia is the 41st largest by area, the 38th most populous, and has the second lowest household income of the 50 United States. The capital and largest city is Charleston. - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States. Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia, in 1792 Kentucky became the 15th state to join the Union. Kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States. - A vineyard is a plantation of grape-bearing vines, grown mainly for winemaking, but also raisins, table grapes and non-alcoholic grape juice. The science, practice and study of vineyard production is known as viticulture. - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles. - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England. - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish). - Aspen Hill is a farmhouse , built about 1840 near Charles Town , Virginia ( now in West Virginia ) , by James G. Hurst , a middle - tier farmer and landowner , who sought to build a residence befitting his rising status . The house occupies a middle ground between the grand mansions of the landed gentry and the more humble dwellings of more modest farmers . The house lacks some of the details and craftsmanship present in more substantial houses . - An orchard is an intentional planting of trees or shrubs that is maintained for food production. Orchards comprise fruit- or nut-producing trees which are generally grown for commercial production. Orchards are also sometimes a feature of large gardens, where they serve an aesthetic as well as a productive purpose. A fruit garden is generally synonymous with an orchard, although it is set on a smaller non-commercial scale and may emphasize berry shrubs in preference to fruit trees. Most temperate-zone orchards are laid out in a regular grid, with a grazed or mown grass or bare soil base that makes maintenance and fruit gathering easy. - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus. - Poultry are domesticated birds kept by humans for the eggs they produce, their meat, their feathers, or sometimes as pets. These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, quails and turkeys) and the family Anatidae, in order Anseriformes, commonly known as \\"waterfowl\\" and including domestic ducks and domestic geese. Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of pigeons (known as squabs) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game. The word \\"poultry\\" comes from the French/Norman word \\"poule\\", itself derived from the Latin word \\"pullus\\", which means small animal. - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. - In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. - Appalachia is a cultural region in the Eastern United States that stretches from the Southern Tier of New York to northern Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. While the Appalachian Mountains stretch from Belle Isle (Newfoundland and Labrador) in Canada to Cheaha Mountain in Alabama, the cultural region of Appalachia typically refers only to the central and southern portions of the range. As of the 2010 United States Census, the region was home to approximately 25 million people. - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies.

A: The answer is:","completion":"The movement of continents towards the poles or the equator is primarily caused by the phenomenon of plate tectonics. The Earth's outer shell, called the lithosphere, is divided into several large and small plates that constantly move and interact with one another. These plates are composed of the Earth's crust and a portion of the upper mantle, and they float on a more fluid and partially molten layer called the asthenosphere. The movement of these plates is driven by various forces caused by processes occurring in the Earth's interior. These forces include: 1. Mantle convection: The heat generated by the decay of radioactive elements in the Earth's mantle causes this semi-solid layer to slowly circulate and convect, similar to the way water boils in a pot. This convection moves the plates floating above the mantle in different directions. 2. Slab pull: At convergent plate boundaries, where one plate is forced under another (a process called subduction), the weight of the sinking plate creates a pulling force, which causes the plate to move. 3. Ridge push: At divergent plate boundaries, where plates are moving away from each other, the formation of new lithosphere at mid-ocean ridges creates a pushing force, causing the plates to move away from the ridge. These forces interact to move the Earth's tectonic plates in various directions, causing the continents to drift closer to the poles or the equator over millions of years. Additionally, plate movements can also cause continents to converge, diverge, or transform past one another. It is essential to note that these processes occur on a large geological timescale and are not apparent in human timescales. In summary, the drifting of continents closer to the poles or the equator is primarily driven by plate tectonics and the various forces associated with it, including mantle convection, slab pull, and ridge push. These processes occur over millions of years and continuously change the Earth's surface and the position of continents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The nurse, a gentle woman with a kind smile, replied warmly, \\"This is your new baby sister, Elara.\\" Brenna's eyes widened in a mix of awe and confusion as she looked down at the tiny, fragile being cradled in her embrace. The infant's delicate fingers wrapped around one of Brenna's, clutching it tightly as if seeking comfort from the unfamiliar surroundings. With eyes closed, the baby's face was serene, her soft breaths punctuating the stillness of the room. Morgana, the family’s loyal feline companion, had always known she was something special. Ever since Brenna had rescued her from the chilly nights and unwelcoming streets, the two had formed an unbreakable bond. Day in and day out, the duo would engage in heartwarming rituals - from morning cuddles to evening play sessions - carving their memories into the very fabric of their shared lives. Roshan watched the unfolding scene with mixed emotions, his heart aching at the thought of losing even a fraction of Brenna's love to the tiny newcomer. Although he tried to push away the tendrils of insecurity creeping into the recesses of his mind, he couldn't shake off the lingering sensation that things were about to change. Forever. The nurse, recognizing the uncertain atmosphere, kindly spoke up, \\"It's natural for families to feel this way when a new member arrives.

As the days turned into weeks, they navigated unfamiliar territory, learning and growing with each passing moment. Morgana's jealousy eventually subsided, replaced by a newfound curiosity that led her to develop an unlikely affection for baby Elara. Through tender sniffs and nuzzles, their bond strengthened, as did Roshan's, who soon found his own heart expanding with immeasurable love for his new baby sister. Brenna, now a proud big sister, devoted her energy to not only caring for Elara, but also nurturing the precious bonds with both Roshan and Morgana, recognizing that their love was not finite but ever-growing. In time, the family discovered that Elara's arrival had not fragmented their love, but had instead amplified it. The kaleidoscope of emotions that had once filled the room - doubt, jealousy, fear - had transformed into a powerful, magical force. A force so strong, it eclipsed everything that had come before. As they moved forward, hand in hand and paw in paw, they embraced the shared spirit of love that now united them more closely than ever. For they had learned that love, like the twinkling stars in the night sky, knew no bounds but only expanded endlessly, connecting them all in an invisible web of warmth and belonging."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bank town on the other hand, had warmer nights because it was situated on a south facing hill. Which town experienced a higher air mixing ratio? Hint: Specific humidity (or moisture content) is the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of the moist air parcel.[13] Specific humidity is approximately equal to the mixing ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of dry air for the same parcel. As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bend Town experienced a higher air mixing ratio during the humid season. To understand why this is the case, we must first consider the factors that influence air mixing ratio. As mentioned in the hint, specific humidity is approximately equal to the mixing ratio, and it refers to the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air in an air parcel. The main factors affecting air mixing ratio are temperature and relative humidity. When the temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. This means that at lower temperatures, the air can hold less water vapor before becoming fully saturated. Considering the situation described, Bend town and Bank town are both experiencing the same humid season, which suggests they might have similar levels of moisture in the air due to their geographic proximity. However, the significant difference between the two towns is the temperature at night – Bend town has cooler air, while Bank town has warmer nights due to its location on a south-facing hill. During the night, the temperatures in Bend town decrease, and its capacity to hold water vapor decreases as well. This results in a higher level of saturation, which in turn leads to a higher mixing ratio of water vapor in the air. On the other hand, Bank town's warmer nights mean that the air's capacity to hold water vapor remains relatively high, resulting in a lower mixing ratio as compared to Bend town. In summary, Bend town experienced a higher air mixing ratio due to the cooler temperatures at night, which decreased the air's capacity to hold water vapor and increased the level of saturation. Conversely, Bank town experienced a lower air mixing ratio due to its warmer nights, which maintained a higher capacity for holding water vapor and decreased saturation level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"IBM is investing heavily in research and development of semiconductor chips that are used in everything from mainframe computers to cell phone and video game consoles\\" correctly answer the question \\"On what type of research is IBM currently spending more than 500 million dollars a year?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the response \\"IBM is investing heavily in research and development of semiconductor chips that are used in everything from mainframe computers to cell phones and video game consoles\\" correctly answers the question.

Establishing and maintaining a consistent bedtime routine tailored to suit your personal preferences can aid in signaling to your brain that it's time to unwind and prepare for sleep. Some of the activities you can include in your bedtime routine are as follows: 1. Engage in relaxation techniques: Various techniques like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation can help reduce stress, anxiety, and create a calm state of mind before sleep. 2. Decrease screen time: Limit exposure to electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers at least an hour before bedtime. The blue light emitted from these devices can interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that affects your sleep cycle. 3. Create a sleep-friendly environment: A quiet, dark, and comfortable bedroom can enhance your sleep quality. Invest in blackout curtains or a sleep mask to block out any light and reduce noise distractions with earplugs or a white noise machine. 4. Read or listen to calming music: Reading a book, magazine, or listening to soft, soothing music can help clear your mind of stress and daily worries. 5. Practice journaling: Writing down your thoughts, concerns, or making a to-do list for the next day can help empty your mind before sleep and lessen any lingering anxiety. 6. Focus on positive thoughts: Keeping a grateful attitude and concentrating on the things you are thankful for can counterbalance negative thoughts that may keep you awake at night. 7. Indulge in aromatherapy: Using essential oils like lavender, chamomile, or clary sage has been found to promote relaxation and encourage a restful sleep. 8. Enjoy a warm bath or shower: The warm water can help relax your muscles and the temperature change post-bath can bring on the sleepiness. 9. Avoid caffeine and heavy meals before bedtime: Stimulants like caffeine can interfere with your sleep, while heavy meals may cause indigestion and discomfort during the night. By incorporating some or all these habits into your bedtime routine, you create an association between this routine and sleep, making it easier to signal your mind and body to relax and prepare for a good night's rest. As you practice these techniques, you will find it easier to clear your mind and transition into a peaceful and rejuvenating sleep."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the cause? (A). The man called her.. (B). The man stalked her..","completion":"To determine the cause for the woman filing a restraining order against the man, we need to analyze both options (A) and (B). Step 1: Analyze option (A) In option (A), the man called the woman. Although calling someone is not necessarily a harmful act, it can be considered harassment if it is unwanted, repetitive, and threatening. Step 2: Analyze option (B) In option (B), the man stalked the woman. Stalking is a pattern of repeated and unwanted attention, contact, or surveillance directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear. Stalking can involve following, monitoring, harassing, or making threats. This behavior is considered harmful and can lead people to file restraining orders. Step 3: Compare both options Comparing both options, we can notice that stalking (option B) is definitely a more invasive and threatening act. While option (A) could involve harassment, it is not clear whether it was indeed harmful or just an isolated incident.

Question: How did Burke know so much about Rousseau? Context: In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\". Answer:","completion":"Burke knew so much about Rousseau because he was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed during his visit to Britain in 1766-7. Additionally, Burke had read and analyzed Rousseau's works, like the Confessions, which provided him with insights into Rousseau's personality, principles, and actions. This close connection with Hume and the study of Rousseau's writings allowed Burke to form a critical opinion about the French philosopher."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said. Harris spoke after touring a detention facility and speaking with several mothers.​ Trump's call for Congress to postpone action came as House Republican leaders failed to garner enough support for two bills that would overhaul U.S. immigration laws and bolster border security.

Q: Recently the news broke that Microsoft are acquiring GitHub. Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them? A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft.

Title: Disappointing Experience and Poor Service I'm typically not one to leave negative reviews, but my recent experience at [Restaurant Name] was so disheartening that I felt it necessary to share. I had high hopes for this place, as I am a big fan of [Cuisine Type] and had heard good things about the restaurant prior to my visit. 1. Seating and Ambiance: Upon arrival, my party and I were left waiting for nearly 20 minutes just to be seated, despite having made a reservation in advance. The music playing in the background was too loud, making conversation difficult, and the lighting was far too dim to read the menu comfortably. 2. Service: Unfortunately, the lackluster service only added to the disappointment. It took an additional 15 minutes before our server acknowledged our presence and provided us with menus. Throughout the night, the server was inattentive, and we had to ask multiple times for water refills and essential table items like silverware. 3. Food and Presentation: When our food finally arrived, the presentation was underwhelming, to say the least. The [Dish Name] I ordered looked like it had been hastily thrown onto the plate. The taste didn't fare much better, as it was overly salty and undercooked. By the time I flagged down the server to address the issue, my dining companions had finished their meals, leaving me disappointed and hungry. 4. Conclusion: For the steep prices, I expected more from [Restaurant Name]. The lack of attention to detail in every aspect of our dining experience was surprising and left a terrible impression. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this establishment to others looking for enjoyable [Cuisine Type] cuisine.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Getting together with a small group (2-4 people) can shed new light on your training regimen; new people offer new ways to move, different paths to take, and constructive criticism of your methods. Since you have already developed your own style, the ideas offered by new people can only expand your possibilities. Be sure that ideas are not stifled and no individual person sets the bar of what should work for everyone; this method works best as a creative discovery between friends. On the other hand, if you followed someone else's method from the beginning, you could be stuck with a style that does not actually make sense for you. Remember that while large gatherings have the potential to be an extension of the smaller training and discovery sessions, too often they devolve into a roaming herd that quickly grazes over obstacles while looking for the next big trick.

Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning? Adults often remove paper from new nests and use it to recycle old ones . Adults often remove paper from old nests and recycle it to use for new ones .","completion":"While both sentences convey similar information about adults recycling paper from nests, there are subtle differences in their meanings. In the first sentence - \\"Adults often remove paper from new nests and use it to recycle old ones.\\" - the focus seems to be on taking paper from new nests that have not been used or are in the process of being built. The implication is that the new nests are being dismantled, and the paper removed from them is used to fix or restrengthen old nests. This suggests that the old nests are being prioritized, while the construction of new ones is being halted or delayed. In the second sentence - \\"Adults often remove paper from old nests and recycle it to use for new ones.\\" - the focus shifts to taking paper from old nests that have already been used or have served their purpose. Here, the old nests are being dismantled, and their materials are being recycled for building new nests. This statement gives the impression that new nests are being prioritized, while the older ones are considered no longer suitable or necessary. In summary, both sentences involve adults taking paper from nests and recycling it; however, the first sentence implies that paper is taken from new nests to improve old ones, whereas the second sentence suggests that paper is removed from old nests to build new ones. Each sentence focuses on different nest stages and recycling priorities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Translate to English","completion":"\\"So you only know her from before,\\" said Blackburn, as if everything was suddenly starting to make sense. The above sentence is from the Czech language. It portrays a situation where a character, Blackburn, is seemingly putting some pieces of a puzzle together. This may suggest that he was trying to understand the relationship between another character and a lady referred to in the conversation. Knowing her \\"from before\\" could hint that this other character had a past connection with the woman, perhaps an old friendship, a previous romance, or any kind of acquaintance from older times. Blackburn's sudden realization indicates that this piece of information was an important detail, helping him to better comprehend the situation. This could be a snippet from a larger narrative, perhaps a novel, a short story, or a scene in a film or a play. It presents a window into the interactions between characters and suggests a setting where past relationships are of vital relevance. It also offers some insight into Blackburn's character: he seems meticulous and attentive, systematically trying to understand the circumstances by piecing together pieces of information. While translated literally, the sentence delivers a simple fact – that someone only knew a woman from before. However, when placed into a larger context, it can be seen to be a catalyst or turning point within a narrative. It conveys the moment of Blackburn's understanding, a sudden clarity, which could potentially affect the story's direction. Subtleties like these can be key elements in a narrative's progression. They add depth to the characters and their interactions, making the story more engaging and intriguing for the audience.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who was approved as king? , can you please find it? Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, \\"Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his...

It was released on October 24, 1971, as the lead single from his second studio album titled \\"American Pie,\\" which was released in November 1971. The song was written by Don McLean and produced by Ed Freeman. \\"American Pie\\" is a culturally significant song that has a running time of approximately 8 minutes and 33 seconds, making it one of the longest pop songs to gain widespread popularity. It is widely known for its enigmatic and allegorical lyrics that describe various important events and cultural references in contemporary American society at that time. Despite its length, it became a major hit in numerous countries, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States and several other international charts. The song has long been associated with the tragic plane crash that led to the deaths of rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. Richardson, known as The Big Bopper, on February 3, 1959. This event is repeatedly referenced in the song with the line, \\"The day the music died,\\" and serves as a significant milestone in the overall narrative of the song. Over the years, \\"American Pie\\" has been analyzed and interpreted in various ways, as listeners attempt to decipher the exact meaning behind its lyrics and the historical events it alludes to.

We have the equation: -683 * o + 79858 + 6200 = 0 First, we want to add the numbers 79858 and 6200 together. Imagine you have a box of 79858 candies and you put 6200 more candies in it. Let's do that: 79858 (candies) + 6200 (candies) = 86058 (candies) Now, our equation looks like this: -683 * o + 86058 = 0 Our next step is to isolate \\"o\\" (find its value). To do that, we want to move the 86058 to the other side of the equation. Imagine that 86058 candies are on one side of a table and you want to move them to the other side. To make it fair, you need to change the plus sign to a minus sign. It's like taking away the candies instead of adding them. So, our equation becomes: -683 * o = -86058 Now we want to find out how many times \\"-683\\" can be multiplied to get \\"-86058\\". It's like asking how many groups of \\"-683\\" candies can be made from a box with \\"-86058\\" candies. To find this, we'll divide -86058 by -683: -86058 (candies) ÷ -683 (candies per group) = 126 So, we found that \\"o\\" (the number of groups) is 126! That's our solution.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Where did the locomotive that was leased to Michigan in 1970 perform excursion runs after being returned?, using the article: In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s. The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers. The number 1293 was also restored to the engine. In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration. As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive. It was purchased by Blount in May 1965, and renumbered 127. Blount had planned to renumber all three of the series 1200 CRP locomotives in his collection from 1246, 1278, and 1293 to 124, 127 and 129 respectively, but 1278 was the only one of the three that underwent the change. The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored. The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971. After some repair work, the locomotive was returned..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The article does not directly mention where the locomotive performed excursion runs after being returned from Michigan in 1970.

By cooperating with these powers, the EU can play a more active role in creating and enhancing an international landscape that aligns with their values and priorities. The EU's founding treaty, the Treaty of Rome, as well as subsequent treaties, such as the Treaty of Maastricht and the Treaty of Lisbon, established the common values and objectives that serve as the basis for its actions. These shared values include democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and the promotion of peace and stability. Moreover, the treaties laid the groundwork for economic and political cooperation among EU member states. To effectively promote its values and interests, the EU needs to be part of an international environment that supports collaboration and open dialogue. This requires fostering ties with leading regional forces, which are countries or organizations that significantly impact their respective regions. By working together with these powers, the European Union can ensure that it has a strong voice in shaping global politics and policies. Overall, the EU's goal is to work alongside other global players to create a more stable, peaceful, and prosperous international community. This collaborative approach is based on the belief that the more countries and organizations can agree on common values and goals, the more likely they are to achieve them.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Spirited Away Movie plot: Ten-year-old Chihiro (voice: Daveigh Chase in the 2002 English dub) and her parents (voices: Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis) drive to their new home. Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating -- and they've turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents. Chihiro runs back to the river, which was nearly dry when they came over but is now full and large, and she doesn't even recognize the buildings on the far side. As a riverboat approaches, she notices that her body has become transparent.The riverboat lands a big crowd of people in costume -- or maybe they're not people; at first they're only visible as paper masks.

With the help of her friends, including the boy named Haku, Chihiro successfully completes the tasks set by Yubaba, the bathhouse owner, and breaks the curse on her parents. Towards the end of the movie, Chihiro correctly identifies her parents among a group of pigs, which lifts the curse that turned them into pigs in the first place. After this, they all cross the river together, returning to the human world. As they leave the spirit world behind, Chihiro's parents do not remember their experiences as pigs, but Chihiro retains her memories and growth from her time in the spirit world.

Article: A Bite of China, made by CCTV's Documentary Channel, sparked discussion not only on Chinese food, but also on locally made documentary programs. When you think of documentaries, you may think of them as long, boring programs. But documentaries can be wonderful and bring stories from the real world into our homes. With fascinating footage and stories, documentaries encourage us to think about interesting issues we wouldn't necessarily know about. So, what makes a good documentary, and what should we pay attention to when we watch one? Here, we offer a few easy strategies to help you get the most out of watching documentaries. Pay attention to the themes While watching a documentary, keep your eyes and ears peeled for the themes people talk about and what ideas they focus on. Is it meant to be informative or raise a certain emotional response? Think critically Listen to what the people in the documentary are saying and ask yourself the following questions: If you were debating with someone or introducing a new concept, would you say the things the people in the documentary are saying? Do the arguments make sense? Check the sources If you're sitting at the computer and can't think of anything to do, why not look up the points the documentary made and see if they are accurate? You could even read more about what is presented in the documentary. Who are the creators? The creators or financial backers of a film will usually be involved with how the subject matter is presented. For instance, as the documentary 2016: Obama's America was directed in large part by a conservative writer, it's not surprising that it's critical of President Obama from the beginning.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Google Buzz Has Serious Privacy Flaws Users of Google's new social-media utility Buzz are claiming it could allow anyone to see who they have been e-mailing. The world's number one search engine claims Buzz lets users \\"share updates, photos, videos, and more.\\" But users have discovered that unless privacy settings are changed, Buzz publicly shares details of users' contacts. When creating a new account, a dialogue box asks you to create a profile and upload a photograph. Buzz then automatically builds you a buddy list based on names in your Gmail account. But it then makes this list public on your profile, by default. It is a bit like someone being able to peek inside your e-mail folders -- and users who spotted the flaw are astounded. \\"In my profession, where anonymous sourcing is a crucial tool, the implications of this flaw are terrifying,\\" said Buzz user and journalist Nicholas Carson writing for Business Insider. \\"Google should just ask users, 'Do you want to follow these people we've suggested you follow, based on the fact you e-mail and chat with them? This will expose to the public who you e-mail and chat with most.'\\" In response, Google moved to tweak the sign-up process and now claims the opt-out option for a public list is clearer. \\"We think that showing followers publicly by default makes Buzz more useful because it helps people expand their networks,\\" the company said in a statement. \\"In response to feedback, we've made the option to hide these lists more prominent in the set up process.\\" But Nicholas Carson responded: \\"We continue to believe these chances to opt-out do not force the user to make a real choice about this setting.\\" He added, \\"Google could and should simply make this feature 'opt-in' so that people know what they're doing.\\" For more on this story, see SkyNews.com.

She returned to her home on Fakaofo, 200 kilometres away, after the tournament, and emboldened by alcohol they took off after midnight to find her, carrying only a couple of sacks of coconuts, some beer and a fuel tank. After the boat ran out of fuel, they drifted about 1,300 kilometres before being spotted by a fishing boat on its way back to New Zealand on Wednesday. They said they had eaten only a seagull that they managed to catch and had drunk rainwater but started to drink seawater when it did not rain. The trio - Samuelu Peleha (also known as Sam Perez) and Filo Filo, both 15, and Etueni (or Edward) Nasau, 14, gaunt, ill and lucky to be alive were recovering in Suva, capital of Fiji, after being transferred to a navy patrol boat. Two were released into the care of extended family members after being checked by doctors in hospital and the other was detained for further examination, a spokeswoman for the New Zealand High Commission in Suva told the German Press Agency, dpa. Kuresa Nasau, a cousin of the boys and chief of Tokelau's 1,300 people, who live on three atolls hundreds of kilometres apart, was quoted by the Dominion Post as saying nobody saw them go but it would not have been thought unusual. 'Young kids go out fishing all the time, nobody questions that,' he said. 'They were seen at midnight and nobody suspected they were going to take off.' Memorial services for the three were held on Atafu after surveillance flights by the New Zealand air force found no trace of them. Their rescue was hailed as a miracle by friends and relations. Nasau told dpa Friday: 'They must have had a plan to leave the island, they must have thought this was a game, they would arrive at another country soon. 'When they were reported missing on the Tuesday, we were all upset at what they did, leaving the island without telling anyone. But now they are forgiven.' The boat they took was the newest one bought for their small island and he said they would face some hard questions when they returned home. ||||| (CNN) -- A doctor in Fiji is examining three teenage boys rescued 240 miles from land after they were lost in the South Pacific for more than 50 days. Apunas Sakamuri, spokesman for the police department in Suva, Fiji, said the three were admitted to Suva Public Hospital and then released to a private doctor identified as Dr. Rosemary Mitchell. Filo Filo, 15, and his cousins -- Etueni Nasau, 14, and Samu Pelesa, 15 -- were famished, dehydrated, exhausted and sunburned when a crew member on a fishing boat two miles away spotted their 12-foot metal boat and alerted his superior. The rescue, which came two weeks after hundreds turned out to mourn them, elated their friends and relatives. Tanu Filo, whose 15-year-old son Filo was among the survivors, told CNN Thursday in a telephone interview from his native Tokelau Islands that, \\"I was on cloud nine. I was so joyful.\\" \\"I couldn't believe my son and his boys were found again. Unbelievable,\\" said Tanu Filo, who noted that a traditional celebration is now in order. \\"He alerted us that he saw something immediately on our bow, directly in front of us,\\" Tai Fredricsen told CNN Thursday from his 280-foot tuna boat. \\"As we drew closer, we could tell that it was a small boat of some type.\\" The boat was a strange find so far from land. \\"It's not something you go in the open ocean with,\\" he said, noting that the boat was 240 miles northeast of Fiji when it was spotted late Tuesday afternoon. And it got stranger. Inside were three naked teenage boys -- cousins from the Tokelau Islands 750 nautical miles away. Asked whether they needed help, they said yes. When he learned how long they had been adrift, Fredricsen released his rescue boat, took them aboard his fishing boat, the San Nikunau. \\"They looked very bad -- bones protruding from underneath the skin, but mentally strong, strong as an ox,\\" Fredricsen said. He moved them to his cabin's king-sized bed, where \\"they all fit comfortably,\\" and began administering first aid to their burned skin. \\"They were ecstatic,\\" he said. He also gave them electrolyte-spiked liquids as he had been trained to do in a first-aid class. \\"I just gave them very small doses -- they more or less let the drink stay in their mouth and they swirled it around and let it absorb in their cheeks very slowly.\\" After about half an hour, they were able to swallow, but he urged them to go slowly. \\"They knew I was trying to help, and they did what I said. The cooperation was just incredible from the start.\\" After a couple of hours, they were able to eat small pieces of dry white bread, he said. Four hours later, he was feeding them slices of oranges and apples. \\"And then they were starting to get a little bit carried away -- they were wanting some McDonald's or some French fries, but I couldn't allow them to have that yet.\\" After six hours on board, the three teenage boys began to mingle with the crew. By 4:30 a.m. local time Thursday, they were transferred to a Fiji coast guard vessel, destined for a hospital in Suva on that Pacific island, \\"hopefully warm and cozy.\\" Throughout, the boys were smiling, he said. Natives of the Tokelau Islands -- three small atolls in the Pacific Ocean, about midway between New Zealand and Hawaii -- the boys said they had set out in the boat in early October to travel from one island to another, Fredricsen said. \\"The islands are pretty close and they can be transited quite easily with these small vessels,\\" but they got disoriented after losing sight of land, \\"and that was it,\\" he said. The boys said they had left their island with enough coconuts to keep them hydrated for two days, he said. But they used a tarpaulin to catch rainwater and for shelter after their clothes disintegrated. And two weeks ago, they caught a seabird, which they ate, he said. About the same time, authorities had concluded that the teens could not have survived and declared them dead. Two weeks ago, their families and friends held a memorial service attended by 500 people, in the island chain that has a total population of 1,400, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. But their rescue came just in the nick of time. \\"They did admit to me they had started drinking salt water two days prior to us rescuing them,\\" Fredricsen said. Drinking excess amounts of saltwater can shut down one's kidneys, which can be fatal. The boys were spotted in an \\"unusual place\\" -- west of the Tokelaus, between western Samoa and Fiji, said Eric Barratt, the managing director for the Sanford seafood company, whose boat found the boys. It was dumb luck that the fishing boat came upon the boys, said Fredricsen, since its usual port of unloading and operations is in American Samoa. \\"By chance, we were going to New Zealand to unload\\" because the boat was scheduled to be pulled from the water and inspected, a quadrennial event, he said. Fredricsen called the Tokelau Islands and informed Pelesa's grandmother of his unusual catch. \\"I just told her we found her kids, and it was total hysteria,\\" Fredricsen said. \\"It was just amazing.\\" Pelesa's uncle, Lakia Kalolo, told CNN that Pelesa's grandmother broke the news to him and others. \\"You should have seen the village, you should have seen the people here,\\" he said. \\"They were happy, very happy. Everybody was crying ... We gave thanks to God.\\" Tanu Filo described a similar scene, with singing and hugging among the villagers when the good news arrived. But when Filo Filo first phoned his father from the boat, \\"he cried more than he talked,\\" his father Tanu recalled. \\"I can tell you that he's tired and all, from the way he speaks,\\" Tanu Filo said. \\"But he was so happy.\\" Fredricsen said the boys left their mark on him and his crewmates -- not only because of what they endured while lost at sea, but because of their attitudes after rescue. \\"It was just an uplifting experience to meet these young men,\\" Fredricsen said. \\"They didn't give up.\\" Tanu Filo said locals are \\"trying to plan a celebration in a Tokelean way.\\" Besides the boys, he would like the tuna boat's captain and crew to join in the celebratory eating, singing and joy. \\"I'd like to say thanks, and shake hands and celebrate ... together,\\" Tanu Filo said. \\"We want to invite them to the feast.\\" -- CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Tom Watkins contributed to this story. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Three teenagers from Tokelau Islands spent 50 days drifting in the South Pacific in a small stolen boat before being rescued.

Lay 1 to 2 pieces of opah on a plate and brush 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of melted butter or olive oil over the fish. Spread the blackening seasoning evenly over the fish. Use your fingers to rub the seasoning into the fish and set it aside while you heat the grill. Turn a gas grill to high or heat a full chimney of briquettes. Once the briquettes are hot and lightly covered in ash, dump them in the center of the grill grate. Brush a little canola or vegetable oil on the grate to prevent the fish from sticking to it. Lay the seasoned opah on the grill so it's directly over the briquettes or the hottest part of the grill. Cook the opah for 5 minutes so it blackens on the bottom. Use tongs to flip the fish over and grill it until it's cooked on the outside. The opah will be medium-rare after 3 to 5 minutes, but you could cook it 2 to 3 more minutes, if you prefer your fish well-done. If the fish is medium-rare, it will be soft and tender. Well-done fish will be completely dry, firm, and flaky. Remove the opah from the grill and serve it immediately. Blackened opah goes well with steamed rice, cabbage, or roasted vegetables. Refrigerate leftover blackened opah in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days.","completion":"This article is a recipe for making yummy blackened opah fish.

India accorded a red-carpet welcome Tuesday to the top leader of Myanmar's military junta, currently on a five-day visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties between the neighboring countries. Gen. Than Shwe received a ceremonial reception in the sandstone presidential palace in New Delhi before he drove to the shrine to India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi to pay homage. Indian president Pratibha Devisingh Patil, prime minister Manmohan Singh, members of his cabinet and several top bureaucrats greeted the junta leader as a state guest. The military ruler's trip underscored the close relationship between the two nations -- one seen as one of the world's most vibrant democracies and another despised by the West as a repressive regime. In 1951, the two countries signed what they called a \\"treaty of friendship,\\" and over the past few years, bilateral trade has soared to almost 1 billion, according to Indian officials. Several Indian companies have invested in Myanmar's energy sector. And India's main space agency has helped set up a data-processing center in Yangon for remote-sensing applications, authorities in New Delhi say. Than Shwe's visit began on Sunday with a tour of sacred Buddhist sites in eastern India. It came days after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged India and other countries in the region to push Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to comply with UN human rights resolutions and nuclear nonproliferation agreements. \\"It is critical that Burma hear from you, its neighbors,\\" she said in a speech at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting. Clinton described life in Myanmar as \\"dangerous\\" for the country's inhabitants and called upon other nations to push for democratic reforms there. \\"We would encourage India and other countries to send a clear message to Burma that it needs to change its course,\\" State Department spokesman P.J.

Question: Given the background: You may hear males \\"ribbiting,\\" producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them. and the situation: Sandra liked all creatures but loved to study frogs. Her sister Julie studied more about fish and butterflies. They both loved nature. Answer the following question: Which sister heard fewer male frogs \\"ribbiting\\"? Answer:","completion":"The sister who likely heard fewer male frogs \\"ribbiting\\" would be Julie. The background information clearly indicates that the activity of \\"ribbiting\\" is associated with male frogs. So, the person who is more likely to hear this activity frequently would be the one who spends more time studying frogs. According to the situation provided, Sandra is the one who has special interest in studying frogs. On the other hand, Julie is more interested in studying fish and butterflies. Thus, her exposure to frogs might be less compared to Sandra. Considering these factors, we can infer that Julie heard fewer male frogs \\"ribbiting\\". However, it's important to note that the interest in studying particular animals doesn't necessarily limit their exposure to others. Julie could have still encountered frog sounds during her outings, but likely not as frequently as Sandra."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both sentences convey that Monty Python is reuniting, which is the core information being communicated. However, there are slight differences in the phrasing and additional information provided. In the first sentence, \\"Monty Python to reunite for new show,\\" it suggests that the reunion is for a new show, implying that there will be fresh content or an updated format. The focus is on the purpose of the reunion, which is the new show. In the second sentence, \\"Monty Python to reunite on stage,\\" the emphasis is placed on the setting – \\"on stage.\\" It highlights the live aspect of the reunion, notifying readers that the members will be performing together in front of an audience. In summary, both sentences convey the same general idea – Monty Python reuniting – but differ in details. The first sentence provides more information about the purpose, while the second sentence emphasizes the setting (performing on stage). The slight difference in information lowers the rating to 4, but since the overall meaning is quite similar, it's still a high similarity score."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2009, Europe felt the full brunt of the global economic crisis.

Translate to Romanian","completion":"În 2009, Europa a simțit impactul puternic al crizei economice globale. Cu siguranță, efectele acestei perioade nu ar fi putut fi mai dăunătoare pentru nivelul sărăciei din întreaga UE, mai ales pentru cei 17% dintre europeni care trăiau sub limita sărăciei în 2008. În urma crizei, economiile multor țări europene au fost profund destabilizate, ceea ce a dus la o creștere a nivelului sărăciei și la numeroase provocări economice și sociale. În această perioadă nefastă, toate statele membre ale UE au fost obligate să ia decizii dificile și să își reconsidere propriile politici economice și de creștere. Problema sărăciei în Europa în această perioadă poate fi atribuită în mare parte repercusiunilor crizei economice care a afectat întreaga lume. Unul dintre factorii principali care au alimentat această criză a fost prăbușirea pieței imobiliare din Statele Unite, care a dus, de asemenea, la o criză financiară globală. Instituțiile financiare europene, prin expunerea lor la active toxice și la riscuri semnificative, au fost puternic afectate, ceea ce a dus la o diminuare a investițiilor și la o creștere a șomajului în Europa. De asemenea, această criză economică a avut un impact negativ asupra nivelului de trai și al bunăstării sociale în Europa. Din cauza reducerii puterii de cumpărare a famililor și creșterii ratei inflației, multe gospodării au întâmpinat probleme și mai mari în îndeplinirea nevoilor de bază. Drept urmare, statele membre UE au fost nevoite să ia măsuri pentru a contracara efectele crizei și a îmbunătăți calitatea vieții cetățenilor lor. De exemplu, guvernele au implementat politici și programe de austeritate în încercarea de a echilibra bugetele naționale și de a reduce povara datoriilor publice. Aceasta a însemnat, adesea, tăierea cheltuielilor pentru sănătate, educație și asigurări sociale, ceea ce a dus inevitabil la un declin al nivelului de trai pentru anumite categorii sociale. Cu toate acestea, în timp, unele guverne au început să recupereze și să încerce să facă față provocărilor cauzate de criza economică, revizuind prioritățile lor economice și adoptând măsuri orientate spre o redresare durabilă și o creștere incluzivă. Inițiative precum Fondul Social European sau Strategia Europa 2020 au fost dezvoltate pentru a răspunde la problemele sociale și economice, promovând ocuparea forței de muncă, garantând mai multe oportunități pentru tineri și abordând excluziunea socială. În concluzie, criza economică globală din 2009 a avut un impact devastator asupra nivelului sărăciei în Europa, în special pentru cei care trăiau deja în condiții precare înainte de criză. În acest context, statele membre UE și-au ajustat politicile economice și sociale pentru a face față provocărilor pe termen lung și a reduce efectele adâncite ale acestei crize asupra cetățenilor lor. Chiar dacă situația sărăciei în Europa a început să se îmbunătățească, eforturile continue sunt necesare pentru a asigura un viitor economic și social durabil pentru toți europenii."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who is unimpressed by a magic trick?

Definition: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Input: He is credited with helping achieve economic growth and peace after the devastation caused by the Khmer Rouge regime, responsible for one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century. But the prime minister, 65, is also seen as an authoritarian figure with a poor human rights record and the resources and will to thwart any real political challenge. He shows no signs of wanting to relinquish power - in June 2018, he vowed to rule for 10 more years. His ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) has dominated Cambodia for decades, but has faced competitive elections. However the party goes into the July 2018 elections facing no significant rivals after the main opposition - the Cambodia National Rescue Party - was dissolved. Political deals Born into a peasant family in 1952, Hun Sen was educated by Buddhist monks in Phnom Penh. In the late 1960s, he joined the Communist Party. He lost his left eye during an exchange of gunfire and he has reportedly said he can only see a limited distance. During Pol Pot's tyrannical regime in the late 1970s, under which as many as two million people died, Hun Sen commanded troops in the Khmer Rouge - although he denies accusations of complicity in the regime's crimes. In 1977 he fled to Vietnam to join troops opposed to the Khmer Rouge. When Vietnam installed a new government in Cambodia in 1979, he returned as minister of foreign affairs, becoming prime minister in 1985 at the age of 33. Hun Sen lost the 1993 elections, but he refused to accept the results and forced a negotiation to become second prime minister alongside the Funcinpec Party's Prince Norodom Ranariddh. He went on to seize power in a bloody coup in 1997, forcing Prince Ranariddh to temporarily leave the country. The CPP won general elections in 2003 but did not have a two-thirds majority, so it struck a deal with Funcinpec in 2004, ending almost a year of political deadlock. Hun Sen was re-elected prime minister by parliament in July 2004. Warnings of war In Cambodia's 2008 elections the CPP won most of the contested seats. But the polls were criticised by international monitors, with the EU saying the ruling party made \\"consistent and widespread\\" use of state resources for its own campaign. Hun Sen takes credit for Cambodia's rapid economic growth and a booming garment sector that manufactures clothes for global brands. He also regularly warns Cambodians that if he were to be ousted from power, the country would return to a state of war. He focused on this theme in the lead-up to the 2013 election, after two major opposition parties joined forces, presenting a united threat to the CPP. The party they formed, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, was led by Sam Rainsy, a former Funcinpec minister who has long been Hun Sen's chief rival. Ahead of the vote, Hun Sen faced calls from the US to allow Mr Rainsy to return from exile. He had been living in France after being jailed in absentia in 2010 on charges he said were politically motivated. Eventually Hun Sen relented. Mr Rainsy was granted a royal pardon and arrived in Phnom Penh to a hero's welcome from thousands of cheering supporters who lined the streets. A major challenge The CNRP picked up momentum and won 55 National Assembly seats to the CPP's 68 in the 2013 election - the worst result for the CPP in many years. Mr Rainsy and the CNRP - supported by reports of widespread irregularities from local and international election monitors - cried foul and rejected the results. They led a protest movement for nearly a year, including mass street rallies and a large sit-in at a park in Phnom Penh. It was the most significant challenge to Hun Sen's rule in more than a decade, and eventually he ordered the security forces to end the protests. He and Mr Rainsy reached a deal to work together under a \\"culture of dialogue\\" but this eventually broke down, with opposition party members and activists jailed. Sam Rainsy again fled abroad after a historic prison sentence was resurrected. In 2016, a government crackdown against perceived dissidents escalated, ahead of local elections in 2017. In July, a prominent political analyst and government critic, Kem Ley, was assassinated in broad daylight, supposedly over a debt dispute. Removing opposition After the opposition performed well in the 2017 commune council elections, Hun Sen and the CPP moved definitively against the CNRP. In September, Kem Sokha, the new leader, was arrested on treason charges and several other senior politicians fled into exile. Two months later, the Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP completely, paving the way for national elections in 2018 that have been rejected as illegitimate by the EU and US government. Hun Sen is facing calls for sanctions against his inner circle, but appears to be pushing ahead to consolidate control. Analysts say he is grooming his three sons - all of whom are in powerful positions either in the party, military or government - to take the reins when he eventually steps down. But no one knows when that might be. Output:","completion":"Hun Sen, Cambodia's long-serving prime minister, has maintained power through authoritarian measures and the elimination of significant political opposition, despite contributions to economic growth and a lull in the ongoing war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: what is the main purpose of the league of nations?","completion":"The main purpose of the League of Nations was to maintain international peace and security, promote cooperation among nations, and prevent the outbreak of another large-scale conflict like the devastating World War I, which preceded its establishment. Essentially, the League of Nations was the first international organization aimed at fostering diplomacy and dialogue, in an effort to prevent the escalation of disputes and preserve peace among nations. The League of Nations was established in January 1920 as a result of the Paris Peace Conference, following the end of World War I. It was the brainchild of then-U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who detailed the vision for the organization in his famous \\"Fourteen Points\\" speech in 1918. Although the United States did not ultimately become a member of the League of Nations due to political disagreements, its ideals and objectives were crucial in shaping the structure and goals of the organization. The primary objectives of the League of Nations can be outlined as follows: 1. Maintain World Peace: The main goal of the League was to keep peace through diplomatic negotiations, especially through arbitration and the principle of collective security. Its Covenant, or constitution, envisioned an international community that would abandon the use of force and war to resolve conflicts, and instead find peaceful solutions to their disagreements. 2. Prevent Aggression: The League aimed to deter aggression by establishing mechanisms to deal with non-compliant and belligerent nations. This included economic sanctions, boycotts, or even the use of military force in extreme cases, although the latter was rarely applied in practice. 3. Disarmament: Recognizing that nations' stockpiling of weapons and military resources led to a heightened risk of war, the League sought to promote disarmament by encouraging countries to limit their armed forces and armaments. By doing so, this would reduce the probability of another all-out conflict and increase the prospects of peaceful diplomacy. 4. Settlement of International Disputes: The League promoted the resolution of disputes through negotiation and discussion. It played the role of mediator and provided a legal framework for peaceful arbitration. If member nations were unable to arrive at a mutually-acceptable resolution, they could refer their dispute to the League's Council or Assembly, where it would be discussed, and potential solutions would be devised. 5. Encouraging Cooperation: To promote peaceful coexistence, the League encouraged international cooperation in various aspects, including trade, healthcare, labor rights, refugees, and social welfare. This cooperation led to the establishment of functional organizations, such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) and World Health Organization (WHO), that continue to work under the auspices of the United Nations today. 6. Protection of Minorities: One of the League's objectives was to safeguard the rights of minority groups in countries where they were vulnerable to discrimination and mistreatment. The League aimed to ensure that all people, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or religion, could enjoy their inherent rights. Despite its noble objectives, the League of Nations ultimately proved to be ineffective, as it lacked the authority, resources, and enforcement mechanisms necessary to fulfill its mission. It faced numerous shortcomings and its inability to prevent World War II is often cited as evidence of its failure. However, many of its principles, ideas, and lessons learned served as the foundation for the creation of the United Nations (UN) in 1945, which continues to work towards similar goals with a more developed structure and enhanced legitimacy among the international community. The legacy of the League of Nations illustrates that achieving lasting peace and diplomacy between nations is a challenging but critical mission for the global community."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: More than a third of the babies born this year could receive a 100th birthday message from whoever happens to be on the throne in the second decade of the 22nd century, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the quartet that wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal? Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it.

The initial shock and feelings of disbelief quickly evolved into a collective effort to provide support and care to the victims, their families, and the community at large. Various organizations, both within Killeen and throughout the country, offered their support, and the town emerged as an example of how a community can come together after such a harrowing incident. In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, local law enforcement agencies, emergency services, and volunteers came together to help with rescue and recovery efforts. Mental health professionals were provided to help those affected cope with the emotional trauma, and a temporary crisis center was established to deal with the practical needs of victims and their families. Prayer services and memorial events were held to honor the victims and provide solace for the bereaved. The people of Killeen also looked for ways to change policies and laws to prevent such tragedies from happening again. Some survivors and families of the victims became advocates for gun control reform and pushed for legislative changes. As a direct result of the Luby's massacre, the Texas Legislature enacted legislation allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons, with the hope that armed citizens may be able to prevent future mass shootings. Furthermore, there was a nationwide call for increased gun control measures, including the improvement of background checks and restrictions on certain types of firearms, along with a focus on mental health care to identify and support those who may be vulnerable to violent acts. Community outreach and support networks were strengthened in Killeen as well, with programs targeting mental health issues and resources dedicated to helping those in need. This included increased funding for counseling services, the establishment of hotlines for those in crisis, and more comprehensive outreach to ensure that those affected knew where to turn for assistance. Schools, churches, and other community organizations all played a role in addressing the issues that had contributed to this horrific event, and their actions demonstrated a commitment to fostering a safer, more supportive environment for all residents. The lasting effects of the Luby's massacre can still be felt in Killeen today, not just in the memories of those who were touched directly by the tragedy, but in the ongoing efforts to ensure that their community remains a place defined by its strength, resilience, and unity in the face of adversity. The incident served as a catalyst for change, both in the local community and in the way the United States approached the problem of mass shootings and the need for gun control reform. In the years since the Luby's tragedy, the community has continued to draw on their experience to support and assist other communities affected by similar events. By sharing their stories and the lessons they learned, they have helped to create a network of support and resilience that stretches across the nation, fostering empathy and solidarity in the face of such violence. While the tragedy at Luby's cafeteria will never be forgotten, the response of the Killeen community is a testament to the power of collective action, the strength of the human spirit, and the resilience of those who choose to stand together and confront adversity. Through their inspiring actions, the people of Killeen have turned their darkest moment into a shining example of hope and perseverance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter Alvin Wilby, vice-president of research at French defence giant Thales, which supplies reconnaissance drones to the British Army, said the \\"genie is out of the bottle\\" with smart technology. And he raised the prospect of attacks by \\"swarms\\" of small drones that move around and select targets with only limited input from humans. \\"The technological challenge of scaling it up to swarms and things like that doesn't need any inventive step,\\" he told the Lords Artificial Intelligence committee. \\"It's just a question of time and scale and I think that's an absolute certainty that we should worry about.\\" The US and Chinese military are testing swarming drones - dozens of cheap unmanned aircraft that can be used to overwhelm enemy targets or defend humans from attack. Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at University of Sheffield, said he feared \\"very bad copies\\" of such weapons - without safeguards built-in to prevent indiscriminate killing - would fall into the hands of terrorist groups such as so-called Islamic State. This was as big a concern as \\"authoritarian dictators getting a hold of these, who won't be held back by their soldiers not wanting to kill the population,\\" he told the Lords Artificial Intelligence committee. He said IS was already using drones as offensive weapons, although they were currently remote-controlled by human operators. But the \\"arms race\\" in battlefield artificial intelligence meant smart drones and other systems that roamed around firing at will could soon be a reality. \\"I don't want to live in a world where war can happen in a few seconds accidentally and a lot of people die before anybody stops it\\", said Prof Sharkey, who is a spokesman for the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. The only way to prevent this new arms race, he argued, was to \\"put new international restraints on it\\", something he was promoting at the United Nations as a member of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control. But Prof Wilby, whose company markets technology to combat drone attacks, said such a ban would be \\"misguided\\" and difficult to enforce. He said there was already an international law of armed conflict, which was designed to ensure armed forces \\"use the minimum force necessary to achieve your objective, while creating the minimum risk of unintended consequences, civilian losses\\". The Lords committee, which is investigating the impact of artificial intelligence on business and society, was told that developments in AI were being driven by the private sector, in contrast to previous eras, when the military led the way in cutting edge technology. And this meant that it was more difficult to stop it falling into the wrong hands. Britain's armed forces do not use AI in offensive weapons, the committee was told, and the Ministry of Defence has said it has no intention of developing fully autonomous systems. But critics, such as Prof Sharkey, say the UK needs to spell out its commitment to banning AI weapons in law.","completion":"\\"Dangers of Swarming Drones and AI in Warfare\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Debates Over, the Final Decision Awaits Re “Obama and Romney Bristle From Start Over Foreign Policy” (front page, Oct. 23): For the final debate, Mitt Romney appeared in a new role of practically a cheerleader for President Obama. He agreed on almost everything and applauded Mr. Obama for many foreign policy achievements. The question is, Can we trust this cheerleader, whose advisers include a good number of neoconservatives? Is he not a wolf in sheep’s clothing? And if Mr. Obama’s policies are so good, why would we want to replace him with Mr. Romney? ALEXANDER SOIFER Colorado Springs, Oct. 23, 2012 Mitt Romney held his own, and more, in the debate with President Obama regarding foreign policy and the need for a strong economy and military to resolve America’s failing leadership in the world. He did not stoop to childish jabs as the president did, nor did he embarrass the president over his deadly failure to protect his ambassador and three other Americans from a terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. Mr. Romney demonstrated a presidential command of the knowledge, concern and solutions needed, while President Obama poses the threat of American military and economic weakness. DANIEL B. JEFFS Apple Valley, Calif., Oct. 23, 2012 It looked to me as if this last presidential debate was the exact opposite of the first debate. This time it looked as if Mitt Romney was asleep. The debate was officially about foreign policy, which is where Mr. Romney is weak. President Obama kept hitting Mr. Romney on contradictions, and Mr. Romney failed to respond. Mr. Romney also had a last chance to finally reveal the specifics of his plans for the economy, and he failed to do so. MARC PERKEL Gilroy, Calif., Oct. 23, 2012 The core idea in “The Opiate of Exceptionalism” (news analysis, Sunday Review, Oct. 21) was corroborated by the presidential debate on foreign policy. Americans need, and want, to continue to believe that they are an “exceptional” nation, a special people. If there was one thing both presidential candidates agreed on, it was that America has to lead, has to expand its influence worldwide, as well as exert its will, for achieving a better world. Mitt Romney was more adamant in this respect, with his Hollywood-style belief that America should take up the mantle of world leadership, and be honored to do so. Yet President Obama seemed to be on the same page. Sadly, it all sounds like a 21st-century version of the 19th-century British imperialist and supremacist rhetoric. ANDREA CHIOVENDA Jalalabad, Afghanistan, Oct. 23, 2012 The writer, a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology at Boston University, is conducting ethnographic fieldwork in Afghanistan. In “Presidential Mitt” (column, Oct. 21), Bill Keller wrote that if Mitt Romney is elected, “he will be hostage to the same far-right forces he kowtowed to in the primaries.” That, in a nutshell, is a central concern of many. Undoubtedly Mr. Romney has learned the lessons from the first President Bush not to renege on the principles and promises that helped him secure the nomination (“read my lips ...”). Equally likely, if elected he will try mightily to prove his conservative bona fides to the Republican base. Any such strategy will be a surefire prescription to repeat some of the disastrous and wrongheaded policies of the second President Bush. LEE A. SPIELMANN New York, Oct. 23, 2012 This season’s debates proved one thing: the format is outmoded and this TV show should be canceled. Changing moderators is just a cast change. The actors have learned their lines and studied their roles. The lost live TV news conference should be reinstated and required for the next presidential election season. FRANCIS W. RODGERS Washington, Oct. 23, 2012 Regarding “Would You Please Let Me Finish...,” by Deborah Tannen (Op-Ed, Oct. 18): When interrupted, I use my favorite retort: “Pardon me for speaking while you are interrupting.” WILLIAM ZEPH GINSBERG New York, Oct. 18, 2012","completion":"The final presidential debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney had contrasting opinions and showcased Mitt Romney's support for Obama's foreign policy achievements. Debating over foreign policy, both candidates expressed their views on America's military and economic strength. While Romney appeared as a somewhat cheerleader for Obama, agreeing with almost everything he said, some questioned if Romney's intentions may not be entirely genuine considering that his advisers include a number of neoconservatives. This raised concerns about replacing President Obama with Romney. In the debate, Romney demonstrated presidential command and knowledge of the subject matter, while President Obama focused on pointing out Romney's contradictions. Both candidates agreed on the importance of America's global leadership and expanding its influence worldwide. However, this stance has been referred to as a modern interpretation of 19th-century British imperialism. The overall analysis of the debate concludes that Romney wants to secure the nomination, while Obama is aware of Romney's conservative principles. Some argue that the format of the debates is outdated and should be changed or canceled altogether."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Passage: Several archaeological finds on the territory of Woluwe-Saint-Lambert show traces of human activity during the Bronze Age. The first historical mention of the village, however, dates from the 11th century, when some of the forested land near the Woluwe River was cleared for farming. A church was built and dedicated to Saint Lambert, the 7th-century bishop of Maastricht who was martyred in Liège. At the end of the 12th century, the rights to the parish of Saint Lambert were given to the canons of the chapter of St. Michael and Gudula in Brussels. Various charitable organizations and hospitals then started acquiring land in this area. Throughout the Middle Ages, Woluwe was part of the Duchy of Brabant, governed under the usual feudal arrangement of those times. Among the Dukes' vassals were some powerful local lords and landowners. Some of Woluwe's territory also belonged to the powerful Forest Abbey (Vorst in Dutch) and Park Abbey.

However, it is essential to understand that this answer is part of a broader context and several other tasks or steps Adrian may need to have completed or considered before reaching this stage. Adrian's preparation for applying to a nursing school and asking someone for a recommendation letter may include various steps, such as: 1. Researching potential nursing schools and programs: Before jumping into the application process, it is crucial for Adrian to carefully research and identify the schools and programs they are interested in. This will help to understand each program's requirements, deadlines, and application process. 2. Completing the nursing prerequisites: As initially mentioned, the completion of required prerequisite courses according to the specific program or school's requirements is a vital step. These prerequisites may include subjects such as Anatomy, Physiology, Microbiology, Chemistry, and others depending on the program. 3. Gaining relevant healthcare experience: Since nursing programs are generally competitive, gaining experience in the healthcare field – such as volunteering, internships, or working part-time – may help strengthen Adrian's application and give them a better idea of what to expect in nursing school. 4. Preparing a strong personal statement: Crafting a well-written, engaging personal statement that reflects Adrian's passion, career goals, and experience is an essential part of the application process. This document should exhibit their motivation, skills, and work ethic for pursuing a career in nursing. 5. Identifying suitable recommenders: Before asking Lee for a recommendation letter, Adrian should consider the type of references required and identify people who can vouch for their academic, professional, and personal qualifications. These recommenders should have closely worked with Adrian, be familiar with their strengths, and be capable of writing a strong, personalized recommendation letter. 6. Requesting the recommendation letter: Once preparing their application materials, Adrian should formally request recommendation letters from their chosen recommenders, such as Lee. They should provide sufficient notice before the deadline and share their academic and professional achievements to assist in composing a well-rounded letter. 7.

She covered the walls with elegant white and pink drapes, which settled next to shiny, golden accents. The tables were dressed in luxurious tablecloths, complete with sparkling sequin runners and vintage-style dinnerware. Custom-designed centerpieces featuring Amayah as the princess took center stage on each table, surrounded by magical fairy dust and twinkling candlelight. No detail was overlooked in creating a delightful ambiance that made every guest feel like royalty. Not forgetting the essentials for any successful party, Amayah's princess-themed party came complete with delicious treats and entertaining games. A majestic cake stood tall on a pedestal, adorned with cascading flowers and a beautiful topper of Princess Amayah. Surrounding the dessert table were scrumptious bite-sized snacks that each guest could enjoy, including dainty sandwiches, assorted pastries, and delicate macarons. One of the highlights of the party was a magical tea station. Amayah's mom arranged a row of fine bone china teacups and saucers for the children to use during the tea party. The guests could choose from an array of flavored teas, all of which bore enchanting names such as Unicorn Dream, Fairy Berry, and Mermaid Treasure, as well as classic options like Earl Grey or English Breakfast. Each tea was accompanied by a selection of milk, honey, and sugar, allowing each child to craft their perfect cup of tea. The party games were just as thrilling.

We want to find the value of 'k', so let's get 'k' by itself by moving '151' to the other side: 8*k = 111 - 151 4. Now, let's do the subtraction: 8*k = -40 5. Finally, let's find the value of 'k' by dividing both sides by '8': k = -40 / 8 6. The last step, do the division: k = -5 So the solution for the math problem is k = -5.

Context: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...

Esta frase proviene del Salmo 79:6 en la Biblia y es un llamado de justicia a Dios por parte de su pueblo. En este versículo, se pide a Dios que muestre su justicia castigando a los que no lo han reconocido como su creador y no han buscado su guía ni su nombre. La ira y el castigo en este contexto tienen connotaciones religiosas y espirituales, ya que se refiere a las consecuencias divinas de negar a Dios y no seguir sus enseñanzas. La oración en español conserva el significado de la frase original en inglés, manteniendo la esencia religiosa y espiritual que se encuentra en el Salmo. Los \\"paganos\\" y los \\"reinos\\" representan a las personas y naciones que no han puesto su fe en Dios y han seguido otros caminos que han llevado a su separación de él. Esta súplica forma parte del sistema de creencias judeocristiano, en el cual Dios es el creador del universo y el ser supremo que imparte justicia y cuida a su pueblo. La frase en español también refleja la importancia del lenguaje y su impacto en la comprensión de conceptos religiosos y espirituales en diferentes culturas y contextos. En este caso, la traducción al español permite que un hablante nativo de este idioma entienda el mensaje y la enseñanza del versículo bíblico de una manera más clara. A lo largo de la historia, diferentes naciones y grupos religiosos han interpretado estos versículos y pasajes bíblicos de acuerdo a sus propias creencias y circunstancias, y esto sigue siendo cierto hoy en día. Mientras que algunos pueden ver esta súplica como una expresión de justicia divina y un deseo de que aquellos que no siguen a Dios enfrenten las consecuencias de sus acciones, otros pueden interpretarlo como una oportunidad para extender la enseñanza religiosa y ofrecer la salvación a aquellos que no han tenido aún la oportunidad de conocer a Dios. En conclusión, la frase “Derrama tu ira sobre los paganos que no te han conocido, y sobre los reinos que no han invocado tu nombre” en español conserva el mensaje y la importancia religiosa del Salmo 79:6 original en inglés. Esta expresión destaca la necesidad de conocer y seguir a Dios, así como las consecuencias espirituales de no hacerlo, y forma parte del conjunto de enseñanzas y creencias presentes en las tradiciones judeocristianas."},{"prompt":"Q: You will be given a context, a subject and a relation.

The study also found a relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim, with a total admixture estimate similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What piece did Bizet play the piano version of for a select audience? is inside the article: As life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director, Émile Perrin. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director's unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer's opera Erostrate after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on Clarissa Harlowe and Grisélidis, but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled Jeux d'enfants, and a one-act opera, Djamileh, which opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Geneviève gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques. Bizet's next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872–73, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at the Opéra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: \\"You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you\\".In June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: \\"I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra-Comique. [Henri] Meilhac and [Ludovic]..., can you guess it ?

He enters the front door to find his roommate, Brandon, sitting on the couch playing videogames and eating potato chips. Phillip tells Brandon that if he keeps being so lazy and snacking so much he's going to start looking chubby. Brandon just waves Phillip off and goes back to his game. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Are Brandon's cardiac muscles increasing or decreasing in strength? Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be assumed that Brandon's cardiac muscles are decreasing in strength. This is because he is being sedentary (sitting on the couch playing video games and eating potato chips) instead of engaging in physical activities such as running or weight lifting that would increase the strength and efficiency of his cardiac muscles. It is important to regularly exercise in order to maintain and improve muscle strength, including cardiac muscles.

Jordan says it has carried out 56 airstrikes on Islamic State targets in revenge for the murder of Jordanian pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh. The country's air force chief said the three consecutive days of attacks were 'just the beginning' of campaigns planned in a bid to avenge the 26-year-old's death. Last week, ISIS released a video purporting to show Kasasbeh being burnt alive in a cage as masked militants in camouflage uniforms looked on. Scroll down for video. Airstrike: Jordan has carried out 56 aerial bombings on Islamic State targets in revenge for the murder of Jordanian pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh. Pictured: Aerial strike from video released last week by officials. Tribute: A plane belonging to the Jordanian Royal Air Force made a deliberate diversion over over the home town of the pilot brutally murdered by ISIS after carrying out airstrikes against the terror group in Syria. Major General Mansour al-Jabour (pictured) said: 'We achieved what we were looking for: revenge for Muath' The act has been widely condemned as among the most sickening ever committed to film and sent waves of revulsion across the Middle East. Today, Major General Mansour al-Jabour said: 'We achieved what we were looking for: revenge for Muath. And this is not the end. This is the beginning.' According to Major General, the strikes - dubbed Operation Martyr Moaz in the pilot's memory - targeted ISIS's weapon depots, training centres, warehouses and military barracks. Jordanian military experts say the kingdom could soon struggle to sustain the intensity of the past few days of air strikes, given the air force only has 40 mid-life F16 jets at its disposal. A squadron of F16 jet fighters from the United Arab Emirates arrived in Jordan on Sunday a day after the Gulf state announced it was being sent to bolster the coalition's military effort. A squadron of United Arab Emirates F-16 fighters has arrived in one of Jordan's air bases to support it in strikes against the Islamic State group. Brutal: ISIS released footage purportedly showing the 26-year-old pilot being burned to death in a cage. Major General Mansour al-Jabour said the strike had 'achieved what we were looking for: revenge for Muath' Looking for revenge: King Abdullah (pictured today with Prince Charles) had vowed to wage a 'harsh' war against ISIS militants who control parts of neighboring Syria and Iraq. It will conduct joint air strikes with Jordanian colleagues against the Islamic militants, Jordanian officials said on Saturday. The focus of Jordan's airstrikes are reported to be Raqqa, the ISIS stronghold in Syria. The intensified air assaults come almost one week after the extremists released the chilling footage, which sparked protests throughout Jordan. Entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', the 22-minute film showed the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and being seemingly doused in fuel, as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars of the cage is set alight. Officials believe Kasasbeh had been killed almost one month earlier, despite ISIS attempting to carry out a prisoner exchange in return for the stricken pilot. After the footage was released, Jordanian officials promised to retaliate harshly and quickly executed two Iraqi militants connected with ISIS. This included Sajida al-Rishawi, the female would-be suicide bomber whose freedom ISIS had originally demanded in exchange for releasing Kasasbeh. King Abdullah II later said Jordan's response would 'be harsh because this terrorist organisation is not only fighting us, but also fighting Islam and its pure values.' In a statement, he pledged to hit the militants 'hard in the very centre of their strongholds'. Days later, the country released a slickly-edited video showing its war planes being prepared for bombing strikes against ISIS jihadists in Syria. Jordan released a video last week showing its war planes being prepared for bombing strikes against ISIS. The video also featured a pilot holding up a sign that reads: 'And do not think that God is unaware of what the evildoers are doing' - an apparent warning to ISIS militants. The footage, believed to have been broadcast on state TV, was understood to have been recorded at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base and showed troops on plane-mounted missiles before the fleet of fighter jets are launched. The clip shows uniformed people, believed to be members of the Jordanian military, writing messages in Arabic across plane-mounted missiles. One reads 'for you, the enemy of Islam'. ISIS seized control of large areas of Iraq and Syria last year, prompting hundreds of raids by coalition war planes. The United States and several Arab allies, including Jordan, have been striking ISIS in Syria since September 23. Warplanes from the U.S. and other countries have been waging an air campaign against the extremists in Iraq for even longer. The campaign aims to push back the jihadi organisation after it took large parts of Iraq and Syria and declared a 'caliphate.' Al-Jabour said coalition planes have flown 5,500 sorties since the beginning of the air campaign, including 2,000 reconnaissance flights. He did not say whether this included flights over both Syria and Iraq. He said Jordan's air force participated in 946 sorties. The general said about 7,000 Islamic State group militants have been killed since the beginning of the coalition airstrikes.

Q: Passage: Bellinger started in left field in his major league debut on April 25, 2017, against the San Francisco Giants, and had one hit in three at-bats, with an intentional walk. He was just the third Dodgers player in history to be intentionally walked in his debut (Chico Fernández, Dick Nen). Bellinger's first major league hit was an infield single off Neil Ramírez in the ninth inning of the same game. Bellinger hit his first major league home run on April 29 off Zach Eflin of the Philadelphia Phillies and followed that by hitting a second home run in the same game, this one off Héctor Neris. He was just the third Dodgers player with a two–home-run game among his first five starts, joining Charlie Gilbert (1940) and Yasiel Puig (2013). He hit his first grand slam on May 6, off Miguel Díaz of the San Diego Padres, as part of a career-high five RBI day. He was the first Dodgers player to hit five home runs within his first 11 games. Bellinger was named the National League Player of the Week for the first week of May.

Answer the following question: Information: - Virarajendra Chola (10631070 CE) was one of the most underrated Chola kings, mainly because a major part of his life was spent as a subordinate of his two elder brothers Rajadhiraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola II, who along with Virarajendra Chola himself were the illustrious sons of their Chakravarti(Emperor) father, Rajendra Chola I. While certainly it was not a practice among the Chola kings to nominate the eldest son, but the most capable (in administration of their domains as well as proving their mettle on the battlefield) as the heir to the throne. During his early reign he granted the maintenance of a school to study the Vedas, Sastras and Grammar and a hostel was provided for the students. A hospital named Virasolan was also provided by him for the sick people. The famous grammatical work in Tamil, Virasoliyam was written by Buddhamitra during his reign. - Rajendra Chola II reigned as the Chola king succeeding his elder brother Rajadhiraja Chola in the 11th century. He is best remembered for his role in the battle of Koppam along with his elder brother where he dramatically turned the tables on the Chalukyan King Someshvara I, after the death of his brother in 1052. During his early reign an expedition was led to Sri Lanka, in the course of which the Sri Lanka army was routed and their king Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa was driven to take refuge in a mountain-fortress. He maintained the Chola Empire well as the distribution of his records show that the Chola Empire did not suffer any loss of territory during his reign. - Rajendra Chola I or Rajendra I was a Chola emperor who is considered one of the greatest rulers and military generals of India. He succeeded his father Rajaraja Chola I in 1014 CE. During his reign, he extended the influence of the Chola empire to the banks of the river Ganga in North India and across the Indian ocean to the West, making the Chola Empire one of the most powerful empires of India. Rajendras conquests included the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and he successfully invaded and raided the territories of Srivijaya in Malaysia, Southern Thailand and Indonesia in South East Asia. The Cholas exacted tribute from Thailand and the Khmer kingdom of Cambodia. He defeated Mahipala, the Pala king of Bengal and Bihar, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital city called Gangaikonda Cholapuram. - Kpparaksarivarman Rjdhiraja Chla I was an 11th-century emperor of the Indian Chola empire and the successor of his father, Rajendra Chola I. During his long reign, he helped his father conquer many territories and maintained the Chola authority over most of Lanka, Vengi, Kalinga, etc. and the relations with overseas domains despite a series of revolts in the territory. Rajadhiraja Cholas record shows that he was a born fighter who was very capable of maintaining a vast and expansive empire with territories even outside the shores of India. He was a great warrior who always led from the front. His life is a testimony to a king who fought his own wars standing shoulder to shoulder with his men on front lines. He performed the horse sacrifice and earned the title \\"Jayamkonda Cholan\\" (The Victorious Cholan). He was also known as \\"Vijaya Rajendra Cholan\\" (the victorious Rajendra Cholan). One of his predecessors, Rajaraja Chola I also assumed the title Jayangonda Chola towards the \\"end\\" of his reign. - Athirajendra Chola ( 1070 CE ) reigned for a very short period of few months as the Chola king succeeding his father Virarajendra Chola . His reign was marked by civil unrest , possibly religious in nature , in which he was killed . The Chalukya Chola prince Rajiga succeeded him as Kulothunga Chola I.

Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) is the public radio and TV broadcaster of Albania, founded by King Zog in 1938. RTSH runs three analogue television stations as TVSH Televizioni Shqiptar, four digital thematic stations as RTSH, and three radio stations using the name Radio Tirana. In addition, 4 regional radio stations serve in the four extremities of Albania. The international service broadcasts radio programmes in Albanian and seven other languages via medium wave (AM) and short wave (SW). The international service has used the theme from the song \\"Keputa nje gjethe dafine\\" as its signature tune. The international television service via satellite was launched since 1993 and aims at Albanian communities in Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and northern Greece, plus the Albanian diaspora in the rest of Europe. RTSH has a past of being heavily influenced by the ruling party in its reporting, whether that party be left or right wing. According to the Albanian Media Authority, AMA, Albania has an estimated 257 media outlets, including 66 radio stations and 67 television stations, with three national, 62 local and more than 50 cable TV stations.

Rainier National Park late last week as Karen Sykes, a prominent local hiker and journalist. Sykes, 70, of Seattle, had been missing for three days when a search for her was suspended Saturday afternoon after the discovery of a body. The cause of her death, which was ruled an accident, was hypothermia, the Pierce County Medical Examiner’s Office told the Los Angeles Times. Coroner's officials said arteriosclerotic vascular disease, a type of hardening of the arteries, was a contributing factor. Her boyfriend and hiking partner, Robert Morthorst, declined to comment. Sykes and Morthorst were on the Owyhigh Lakes Trail on Wednesday night when they found that melting snow had cut off their path, according to a news release from the park. Sykes went ahead but Morthorst believed the snow made hiking the eight-mile trail too difficult and stayed behind, a park spokeswoman said. “Ms. Sykes is a very strong hiker and she wanted to go ahead, and her hiking partner had chosen not to hike on the snow, so they agreed to meet each other back at the same point,” said spokeswoman Mimi Gorman, when crews were still searching. Morthorst reported Sykes missing about 10:45 p.m. Wednesday. Park officials later said she was carrying enough survival gear for one night. Her death comes less than a month after six climbers trying to reach Mt. Rainier's summit disappeared in late May. All are presumed dead. Park officials suspended efforts to recover their bodies in the treacherous terrain.

Crews searched Mount Rainier National Park on Friday, June 20, 2014, for Sykes, an outdoors writer, was reported missing late Wednesday while... (Associated Press) SEATTLE (AP) — A 70-year-old hiker who died of hypothermia in rugged terrain in Mount Rainier National Park over the weekend was experienced, prepared and knew the mountain well after having written dozens of stories about treks through the area. She did not have other injuries and her death was an accident, the Pierce County medical examiner's office said Monday. Sykes had heart disease, according to an autopsy, but her daughter and others said she was healthy and fit and often hiked twice a week. While not certain about the circumstances around her death, those who knew Karen Sykes said earlier that they believe her death was something that could happen to anyone no matter how experienced. \\"The mountains are big. There's a lot going on. She was extremely experienced but experience has nothing to do with any of it,\\" said Kim Brown, who has hiked with Sykes. \\"She was very careful, very cautious,\\" Brown said of Sykes, who was prominent in the Northwest hiking community for her trail reviews and photographs and her book on hiking western Washington. \\"It's just something that happens out in the mountains. Everybody who goes in the mountains knows this can happen. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't go out, you need to be aware of it.\\" Sykes was reported missing late Wednesday when she failed to meet up with her boyfriend as planned during a day hike in the east side of the mountain. Park officials suspended three-day search efforts on Saturday when they discovered Sykes. Kindra Ramos, with the nonprofit Washington Trails Association, said she won't guess what happened to Sykes but said hiking comes with some inherent risks. \\"As they go outdoors, the best thing you could do is to have your 10 essentials, be comfortable with your surroundings, and go as far as you're comfortable,\\" Ramos said. She recommended proper trip planning and preparation, including reading trip reports and knowing weather conditions. \\"Karen knew these things and I'm sure did them. She really had her bases covered, and unfortunately accidents happen sometimes,\\" Ramos said. She added that Sykes would want people to know that there are some risks but \\"she wouldn't want to scare people from hiking.\\" Mary Kay Nelson, executive director of Visit Rainier, an organization that promotes tourism at the mountain, said Sykes was researching a story that she likely would have submitted to the website. She said Sykes had written about more than 100 hikes in the Rainier area, and \\"was always eager to find new places to go, hidden hikes that weren't well-traveled.\\" Nelson said her disappearance was particularly shocking because she was so experienced. \\"It tells us that no matter how prepared we are, accidents happens and things can happen. We need to take outdoor recreation seriously. There's a certain amount of risk every day we get up, whatever we do,\\" she said. Since 2000, 18 hikers have died in Mount Rainier National Park, including from falls, drowning and heart attacks, according to park statistics. Annette Shirey, 52, who lives in Tucson, Arizona, said her mother had a personal connection to the mountain and wanted to share that love with others. \\"The mountains were always a place that gave her strength and was always uplifting for her,\\" she said. \\"It helped restore her spirit and her strength.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Karen Sykes, a 70-year-old prominent local hiker and journalist, was found dead in Mt.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the last names of the two people who were married and McCartney was the best man?, using the article: Harrison married model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966, with McCartney serving as best man. Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film A Hard Day's Night, in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl. They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977. Boyd said her decision to end the marriage was due largely to George's repeated infidelities. The last infidelity culminated in an affair with Ringo's wife Maureen, which Boyd called \\"the final straw\\". She characterised the last year of their marriage as \\"fuelled by alcohol and cocaine\\", and she stated: \\"George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart.\\" She subsequently moved in with Eric Clapton, and they married in 1979.Harrison married Dark Horse Records' secretary Olivia Trinidad Arias on 2 September 1978. They had met at the A&M Records offices in Los Angeles in 1974, and together had one son, Dhani Harrison, born on 1 August 1978.He restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, his home in Henley-on-Thames, where several of his music videos were filmed including \\"Crackerbox Palace\\"; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of All Things Must Pass. He employed ten workers to maintain the 36-acre (15 ha) garden. Harrison commented on gardening as a form of escapism: \\"Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'\\" His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated \\"to gardeners everywhere\\". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: \\"George is not disowning the Beatles ... but it was a long time ago and actually a short part of his life.\\"Harrison had an interest in sports cars and motor racing; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the McLaren F1 road car. He..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question is: The two people who were married and had McCartney as the best man were George Harrison and Pattie Boyd.

Question 1: It's not just a coincidence that most of the world's developed countries are in the Northern Hemisphere. There are many reasons, like history and geography, that have contributed to more developed countries being in the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in the past, there were lots of powerful empires in places like Europe and North America, and they grew and developed more quickly than other areas. Question 2: AMT103 Swift message is a kind of message that banks use to send money from one place to another.

U.S. corporate bond yield spreads tightened in spotty trading on Friday as Wall Street labored to get back on its feet after the largest power outage ever in North America. U.S. stocks rose slightly on feather-light volume on Friday, as Wall Street regrouped after the biggest-ever power outage in North America. Return your answer on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\".","completion":"I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as a 3 on a scale of 0 to 5. Although both sentences discuss events surrounding the largest power outage ever in North America, they focus on different aspects of that event's impact on financial markets. The first sentence primarily discusses the effect of the power outage on U.S. corporate bond yield spreads, noting that they tightened in spotty trading as Wall Street was recovering from the event. This implies that bond market activity and liquidity were somewhat impaired, resulting in these yield spread changes. The second sentence, on the other hand, highlights the impact of the power outage on the U.S. stock market. It notes that stocks rose slightly on feather-light volume, signaling that trading activity was low following the power outage. The focus here is on how the power outage affected stock prices, with an emphasis on the subdued nature of trading during the recovery period. Although both sentences mention Wall Street's efforts to get back on its feet after the power outage, they address different aspects of the financial markets (bonds versus stocks) and provide somewhat different information related to each. I would therefore classify the sentences as somewhat similar but not equivalent, which corresponds to a rating of 3 on the given scale."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: \\"because parents aren't parents\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"because kids are not being taught by their parents\\" true? Options are: a. yes. b. it is not possible to tell. c. no.","completion":"b. it is not possible to tell. The premise \\"because parents aren't parents\\" is somewhat vague and open to interpretation. It implies that there is some deficiency in the parenting role, but doesn't provide specific information about what exactly is lacking. Therefore, it's not possible to conclusively determine if the hypothesis \\"because kids are not being taught by their parents\\" is true based solely on this premise. There could be a variety of reasons why the statement \\"parents aren't parents\\" is made. It could be because some parents may not be performing traditional parenting duties such as nurturing, teaching, or guiding their children. Alternatively, it could refer to the absence of emotional support or the inability of some parents to communicate effectively with their kids. The premise might even refer to parents who outsource most of their parenting responsibilities to others, such as teachers, caregivers, or extended family members. Given the range of possible interpretations, it is not possible to determine without further context whether the hypothesis \\"kids are not being taught by their parents\\" is true. This hypothesis might be accurate in some scenarios, but not in others. For example, if the premise \\"parents aren't parents\\" refers to parents who are disengaged from their children's lives, focusing on their careers, or constantly depending on others to raise their kids, the hypothesis could be true. In this case, the children might not be receiving the necessary guidance and teaching from their parents, which could negatively affect their development. On the other hand, if the premise refers to parents who struggle with communication but still attempt to teach their children, the hypothesis might not be true. It could be that these parents are making efforts to teach their kids, but the message may not come across as effectively as they hope. In this situation, the hypothesis that \\"kids are not being taught by their parents\\" would be inaccurate. In conclusion, without further context or clarification regarding the premise \\"because parents aren't parents\\", it is not possible to decisively determine the truth of the hypothesis \\"because kids are not being taught by their parents.\\""},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The closest thing to the description this film has is about a Texas family of five struggling to relate and exist together when they are all very different people. They deal with death, fear, growing up, and just making it through a day. However, the story itself is woven into other visuals that make it just a part of what director Terrence Malick is trying to say. If you want something basic, stay away from this movie entirely. But if you're stricken by movies that make you say. \\"Wait, huh?\\" then you should rush out to see it immediately with someone and plan to hold a summit afterward discussing what it means. A Method To His Madness? The loose, disjointed style of the story involved both the 1950s version of the O'Brien family as well as the present-day version of their oldest son Young Jack. There are no solid beginning-middle-ends in any scene; they play out more like a merory or a dream does in your head. Therefore, the audience is left with less of a definitive statement about what's going on, and more of an emotional connection to what they see on screen. We drift through scenes, getting a vague idea that Mr O'Brien is overbearing and Mrs O'Brien is very nurturing , and that the children are growing up with a strong sense of how to move around the imbalance between their parents. Now, throw in scenes of Sean Penn wandering around the high-tech modern city, looking like the rug has been pulled out from underneath his soul. Add in a dash of nature shots, including but not limited to magrna, the ocean, dinosaurs, and hillsides... What Does It All Mean? It is very clear that Malick wants us to have a sense of this family as a part of the entire universe. A child frightened at his father's touch is a microcosm of the dark expanse above our heads, and it exists alongside the tides, animals, and even God. It all depends on what you believe, which is why this movie is so interesting. Question: We can learn from the text that the director cares most about _ . - something basic that happens in everyday life - how to educate children in different families - something causing people to think and discuss - the importance of protecting endangered anirnals Answer:","completion":"From the text, we can learn that the director, Terrence Malick, cares most about something that causes people to think and discuss. The movie doesn't focus on something basic but rather presents a complex, non-linear narrative that weaves together various visuals and scenes. It is meant to be thought-provoking and encourage discussions among viewers about the meaning behind the story.

This question focuses on identifying potential problems with the Samsung Galaxy J7. In order to provide a helpful response, it would be essential to acquire specific details about the issue(s) encountered. Some common problems that users may experience with the Samsung Galaxy J7 could be related to battery life, software glitches, performance issues, network connectivity, or hardware malfunctions, among others. A useful approach to identifying the particular issue(s) would be to perform troubleshooting steps to narrow down the cause of the problem. These steps may involve: - Force restarting the device - Checking for software updates - Booting the phone in \\"Safe Mode\\" to rule out third-party app interference - Performing a factory reset It's important to note that without details of the actual problem(s) encountered with the Samsung Galaxy J7, it is challenging to provide a specific and accurate solution. 2. What phone network will work for my unlocked Samsung Galaxy J7 HD? This question addresses the compatibility of mobile networks with an unlocked Samsung Galaxy J7 HD. An unlocked device means that it is not tied to a specific carrier and can be used with various service providers. Typically, depending on the region, the Samsung Galaxy J7 HD supports GSM, HSPA, and LTE network technologies. Though, it is essential to consider that there could be regional variations in network compatibility. In practical terms, carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, and their respective MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators) should work with the Galaxy J7 HD in the United States, as they utilize the GSM network. In contrast, carriers such as Verizon and Sprint, which primarily rely on the CDMA network, might not be fully compatible with the device. To ensure network compatibility, it is advisable to check the specific network bands (frequencies) supported by the device against the mobile service provider's supported bands. This information is generally available on the carrier's website or through customer support. In conclusion, while these questions both involve the Samsung Galaxy J7, they address distinct issues and thus are not the same. The first question seeks help for identifying potential problems with the device, while the second question revolves around finding compatible mobile networks for an unlocked Samsung Galaxy J7 HD."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: \\" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.\\" Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. Question: Norwegian farmers and fishermen have an important influence because _ . - they form such a large part of Norwegian ideal - their lives and values represent the Norwegian ideal - their work is so useful to the rest of Norwegian society - they regard oil as a threat to the Norwegian way of life A:","completion":"Norwegian farmers and fishermen have an important influence because their lives and values represent the Norwegian ideal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A criminal inquiry is under way into \\"alleged financial irregularities\\" surrounding the council's loan to the club, known as the Cobblers. Council leader Mary Markham said she was committed to recovering the money. The authority has already spent £450,000 on legal issues including retaining forensic accountants to work out where the money may have gone. It is hoped all the costs will be recovered from the ongoing action to trace the money and from redevelopment of land at Sixfields. The money was loaned to the football club to increase capacity at the stadium and build housing, a hotel and retail units. Work started in early 2014 but the plans were soon downgraded and by September 2015 it was found the club had failed to make repayments on the loan. High Court papers contain allegations developer Howard Grossman and his associates used a \\"substantial part\\" of the money for unrelated purposes. The allegations about County Group, the trading name of companies owned by Mr Grossman, were made in papers filed at the High Court in November 2014. Mr Grossman denied the allegations. The League Two club had initiated legal action to establish what had happened to the loan money and to try to recover it after contractors were not paid.

A criminal inquiry is currently underway to investigate the alleged financial irregularities surrounding the loan. The council has already spent £450,000 on legal issues related to the matter, including hiring forensic accountants to trace where the funds may have gone. The initial purpose of the loan was to increase the stadium's capacity, as well as support the construction of housing, a hotel, and retail units. However, the plans were downgraded, and by September 2015, it was discovered that the football club had failed to make repayments on the loan. High Court papers contain allegations that developer Howard Grossman and his associates used a significant portion of the loan for unrelated purposes. Mr. Grossman denied these allegations. Council leader Mary Markham is committed to recovering the loan money, stating that she would not have invested almost £1 million into the process if she did not believe they would be able to recover a substantial amount from the involved parties. The £500,000 allocated for this purpose comes from the council's reserves and is intended to be used for ongoing efforts to trace the funds and redevelop land at Sixfields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Wishing to encourage her young son to make more progress on the piano, a mother took her boy to a Paderewski concert. After they were seated, the mother spotted a friend in the audience and walked down the aisle to greet her. Seizing the opportunity to explore the wonders of the concert hall, the little boy rose and eventually found his way through a door marked \\"NO ADMITTANCE.\\" When the house lights dimmed and the concert was about to begin, the mother returned to her seat and discovered that the child was missing. Suddenly, the curtains parted and spotlights focused on the impressive Steinway on stage. To her horror, the mother saw her little boy sitting at the keyboard, innocently picking outTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star. At that moment, the great pianist made his entrance, quickly moved to the piano, and whispered in the boy's ear, \\"Don't quit. Keep playing.\\" Then leaning over, Paderewski reached down with his left hand and began filling in a bass part. Soon his right arm reached around to the other side of the child and he added a melody. Together, the old master and the young beginner transformed a frightening situation into a wonderfully creative experience. The audience was amazed and, as it finished, they cheered.

How do astronauts preserve food for long periods of time in space? NASA(the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has been researching food for space travel since the 1960's to find the best way of keeping astronauts from going hungry. The research could date from an accident that took place on the first manned Gemini mission in 1965. astronaut John Young managed to sneak a corned beef sandwich onto the Geminni III capsule to eat during its orbit around Earth. To Young's surprise, the sandwich plan did not go as expected; instead the sandwich began to break apart and scatter through the Geminni IIIcapsule. This could have resulted in disaster, since a small piece of food could have stuck in the air vents and other equipment. The sandwich was stuffed into a pocket to avoid the further mess inside the small space capsule This incident caused NASA to enforce strict rules on what types of food can be taken into space. Space food has come a long way since then. During the Gemini period, the astronauts mostly ate cubed, compressed foods high in calories and lightweight. NASA expects a long shelf life for space food. The majority of food taken into space has been dried out or heat-treated. These process and use of sodium , make the food taken into space last longer. Research is ongoing into space food to seek out healthier ways to preserve it. Too much sodium is unhealthy, and can badly change the taste of some foods.

America's credibility as a superpower is in doubt, he says.","completion":"Title: How the US is Changing Its Strategy in the Mideast Hello boys and girls! Today, we are going to learn about how the United States, a very big and powerful country, is changing the way it deals with other countries in a place called the Mideast. There's a man named Andreas Krieg who wrote about this, and we're going to use what he said to help us understand it better. First, Mr. Krieg tells us that the US is disengaging from the Mideast. This means that they are slowly stepping away and not getting so involved with the things happening there. Just like sometimes, we have to take a step back from a situation and think about it before we join in, the US is doing the same thing in the Mideast. Now, the President in charge of America during this time was named Barack Obama. Mr. Krieg says that he was acting like a \\"lame-duck.\\" This expression means that Obama wasn't able to do as much as before because his time as President was coming to an end, so people didn't listen as much to him. It's like when you're playing a game and you know it's almost time to go home, so you don't try as hard to win anymore. Next, Mr. Krieg explains that if America cooperates well with a country called Tehran, it could actually help them put pressure on their Arab partners. Imagine you have a team for a school project and some team members aren't working hard. If you become friends with one team member and they help you, it becomes easier to get the others to do their part too. That's what America is trying to do in the Mideast with Tehran. Lastly, Mr. Krieg talks about how America's credibility as a superpower is in doubt. This means that people around the world are not sure if America is as strong and important as it used to be. It's like when you were the best runner in your class last year, but this year, other kids are getting faster too, and everyone wonders if you're still the fastest. So, boys and girls, that's what's happening with America and the Mideast. The United States is stepping back from the area, their President was like a lame-duck, but they are trying to make good friends with one country to help them deal with the others.

Let's break down the phrase and analyze its components to better understand why it is perceived as negative. 1. Dread: The word \\"dread\\" refers to a strong fear or apprehension towards something or someone. It conveys uneasiness and anxiety when thinking about or facing a specific situation, event, or person. This is generally regarded as a negative feeling since it causes emotional distress. 2. Encountering: \\"Encountering\\" refers to meeting or coming across something or someone, whether by chance or intentionally. In this context, it is neither positive nor negative on its own, but it takes its emotional tone from the word \\"dread.\\" 3. The most: This phrase intensifies the dread experienced, referring to an encounter that is perceived as the worst, or the most feared, among all potential encounters. It underscores the extreme discomfort the person feels about the situation, adding to the negativity. When combining these elements—dread, encountering, and the most—we get the phrase \\"dread encountering the most.\\" This phrase highlights strong feelings of anxiety and discomfort connected to the thought of facing a particularly difficult or upsetting scenario, which results in a negative interpretation of the phrase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I start my day with a good breakfast.","completion":"In both sentences, the word \\"start\\" is used to indicate the beginning or initiation of something, albeit in slightly different contexts. In the first sentence, \\"Start a new job,\\" the word \\"start\\" is employed as an imperative verb, which means that it is acting as a command or a directive given by one person to another. The speaker is directing someone to begin a new job or encouraging them to kick off a new career or employment opportunity. This could refer to entering a new position, company, or field of work. Additionally, this usage highlights the initiation of a specific event or action. In the second sentence, \\"I start my day with a good breakfast,\\" the word \\"start\\" is used as a simple present tense verb. In this context, it describes a routine action that the speaker usually follows to initiate their day. This statement conveys the idea that the speaker regularly begins their day by having a good breakfast as part of their daily habits. In this case, the word \\"start\\" focuses on a recurring action within the routine practices of an individual rather than highlighting the commencement of a specific event or activity as seen in the first sentence. In summary, while the word \\"start\\" conveys the notion of beginning something in both sentences, the context and the function of the verb differ. In the first sentence, \\"start\\" takes the form of an imperative, addressing a specific initiation of a new job. In contrast, the second sentence uses \\"start\\" in the simple present tense, referring to a repeated action or habit that signifies a consistent way of commencing one's day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness.

Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy).

He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

Article: You can't always know when there'll be a heavy rain or when to take an umbrella with you. But designer Mikhail Belyaev doesn't think that forgetting to check the weather report before going out should cause you to get wet in the rain. That's why he created the Lampbrella--a lamp post with its own \\"umbrella\\". The designer says he came up with the idea after watching people get wet on streets in Russia. \\"Once, I was driving on a central Saint Petersburg street and saw people trying to hide from the rain under the street lamps. I thought it would be a good idea to have a Lampbrella built into a street lamp.\\" he said. The Lampbrella is a street lamp fitted with an umbrella canopy . It has an inside electric motor which can open or close the umbrella freely. The Lampbrella will offer people cover whenever it starts raining. After three minutes of not being used the canopy is closed. According to the designer, the Lampbrella would move at a very low speed in order not to cause harm to people. What's more, it would be grounded to protect from a possible lightning hit. Each Lampbrella would offer enough cover for several people. Being 2 meters off the ground, it would only be a danger for the tallest man. While there are no plans to take the Lampbrella into production , Belyaev says he recently introduced his creation to one Moscow company, and insists his creation could be on any street where a lot of people walk but there are no canopies to provide cover.

Prince Harry during his 10-week spell in Helmand province, Aghanistan. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images It has never been scared of airing controversial programmes about the royal family – and later this month Channel 4 will broadcast its latest, a dramatised documentary about the hypothetical kidnapping of Prince Harry while on military duty in Afghanistan. In the 70-minute programme to be shown on 21 October, Harry, played by Sebastian Reid, is kidnapped after the Apache helicopter he is flying crashes, and is then taken to Pakistan. When a British-born fighter recognises him, he is forced to appear in a video for the Taliban demanding troops leave Afghanistan. Harry is shown appearing on a Taliban video saying: \\"My name is Captain Harry Wales. I'm being fed, I'm comfortable and I'm being looked after very well. The price of my release is that coalition troops must leave Afghanistan, starting immediately. If that does not happen, I will never return home and you will never find my body.\\" Hamish Mykura, Channel 4's head of documentaries, justified the subject matter by saying it was clear that kidnapping in Afghanistan is on the increase and the Prince would be a target were he to return. \\"It's a very real and live issue and one that we think is well worth exploring.\\" But while the programme also includes extensive interviews with former intelligence officers, military commanders, negotiators, as well as those who had previously been held hostage – including Guardian journalist Shoaib Sharifi and Jere Van Dyk, the CBS journalist who was held hostage for 45 days in 2008 – Channel 4's approach is likely to raise questions. The programme's focus on Prince Harry will prompt accusations of sensationalism. But the broadcaster says it has acted responsibly and was careful not to show anything on screen that experts did not believe could happen. It also says it is correct to question whether Britain should allow high-value targets to be on the front line. \\"If you're going to analyse that it's probably a story best told by looking at the number one target in this situation. And Prince Harry is the number one target,\\" Mykura said. According to Channel 4, the royal family had been informed about the programme, but had not made any response. Today a spokesman for Clarence House said: \\"We're not going to comment on this work of fiction.\\" Prince Harry served in Afghanistan's Helmand province as a forward air controller for 10 weeks from December 2007. Due to worries that he could become a Taliban target, his presence in the country was kept secret with a news blackout agreed between the UK media and the Ministry of Defence. The blackout was broken when news aggregator the Drudge Report ran a story about his deployment, and Harry was flown home. Earlier this year, it was reported that the prince wanted to return to Afghanistan to fly the Lynx attack helicopter. Channel 4 said it had discussed whether The Taking of Prince Harry would \\"simply put ideas into people's heads\\", but decided that there were already websites calling for him to be made a target. \\"It's clearly not an idea that would be new to the Taliban or al-Qaida or to their supporters,\\" Mykura said. There will likely be questions, however, about why it was felt necessary to make the programme as a dramatised documentary – with heightened scripted sections between interviews with experts – rather than a more traditional documentary. ||||| PRINCE Harry was last night furious at a new Channel 4 drama that shows him captured by the TALIBAN ï¿½ and turning TRAITOR. What if? ... Prince Harry on duty The shock programme later this month sees the soldier prince begging for his life at gunpoint as terrorists video him. Harry, 26 ï¿½ played by lookalike actor Sebastian Reid ï¿½ pleads: \\"All Western troops must withdraw from Afghanistan or they will behead me.\\" Last night Top Brass were also appalled by the programme ï¿½ amid speculation that Harry is poised for a second tour of duty in Afghanistan. His first lasted just ten weeks amid a media blackout 2ï¿½ years ago to prevent him being a Taliban target ï¿½ until a magazine blew his cover. The Palace yesterday echoed ex-Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Guthrie who slammed the new \\"docu drama\\" ï¿½ mixing real news footage with fiction ï¿½ as \\"extremely unhelpful for all our soldiers in Afghanistan\\". It even shows top secret Cobra emergency meetings as the crisis deepens ï¿½ based on info from an army of respected advisers. They include Richard Kemp, who was commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, and exï¿½Scotland Yard special ops supremo Andy Hayman CBE. Defiant makers of The Taking Of Prince Harry yesterday insisted threats to kidnap him were \\"already out there\\". Their programme on October 21 shows him captured after surviving a helicopter crash. A terrorist with a Midlands accent recognises him. He is sprung from a jail after it is bombed by CIA drones.

Please answer the following question: An equilibrium can also be disrupted by the full or partial removal of a reactant or product. If the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-Bosch process, NH 3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward reaction is favored so that more NH 3 will be produced. The concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease. Continued removal of NH 3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up. If either N 2 or H 2 were removed from the equilibrium system, the reverse reaction would be favored, and the concentration of NH 3 would decrease. Jennifer and Justin are examining the principle of chemical equilibrium in their second year organic chemistry course. They are performing a reaction that involves hydrogen gas and glucose as the starting reactants, and the products formed in the reaction are carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. Jennifer and Justin add the materials, and then wait until the reaction has reached equilibrium. Afterwards, Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture, while Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture. Which person's reaction, Jennifer's or Justin's, will begin producing more carbon dioxide? Answer:","completion":"In this scenario, Jennifer and Justin are conducting a chemical reaction with hydrogen gas and glucose as reactants and carbon dioxide and oxygen gas as products. They both wait until the reaction reaches equilibrium before proceeding with their modifications. Jennifer removes glucose, one of the reactants, while Justin removes carbon dioxide, one of the products. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if a change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to reduce the effect of that change. In the case of Jennifer, by removing glucose (a reactant), the reaction will try to replenish the lost reactant. Thus, the reaction will shift in the direction of the reactants, consuming more hydrogen gas and producing less carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. On the other hand, when Justin removes carbon dioxide (a product), the reaction will try to restore the balance by producing more of the removed product. Hence, the reaction will shift in the direction of the products, consuming more hydrogen gas and glucose and producing more carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. In conclusion, Justin's reaction will begin producing more carbon dioxide as his modification causes the reaction to shift towards the products in order to counteract the removal of carbon dioxide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:I can't quite believe it, because I am a 43-year-old mum-of-three. And until eight months ago, I hadn't taken part in any regular physical exercise for 10 years. But on Sunday, after two months of training, and in full view of the public, I wore a sparkly leotard, and danced and tumbled my way round a gymnasium. I could have tramped around the mat dressed as a pantomime horse and still won It seems so preposterous - particularly the leotard. But it happened. Me, on a podium, with a gold medal around my neck after winning Women's Artistic Gymnastics Novice in the 17th Pat English Scottish Formers Championships. Admittedly there were no other competitors in the over-40s novice category. I could have tramped around the mat dressed as a pantomime horse and still won. But this is a mere detail for me. I have achieved my sporting career highlight - long after I had forgotten I actually had a sporty side. I was one of those girls at school who relished cross-country running around the rugby fields. I enjoyed getting up early on cold Saturdays for hockey games played on unforgiving blaes pitches. And outside school, for three years I trained three times a week at a local gymnastics club, before switching my passion and time to ballet for another five years. But after I left school, my sporting career pretty much fell off a cliff. When the hare-brained idea of entering an adults gymnastics competition recently entered my mind - I thought it would be a story focused on experiencing the joys of glory long after I believed possible. What I didn't expect to find is that the actual highs have come from having a new hobby. Kids seem to instinctively treat sports as hobbies. But as an adult, keeping active can start to feel like an unnecessary evil. I entered a whole new world when I took up gymnastics, and initially I wasn't sure I would fit in. Luckily my friend Nicola, a lapsed gymnast and fellow mum, persuaded me to persevere. And thankfully, the gymnastics/parkour/martial arts freestyle folk at our local gymnastic club's adult sessions didn't laugh at the sight of two middle-aged women practising forward-rolls and cartwheels. Anyway, 60-year-old Peter Duncan (the action man of Blue Peter during my childhood) had already demonstrated that it was not too late for me to take up gymnastics. The former children's TV presenter recently took part in the BBC's celebrity Tumble programme. My new world kept getting bigger. Peter Duncan's Tumble partner, Kate McWilliam, turned out to be a coach at a couple of classes I attended at a local circus school. Then my daughter's gymnastics club let me and my friend Nicola use their gym a couple of times to practise our floor routines, and one of the coaches helped me develop my skills. And hobbies, it turns out, don't stop at the gym door, they spill out into pubs and restaurants for obligatory nights out (and medal celebrations). Of course, the journey to that podium moment has been about developing my strength and flexibility and overcoming fear when trying new tumbles. But it's also been about discovering a ready-made community, which reaches out with help, support and enthusiasm to new recruits who \\"get\\" their passion. As for my daughters, they seem completely unfazed about me doing gymnastics. I may have unwittingly led them to believe that sport is a fun and integral part of life, and not some metaphorical ogre that adults must fight. I'll take the gold medal for that alone!

A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower. - Tertiary education, also referred to as third stage, third level, and post-secondary education, is the educational level following the completion of a school providing a secondary education. The World Bank, for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as institutions that teach specific capacities of higher learning such as colleges, technical training institutes, community colleges, nursing schools, research laboratories, centers of excellence, and distance learning centers. Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education and training beyond secondary education is known as \\"further education\\" in the United Kingdom, or \\"continuing education\\" in the United States. - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education. - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving. - Secondary education normally takes place in secondary schools, taking place after primary education and may be followed by higher education or vocational training. In some countries, only primary or basic education is compulsory, but secondary education is included in compulsory education in most countries. In post-Soviet countries it is also known as general education or general middle education. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, similar to continuing education in the United States, is a term used to refer to education (in addition to that received at secondary school), that is distinct from the higher education offered in universities and also some FE colleges. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. In addition, HE qualifications are often provided such as HNC, HND, Foundation Degree or PGCE. FE colleges are also a large provider of apprenticeships, where most of the training takes place in the apprentices' workplace with some day release into college. - National Higher Education Fund Corporation ( Malay : Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional ) , abbreviated PTPTN is an authority responsible for giving study loans to students pursuing tertiary education in Malaysia . This agency is under Ministry of Education . The PTPTN 's Chairman is Shamsul Anuar Nasarah , member of the Malaysian Parliament for the seat of Lenggong in Perak . - Postgraduate education, or graduate education in North America, involves learning and studying for academic or professional degrees, academic or professional certificates, academic or professional diplomas, or other qualifications for which a first or bachelor's degree generally is required, and it is normally considered to be part of higher education. In North America, this level is generally referred to as graduate school. What is the relationship between 'perbadanan tabung pendidikan tinggi nasional' and 'organization'?

Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Teacher:You are given a target profession, and two sentences. Your task is to determine whether the second sentence is either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Target: commander The commander settled into civilian life.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. But I can use this background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. What is an answer for this question: Which country would have lower labor supply in response to their taxation? A:","completion":"A: Based on the provided information and the Laffer curve theory, France would have a lower labor supply in response to their taxation since they implemented tax rates above the critical rate, leading to a decline in labor supply.
