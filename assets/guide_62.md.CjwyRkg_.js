In the second quarter, the Cowboys got on the scoreboard when they culminated a 64-yard, 10-play drive with a 38-yard field goal by Nick Folk. On their ensuing possession, the Patriots advanced 12&#160;yards before Brady was strip-sacked by defensive end Greg Ellis; defensive end Jason Hatcher recovered the ball and returned it 29&#160;yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 14-10.

Help as much as you can. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Listening to music can help me focus better. Since I discovered it two years ago,I've used music to get through boring work or to focus creatively. I've found that it can make even the dullest jobs enjoyable and help clear mental blocks to creativity. I first noticed the good effects of music while playing video games. It was a few days before Christmas in 2005 and I was playing online video games. My parents had just given me a new MP3,so I decided to listen to music through the headphones while I played. After a few minutes I noticed a great change in my style of play. I was playing more naturally. The music relaxed me,and,to a certain extent,distracted me from the game,allowing my subconscious talent to come through. The music also helped me block out the outside world. With those headphones on I was like a machine,moving from one task to the next without unnecessary thoughts or actions. Music can also have a great effect on mood. If I'm in a bad mood at work,I'll listen to some of Bob Marley's and get down to business. It always takes my mind off what I'm doing and makes me a happier person. The same is true for classic rock. One summer,I did a boring job collecting bottle openers by hand. Without a radio playing classic rock in the background,I would have hated life. Listening to music with relaxing rhythms and a positive message helps you forget your work and think happy thoughts. But the results you see will depend heavily on your personal tastes. Experiment with the types of music you listen to during certain tasks. By trial and error you'll finally discover your best choice. I'm always looking for new concentration aids,so I'd love to know what type of music works best for me. Question: We can infer that the passage was written in _ .

Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs. Which city is more likely to run out of the material used to generate electricity first? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.

The maximum amount of beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US gallons) a year. A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment. The highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of Franconia, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which has about 200 breweries.

Please add spaces between words: Uninstallation:AsDLLfilesarecreatedtosupportotherprogramsandsoftwaresworkingwell,thedataandfunctionsareactuallysharedbymanyprograms.whenyouuninstallaprogram,certutil.exemaybemistakenlydeleted.","completion":"Uninstallation: As DLL files are created to support other programs and software working well, the data and functions are actually shared by many programs. When you uninstall a program, certutil.exe may be mistakenly deleted. Let's break down this text for better understanding: Uninstallation: Uninstalling a program refers to the process of removing software or applications from a computer system. This process typically involves deleting all the files related to the installed program, and even modifying the registry or other system parameters to revert back to their pre-installation state. DLL files: Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) files are essential components that are used by various programs and applications on a computer. They include libraries of functions, data, and other resources that can be shared by multiple programs. DLL files foster efficient management of system resources and help avoid duplication of code and data. Shared data and functions: Since DLL files are designed to provide functionality and resources to multiple applications, they inherently contain shared data, functions, and other information. This allows for more efficient use of system resources and reduced redundancy. Certutil.exe: Certutil.exe is a command-line utility that is used for managing certificates on a Windows system. It allows administrators to perform certificate-related tasks such as viewing, installing, updating, or deleting certificates. It also helps in troubleshooting and diagnosing certificate issues. Mistakenly deleted: The deletion of certutil.exe by accident or as part of an uninstallation process of another program can result in a lost or corrupted executable file, which may lead to the malfunctioning or failure of the programs relying on it. In summary, the uninstallation of a program might lead to the accidental deletion of essential files such as certutil.exe, which can affect the functioning of other programs and software on the system due to their reliance on the shared resources available in these DLL files. Thus, it is essential to be cautious when uninstalling programs and ensure that critical files and functions are preserved to maintain the proper functioning of your computer system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the word \\"substitute\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","completion":"In both sentences, the word \\"substitute\\" shares a common theme of one thing replacing or standing in for another thing. However, the context in which the word \\"substitute\\" is used in these sentences is different, making the meaning of the word differ between the two instances. In the first sentence, \\"The young teacher had to substitute for the sick colleague,\\" the word \\"substitute\\" is used as a verb to describe the action taken by the young teacher. In this context, \\"substitute\\" means to take the place of or perform the duties of someone else, usually on a temporary basis. The young teacher is stepping in to fulfill the role and responsibilities of the sick colleague, ensuring that their job is taken care of until the sick colleague is able to return to work. The usage of \\"substitute\\" here is primarily associated with a temporary replacement of a person in a specific position or role. In the second sentence, \\"The skim milk substitutes for cream -- we are on a strict diet,\\" the word \\"substitute\\" is also used as a verb, but the context shifts from replacing people or roles to replacing objects or ingredients in this case. Thus, \\"substitute\\" in this context means to replace one thing with another, usually due to the necessity of a specific outcome, such as adhering to a strict diet in this example. Skim milk is being used in place of cream, which may be due to reasons like lower fat content and fewer calories. The meaning of \\"substitute\\" in this sentence is focused on replacing an object or ingredient to achieve a desired result or meet specific requirements. In summary, while the word \\"substitute\\" generally denotes the act of replacement in both sentences, the specific meaning and context of usage differ between the two. In the first sentence, \\"substitute\\" refers to the temporary replacement of a person in a role or position, while in the second sentence, it refers to the replacement of an object or ingredient to achieve a specific outcome or adhere to certain requirements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During this time, she gives a voiceover as if talking to a psychiatrist who she thinks will put her on antidepressants, and she gives a prediction of her life all the way to her old age.At home, Veronika pours herself a drink and takes a number of prescription medications out of her bathroom medicine cabinet.

Does it follow that \\"There is no waste whatsoever on the railroad, due to careful planning.\\"? Choices: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no.","completion":"3). No. While careful planning can significantly reduce waste and inefficiencies in the railroad industry, stating that \\"there is no waste whatsoever on the railroad, due to careful planning\\" would be an overstatement. In any large infrastructure system such as the railroad industry, there will be some level of waste or inefficiencies, even with meticulous planning. Let's break it down: 1. Coordination failures: As you mentioned, in the early days of railroads, each line had a different gauge, leading to coordination failures and waste. This inefficiency was later reduced by adopting standardized gauges worldwide, but there still might be occasional compatibility issues when interacting with older infrastructure or railroads in remote regions that do not follow the standard. Moreover, challenges arising from coordination among multiple railroad companies, scheduling, and resource allocation continue to contribute to some level of waste. 2. Human errors: No matter how well-designed a system is, human errors can happen, which can lead to waste. For instance, employees might make mistakes in loading, scheduling, or operating trains. Proper training, technological advancements, and strict operational guidelines can limit these errors, but eliminating them completely is highly unlikely. 3. Economic factors: Fluctuations in demand for rail transportation or changes in global trade patterns can sometimes lead to empty or underutilized railcars, which generates waste as they still consume resources such as fuel and labor. While some of these fluctuations can be anticipated and planned for, predicting every change is not feasible. 4. Maintenance and asset management: Railroads require ongoing maintenance and asset management to ensure efficiency. With wear and tear, rail infrastructure and rolling stock require repair or replacement due to damage or technological obsolescence. This process can experience inefficiencies, such as delays in procuring parts or completing repairs, which can contribute to waste in the system. 5. Environmental factors: Weather-related disruptions, such as storms or floods, can cause temporary or permanent damage to rail infrastructure, increasing inefficiencies. Although precautionary measures and risk mitigation plans can help reduce the impact of such events, completely avoiding the waste caused by these unpredictable occurrences is unlikely. In conclusion, while careful planning and advanced technology can significantly minimize waste in the railroad industry, it is implausible to claim that there will be no waste whatsoever. There will always be some level of waste due to unexpected events, human errors, and the ever-evolving nature of the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Since you mention that everything is one-sided sometimes, it suggests that he might not be open to discussing this topic or understanding your concerns completely.

After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Background: Rudolf Joseph Lorenz Steiner (27 (or 25) February 1861 - 30 March 1925) was an Austrian philosopher, social reformer, architect and esotericist. Steiner gained initial recognition at the end of the nineteenth century as a literary critic and published philosophical works including The Philosophy of Freedom. At the beginning of the twentieth century he founded an esoteric spiritual movement, anthroposophy, with roots in German idealist philosophy and theosophy; other influences include Goethean science and Rosicrucianism. In the first, more philosophically oriented phase of this movement, Steiner attempted to find a synthesis between science and spirituality. Context: Steiner's father, Johann(es) Steiner (1829 - 1910), left a position as a gamekeeper in the service of Count Hoyos in Geras, northeast Lower Austria to marry one of the Hoyos family's housemaids, Franziska Blie (1834 Horn - 1918, Horn), a marriage for which the Count had refused his permission. Johann became a telegraph operator on the Southern Austrian Railway, and at the time of Rudolf's birth was stationed in Kraljevec in the Murakoz region of the Austrian Empire (present-day Donji Kraljevec in the Medimurje region of northernmost Croatia). In the first two years of Rudolf's life, the family moved twice, first to Modling, near Vienna, and then, through the promotion of his father to stationmaster, to Pottschach, located in the foothills of the eastern Austrian Alps in Lower Austria. Steiner entered the village school; following a disagreement between his father and the schoolmaster, he was briefly educated at home. In 1869, when Steiner was eight years old, the family moved to the village of Neudorfl and in October 1872 Steiner proceeded from the village school there to the realschule in Wiener Neustadt. In 1879, the family moved to Inzersdorf to enable Steiner to attend the Vienna Institute of Technology, where he studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, biology, literature, and philosophy on an academic scholarship from 1879 to 1883, at the end of which time he withdrew from the institute without graduating. In 1882, one of Steiner's teachers, Karl Julius Schroer, suggested Steiner's name to Joseph Kurschner, chief editor of a new edition of Goethe's works, who asked Steiner to become the edition's natural science editor, a truly astonishing opportunity for a young student without any form of academic credentials or previous publications. Before attending the Vienna Institute of Technology, Steiner had studied Kant, Fichte and Schelling. Question: Did any of is professors have an impact on his life? Answer:","completion":"Yes, several of Rudolf Steiner's professors and teachers had a significant impact on his life, influencing his thoughts, work, and career trajectory. One particularly influential teacher to Steiner was Karl Julius Schröer (1825–1900), whom he met while attending the Vienna Institute of Technology. Schröer was a philologist, literary historian, and an expert in the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He recognized Steiner's aptitude for the natural sciences and his deep interest in Goethe's works. Schröer recommended Steiner's name to Joseph Kürschner, the chief editor of a new edition of Goethe's works, leading to Steiner's appointment as the natural science editor for the project. This opportunity allowed Steiner to delve deeper into Goethe's worldview and refine his own perspectives on the synthesis of science and spirituality. In addition to Schröer, Steiner was influenced by the ideas of several philosophers and idealist thinkers during his time at the Vienna Institute of Technology. Before attending the institute, he had already studied the works of Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. These philosophers contributed significantly to Steiner's intellectual development, shaping his perspectives on the relationship between the material and the spiritual world. The education Steiner received at the institute further exposed him to various scientific disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, and biology. This broad base of knowledge would later allow him to integrate scientific principles with his spiritual views in the formation of the anthroposophical movement. In summary, Rudolf Steiner's life and work were unmistakably impacted by his professors and the education he received. Their guidance, along with Steiner's engagement with the works of significant philosophers and scientists, allowed him to develop and articulate his unique perspectives on the synthesis of science and spirituality in his later life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: what is the name of the girl in clifford the big red dog?","completion":"The name of the girl in Clifford the Big Red Dog is Emily Elizabeth Howard. She is a main character in the book series written by Norman Bridwell, which began in 1963, and the subsequent animated television series that followed. Emily Elizabeth is a caring and kind-hearted young girl who is the owner and best friend of Clifford, the titular Big Red Dog. She is characterized by her strong bond with and unwavering love for her oversized canine companion. Emily Elizabeth received Clifford as a tiny red puppy from an animal rescue. She chose him out of all the puppies because of their instant connection and her assurance that she could love him more than anyone else in the world. Due to her tremendous love, Clifford grew into a gigantic dog, a defining characteristic of the series. Emily Elizabeth's name in the books and show is actually a tribute to the author Norman Bridwell's own daughter, whose name is also Emily Elizabeth. The Clifford the Big Red Dog stories revolve around the humorous and adventurous escapades of Clifford and Emily Elizabeth, along with their friends and neighbors on Birdwell Island. Emily Elizabeth's youthful voice of reason, wisdom, and kindness helps to resolve many of the characters' various dilemmas and, ultimately, sets an example of how love, patience, and understanding can create positive changes in the world. The franchise has continued to capture the imagination and touch the hearts of both children and adults alike, teaching valuable life lessons through the endearing bond shared by Emily Elizabeth and her colossal red dog, Clifford."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Review: talked all the way through it Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"This movie review sentence can be perceived as negative, as it seems to be expressing discontent with the experience of attending the movie screening. The phrase \\"talked all the way through it\\" implies that there was an excessive amount of conversation throughout the movie, which could have been distracting and diminishing the overall enjoyment for the person who wrote the review. It is important to note that people have varying opinions and preferences regarding their experiences, and while this review may seem negative to some, others might interpret the statement as a matter of personal preference. Some individuals may enjoy having discussions and sharing opinions during a movie, as it fosters a sense of camaraderie and engagement. However, in the typical context of attending a movie screening, where the environment is meant to be quiet and focused on the audiovisual elements of the film, such behavior may be considered rude, disruptive, and unappreciative of the artistry and narrative of the film. In general, the goal of attending a movie is to immerse oneself in the cinematic experience, which can be compromised by constant talking during the movie. As a result, the review sentence provided can be categorized as predominantly negative. It suggests that the writer's experience of watching the movie was affected by people constantly talking, leaving them with a less-than-ideal impression. Additionally, it might even indicate that the film did not hold the viewer's attention enough to prevent them from talking throughout the movie. Overall, this sentence primarily conveys dissatisfaction or a negative experience with the movie screening."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Actually, they were cut by good editors--it's hard to sound like Jane Austen and this author misses by a mile, so the little essays just sound precious. Sorry, but its leaden prose, and surprisingly passionless given its subject. Unlike a few other reviewers, I had no objection to the idea of eroticizing the classics, but this book doesn't, in many ways, pull it off. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","completion":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses disappointment in several aspects of the book, which ultimately leads to a negative impression of the product. Here's a breakdown of the criticisms mentioned in the review: 1. Discrepancy between the book's premise and its execution: The reviewer acknowledges the witty idea of presenting scenes supposedly cut from Jane Austen novels by censors. However, they believe that the actual content of the book falls short of this inventive claim, as the scenes were likely removed for editorial reasons rather than censorship. 2. Writing style: The author of the book is criticized for failing to emulate Jane Austen's writing style convincingly. According to the reviewer, the essays in the book come across as \\"precious\\" instead of mimicking the authentic tone of Austen's novels. 3. Prose quality: The reviewer refers to the book's prose as \\"leaden,\\" which suggests that they find the writing dull, monotonous, and lacking vitality. This further emphasizes the discrepancy between the book's innovative premise and the actual content. 4. Lack of passion: Despite the book's intent to provide an erotic take on classic literature, the reviewer finds it \\"surprisingly passionless,\\" implying that the book does not deliver on its promised exploration of sensuality. 5. Ineffectiveness in eroticizing the classics: The reviewer explicitly states that they have no objection to the concept of adding erotic elements to classic literature. However, they believe that this book fails to \\"pull it off\\" in many ways, further highlighting the gap between the book's premise and its execution. In conclusion, the review portrays the product in an unflattering light, as it highlights the book's shortcomings and disappointments, particularly in terms of writing style, prose quality, and effectiveness in achieving the desired eroticization of classic literature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: Chances are that if you are reading this in or near New York City now, meaning sometime between the 22nd and 26th day of the seventh month of the 17th year of the 21st century, you are very hot. You are almost assuredly irritated as well as hot, because as Samantha Gillison recently put it in a column in The Guardian, explaining New York summers to those fortunate enough to spend them in London, “Being confronted by your own cosmic insignificance as you struggle through an inferno to get to your dumb job can be a deeply unpleasant sensation.” Summer in New York demands an inner reckoning, she suggested, a re-evaluation of every life choice you’ve ever made. What are you doing here? If you are a parent keeping a child in the city on an especially brutal weekend, when you might simply be forced to stay inside revisiting the entire Pixar canon, it can feel as if you are imposing what would count as a code-red abuse among the affluenza class, roughly equivalent to permitting the consumption of a street vendor’s hot dog. During periods of intense heat, mayors stress the importance of air-conditioning, as Bill de Blasio did this month, while also stressing that you shouldn’t use too much of it. Setting temperatures below 78 degrees is bad citizenship because it can threaten the power grid. Air-conditioning is never quite right in New York, as anyone who has lived here knows — in offices it is too cold; in homes it is not cold enough. Water, of course, is elusive. This year, though, the mayor committed to keeping certain large public pools open until 8 p.m. and playground sprinklers on until dark. He also reminded New Yorkers that they can travel to a local fire station — if they are able to prove that they are 18 or older — and obtain a spray cap with which to open a fire hydrant safely. But fire hydrants are not the Adirondacks or the Atlantic Ocean. Perhaps it was inevitable that the sharing economy would, in all its professed virtue, come up with a way to make you feel as if you owned a summer place when you didn’t have one. A few weeks ago came the birth of Second House, a club in which you apply to spend one weekend or many in a well-appointed home out of the city with strangers, vetted by the company to ensure not only that the strangers in question are disinclined to extreme lunacy but that they are, as the website puts it, “creative, entrepreneurial, soulful, independent, globally minded, optimistic, social, innovative and fun-loving.” The idea is to build a collection of these houses no more than two and a half hours outside major cities around the world. Second House will rent or buy them or manage them for people who use their vacation homes infrequently. The first and only house so far went into full operation, on the North Fork of Long Island, during the first weekend in July, with membership at 2,000 for 24 days of tenancy. No more than 10 people are ever together at once. A host from the company is always present. Families are welcome, sometimes, particularly those with a single child who are not averse to co-sleeping. A better world through the disruption of the Hamptons summer share! The company was developed by a group of women, one a former banker from the Netherlands who worked for years in Milan and reveled in the particularities of bourgeois Italian weekend rituals — you always left the city and always to join big groups of friends and family. A company representative meets applicants beforehand, although one meeting does not necessarily prove sanity. So there are recurring events in the city where company members and potential guests can engage one another. And these events require you to do more than sit around and drink rosé. You get together to learn about natural nutrition or to view an exhibition of photographs from Burma or to learn about the interplay of architecture, mood and health, the subject of a recent discussion that included a representative from an outfit called Delos, which bills itself as the world’s first “wellness” real estate firm. (Because when you think of self-restoration and reducing anxiety, you always think of Manhattan real estate.) There are also communal dinners in town, and if the vetting process fails — if a selfish bore who takes the last glass of orange juice in the morning and demands that Fox News be on all day somehow slips through — the offending party will never be invited back to the house. “It doesn’t appeal to everyone,” one of the people at Second House told me, “which is a good thing.” For the lumps and the losers, the loudmouths and the guys who’ll cheat at Boggle, there is always the local hook and ladder and a cold spritz.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

The eruptive products range from basaltic andesite to rhyolite and rhyodacite. It is a predominantly rhyolitic stratovolcano overlying an older shield structure. Its modern structure is no more than 50,000 years old, and it last erupted about 2,000 years ago. Although its first eruptive events from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago were predominantly rhyolitic, between 38,000 and 32,000 years ago the volcano began to alternate between dacitic/rhyodacitic and rhyolitic eruptions. The volcano built a broad andesitic cone, forming a steep summit cone of andesite about 27,000 years ago. South Sister remained dormant for 15,000 years, after which its composition shifted from dacitic to more rhyolitic lava. An eruptive episode about 2,200 years ago, termed the Rock Mesa eruptive cycle, first spread volcanic ash from flank vents from the south and southwest flanks, followed by a thick rhyolite lava flow. Next, the Devils Hill eruptive cycle consisted of explosive ash eruptions followed by viscous rhyolitic lava flows. Unlike the previous eruptive period, it was caused by the intrusion of a dike of new silicic magma that erupted from 20 vents on the southeast side and from a smaller line on the north side. These eruptions generated pyroclastic flows and lava domes from vents on the northern, southern, eastern, and southeastern sides of the volcano. These relatively recent, postglacial eruptions suggest the presence of a silicic magma reservoir under South Sister, one that could perhaps lead to future eruptions. Unlike its sister peaks, South Sister has an uneroded summit crater about 0.25 mi (0.40 km) in diameter that holds a small crater lake known as Teardrop Pool, the highest lake in Oregon.

All three major party leaders signed up to a \\"vow\\" to deliver further devolution last September. The move was a bid to head off a Yes vote in the independence referendum. The Smith Commission drew up proposals for change within three months of the vote. In the new report, the House of Lords Constitution Committee said the party leaders' public commitment to change appeared to have \\"pre-empted any meaningful scrutiny\\" of the proposals by the public or parliaments in Westminster and Holyrood. It voiced \\"deep concern\\" at the speed with which Lord Smith of Kelvin was told to complete his work, which did not allow \\"adequate time for engagement and consultation\\". The committee expressed \\"astonishment\\" that the UK government \\"do not appear to have considered the wider implications for the United Kingdom of the proposals\\". It said it was \\"not appropriate or sustainable\\" to address the issues of additional powers for Scotland alone without considering the knock-on consequences for the wider UK constitution. The report found the process leading up to the proposals being set out \\"does not meet the expected standard for implementing proposals for constitutional change\\" and \\"undermines confidence in the outcome\\". The UK Parliament should not \\"simply accept these significant constitutional changes as a fait accompli\\" but should \\"ensure they receive the detailed scrutiny they require and any amendment that may be necessary\\", the report continued. Committee chairman Lord Lang of Monkton said: \\"The recommendations in the Smith Commission report clearly have profound constitutional implications for every part of the UK. \\"However, the UK Parliament is expected to pass these proposals into law without significant amendment despite having been, in effect, excluded from the decision-making process. This is not the way to implement significant constitutional change. \\"We were astonished to hear that the government have not properly considered the impact on the rest of the UK of implementing the Smith Commission proposals. Piecemeal, ad hoc changes to the Scottish devolution settlement without wider consideration of their impact could well destabilise the Union as a whole in the longer term.\\" Lord Lang added: \\"The major UK-wide political parties need urgently to devise and articulate a vision for the future shape of the Union and its devolution settlements. Without this, there cannot be any long-term constitutional stability.\\" The UK government said it was \\"committed to a balanced settlement for all parts of the UK\\". A spokesman added: \\"The Smith Commission agreement was backed by all of Scotland's main parties and was underpinned by a principle the agreement would 'not cause detriment to the UK as a whole nor any of its constituent parts'. \\"We do not agree with the committee's assertion that the UK and Scottish Parliaments have been excluded from the process. \\"The UK Government produced draft clauses to implement the agreement, published these clauses in a Command Paper presented to both Parliaments and have since invited feedback. The Committee's report today responds to that request for feedback and we will consider the recommendations made by the Committee. \\"Following the general election the three pro-UK parties in Scotland have all committed to bring forward a bill in the next session of Parliament where both the UK Parliament and Scottish Parliament will be able to consider and scrutinise the Bill in the normal way.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The leaders of the three major parties agreed to give more power to Scotland last year, so that Scotland would not want to become an independent country.

Options: - bar - human being - cemetary - graveyard - earth The answer to this question is:","completion":"human being. The most suitable option to answer the given question about the spirit that ascended to the afterlife is \\"human being.\\" To understand this choice, it's essential to consider the concept of the spirit and its relationship with the human experience. In most belief systems and philosophical schools of thought, the spirit is considered an integral part of an individual's existence. It is often described as the essence or soul, the part of a person's being that transcends the tangible aspects of life like the physical body and material experiences. The spirit is commonly believed to represent the core of consciousness, emotions, and personal identity. When discussing the afterlife, many cultures and religions hold that the human spirit exits the physical body upon death and continues to exist in another realm or state of being. This belief is often rooted in the idea that there is more to life than the temporary, material world, and that the spirit is an eternal, non-physical entity capable of experiencing the afterlife. Given this context, it makes the most sense to choose \\"human being\\" as the answer to the question. This is because when the spirit ascends to the afterlife, it is leaving the human body and the physical world behind and embarking on a new journey or state of existence. Although graveyards, cemeteries, and earth as a whole are related to the experience of human life and death, none of these options point to the specific element that the spirit is parting from – the human being. It is essential to acknowledge that different belief systems and cultures might have various interpretations and understanding of the concept of the spirit, the afterlife, and their connection to the world we inhabit. The answer provided here is a general explanation grounded in the information provided in the question and popular beliefs surrounding the spirit's departure from a human being in most belief systems."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands? is inside the article: With their love of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop, the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk. In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion \\"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\\"; Descendents \\"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys-inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\\". Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \\"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\\", can you guess it ?","completion":"The article does not provide the full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands.

Plot title: X-Men Origins: Wolverine Movie plot: In 1845, James Howlett, a boy living in Canada, witnesses his father being killed by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The trauma activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he kills Thomas, who reveals that he is James's real father. James flees along with Thomas's son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James defends Victor and the two are sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody, and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but the group's (especially Victor's) disregard for human life causes James to leave. Six years later, James (now using the name Logan) is working as a lumberjack in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero approach Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed, and he thinks someone is targeting the team's members. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, Logan realizes Victor is responsible. He finds him at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue, and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased, but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in.

ISDA PRESS REPORT - OCTOBER 23, 2001 CREDIT DERIVATIVES * ISDA clears way for Railtrack convertible delivery - IFR TRADING PRACTICE * Investment banks offer derivatives services to clients - Financial Times WEATHER DERIVATIVES * Every cloud...? - FOW ISDA clears way for Railtrack convertible delivery IFR - October 23, 2001 A UK lawyer retained by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association last Thursday advised that convertible bonds in their normal form meet the \\"not-contingent\\" clause of ISDA's standard credit derivatives definitions. This cleared the way for banks to accept delivery of Railtrack's ?400m 2009 convertible under existing default swaps. Around ?75m of convertibles had been delivered under default swap exercises by the close of trading on Friday. Although banks and other protection sellers will now realise some losses on acceptance of the Railtrack convertible, compared with accepting Railtrack's straight debt, the advice from Robin Potts QC was welcomed by the heads of credit derivatives at the major dealers. The legal opinion in effect removes one of the last main uncertainties about the enforceability of default swaps, and should allow increased sales of credit derivatives to convertible bond buyers. \\"The market has demonstrated its maturity,\\" said the head of credit derivatives trading at one bank. \\"All the major houses are now accepting convertibles as deliverables.\\" A London-based lawyer was chosen to provide the advice because the UK is the regime with the main legal question marks about deliverability of convertible bonds under default swap contracts, as well as the home of Railtrack. European convertibles typically feature a trustee with the responsibility to exercise conversion rights if a stock price moves a certain way beyond the strike price on a convertible bond. Banks had worried that this \\"widows and orphans\\" feature of convertible bonds could be interpreted to mean that the holder of a bond did not have full rights over its disposal, and that the deal would not therefore be deliverable under standard default swap language. The finding that convertibles are not contingent, whether they have a trustee or not, and therefore are deliverable under default swaps, unless specified otherwise, brought the price of the convertible bond closer to that of the cheapest to deliver of Railtrack's straight bonds, its S150m 2028 issue. The convertible had been trading as low as 80 early last week, while the 2028 bond had been trading around 90. By the close of trading on Friday, however, the convertible was priced at 84, bid only, while the 2028 bond was at 87.75/88.5. Assuming that default swap exercises were around these levels, the total cost to protection sellers of the Potts opinion would have been roughly ?3m, when comparing the cost of accepting ?75m of the convertible with delivery of the straight bond. This cost will rise slightly, as the gap between the prices of the convertible and the straight issue is likely to narrow further before more exercises are completed. Bank derivatives heads generally view the short-term cost as negligible compared with the benefit of some assurance that convertibles are deliverable. The advice from Potts does not carry the same weight as a court judgement, but as the price of the convertible has appreciated, there is little chance that an end investor in a synthetic securitisation or credit-linked note will mount a legal challenge to try to stop a bank from accepting delivery of the convertible. The banks that arrange these structured trades normally have the responsibility for handling any default swap exercises on the credits included. ISDA will soon unveil new detailed guidance on credit derivatives written on convertible debt, including the zerocoupon bonds that have been a major feature of issuance this year. Investment banks offer derivatives services to clients Financial Times - October 23, 2001 By John Labate JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are the latest firms to offer new derivatives services to their clients. The two investment banks are expected to announce the first licensing agreements today with Longitude, a Manhattan-based online derivatives platform that will also launch today. The agreements give both firms exclusive licenses to offer derivatives trading in a unique series of products. Derivative services allow companies and other institutions to offset the risks that are inherent in a number of their investments or commercial activities. Traditionally, the risks that have been hedged have been limited to things traded already, such as stocks, bonds or currencies. Longitude was founded in 1999 and offers a service to run auction-based hedging services for \\"events of economic significance that cannot be hedged currently in the derivatives markets\\", according to chief executive Andrew Lawrence. Mr Lawrence, a former hedge fund executive, says in its initial phase, the company will offer JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank clients derivatives and risk management services for economic statistics. In the near term, other derivatives services will be launched through Longitude to hedge the weather, equity prices, mortgage payments data, central bank target rates, and to cover other areas. JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank did not state the amounts of their spending for their licenses or the length of those contracts with Longitude. \\"This differentiates us as a provider of cutting-edge derivatives products,\\" said Chris Harvey, managing director at JP Morgan. \\"There is no direct mechanism in the capital markets for clients to take views or hedge exposure to underlying economic variables.\\" Longitude's founders designed the system to simulate auction systems where prices were set without the need to match buyers and sellers in the market. The system is similar to betting that occurs at horse tracks, where the prices are based on all \\"bets\\". Once the hedged event occurs, the many separate claims are paid from the hedges placed in the system. Every cloud...? FOW - October 2001 It would have been tempting, in 1997, to believe that the art of financial risk management had reached a zenith. That was the year innovative energy companies demonstrated that derivatives could be used to hedge the financial impact of one of the most powerful and unpredictable variables confronting business managers - Mother Nature. According to the US Department of Commerce, at least 1 trillion of the US economy is sensitive to the vagaries of the weather, including vast portions of the energy, manufacturing, retailing, tourism and agriculture industries. Yet it was only with the development of weather derivatives that companies gained the ability to protect their financial results from significant but non-catastrophic weather events such as excessive heat, precipitation or wind risks that few traditional insurance policies could efficiently cover. Today, it is clear that the trading of the world's first weather derivative - a temperature collar executed between Koch Industries and Enron - marked the dawn of a new era in risk management, not the crowning of an old one. It signaled the creation of a trading market fundamentally more efficient than insurance, which, after all, requires insurers to retain their clients' risk and to charge a risk premium for providing that service. A trading market, by contrast, matches principals on either side of a risk, eliminating the need for a risk premium. The result is a less costly, more efficient means of risk transfer. Not surprisingly, companies whose financial results are sensitive to the weather have been flocking to this new market. The cumulative notional value of all weather derivatives executed since 1997 exceeds 7.5 billion. Meanwhile, leading-edge traders are continuing to develop a seemingly endless stream of new products that give companies the opportunity to hedge all sorts of risks once considered unmanageable, from advertising costs to river flows. However, it is obvious that this new market still confronts numerous challenges. Whole industries need to be educated in the use and value of derivatives. Governments in the US and abroad must be shown that market-oriented solutions to risk management can be more effective, and more efficient for consumers, than regulatory solutions. (Some US regulators still allow utilities to recoup the cost of bad weather from their ratepayers through inefficient weather normalisation clauses, for example.) In some regions of the world and some market niches, data for indices that underlie these new products must become more rigorously standardised and more widely available. Despite these challenges, the opportunities are nearly limitless. The past half-decade has shown that nearly any high-volume product, service or business variable that can be measured can be commoditised, and that anything that can be commoditised can be traded. Enron began proving this idea in 1989, when deregulation of the natural gas industry was forcing companies to change the way they contracted for gas in the wholesale market. That year, Enron executed the world's first natural-gas swap to meet the needs of a customer that wanted to lock in a fixed price for its gas purchases. To make the deal work, Enron agreed to absorb the cost, or benefit, of monthly spot gas purchases tied to a published index. Five years after creating what would become the precursor to today's wholesale gas trading business, Enron began migrating its gas trading expertise into other markets, beginning with electrical power. In 1997, it completed the world's first weather trade. Two years later, the company's newly formed Enron Broadband Services unit debuted its Enron Intelligent Network, an Internet application delivery platform, that later led to Enron's first bandwidth trade. That year also marked the launch of EnronOnline. There, companies can buy and sell a vast array of physical commodities and related derivatives contracts in markets as diverse as natural gas; power; emission allowances; bandwidth; weather derivatives; NGLs, petrochemicals and plastics; coal; crude oil; pulp and paper; credit derivatives; shipping; steel and metals. However, the idea of hedging risk with derivatives is not a new one. As early as the 12th century, vendors at European trade fairs were signing contracts for future delivery of goods. Futures contracts were part of tulip mania in Holland in the early 1600s. In that same century, the Japanese created a futures market in rice at Dojima, near Osaka, to protect sellers from bad weather or warfare. In 17868, the Chicago Board of Trade began trading wheat, pork belly and copper futures. Today, the range of commodities and risks that can be traded are limited only by imagination and determination. The weather market A closer look at the development of the weather market illustrates the opportunity. According to a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Weather Risk Management Association, the number of weather contracts executed in the 12 months ended April 14, 2001 rose by 1150/0, to 2,759, from the comparable year-earlier period. While the total notional value of weather derivatives traded during that time declined 17%, to 2.5 billion, the downturn appears to have been a consequence of happenstance - in this case, mild temperatures during the winters of 1997, 1998 and 1999 in North America, where more than 95% of all contracts were executed. Those temperate winters, the survey managers theorise, likely caused buyers of temperature-related weather derivatives to demand less protection against the possibility of an unusually cold winter in 2000. While temperature-related weather contracts remain, for the moment, the most popular type of weather derivative, there are signs that the market is broadening. While temperature-linked contracts accounted for 98.30/0 of all contracts traded during the first three and-a-half years of the market's development, for example, contracts linked to other measures accounted for 7.2% of all contracts written during the six months ended April 14, 2001. We can expect this broadening of the market to continue as new products give companies the power to more precisely hedge their risks. Prime examples introduced recently include power demand swaps and cross-commodity options. Demand swaps are designed to overcome one of the biggest pitfalls of weather derivatives: they can protect companies against swings in demand -either for","completion":"The subject line for this email could be: \\"ISDA News and Updates: Credit Derivatives, Trading Practices, and Weather Derivatives - October 23, 2001\\" This email talks about news and updates related to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).

Compare the sentence structure: - Sentence 1: As the date for the executions of the three Quakers - Evangelists, Mary Dyer, Marmaduke Stephenson and William Robinson - 27 October 1659 was set. - Sentence 2: The date for the executions of the three Quakers - Evangelists , William Robinson , Marmaduke Stephenson and Mary Dyer - was set on 27 October 1659. The structure of both sentences is different, but the subject and predicate are the same. Sentence 1 uses \\"As\\" at the beginning, making it a dependent clause, and the date (27 October 1659) is placed directly before the predicate. Sentence 2, on the other hand, is an independent clause and has the date placed after the predicate. 3. Assess if the meaning is the same: Both sentences convey the same information: the date for the executions of the three Quakers, Evangelists Mary Dyer, Marmaduke Stephenson, and William Robinson, was set for 27 October 1659. The difference in structure does not change the meaning. Conclusion: Yes, these two sentences mean the same, despite the differences in their structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Article: Do you like listening to music? Does all of the music bring happiness to you? Do you know some music is noise? What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit of measure called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs when you are working in a noisy environment. Ear muffs for human can protect against noise pollution. Question: According to the passage, noise is .

Read this article and answer this question In a thrilling back and forth affair, the Patriots managed a sensational comeback against the undefeated Saints. Following the opening kickoff, Brady put together a 14-play 60-yard drive. The Patriots drove to the Saints 12, but on 3rd-and-7 Tom Brady was sacked for a 5-yard loss forcing them to settle for Stephen Gostkowski's 35-yard field goal to take the opening lead 3-0. The Saints went 3-and-out on their opening drive and the Patriots followed that with a 3-and-out of their own. The Saints responded by marching 73 yards taking over five minutes off the clock with Drew Brees tossing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Travaris Cadet. The Patriots immediately responded by slowly moving 80 yards to take a 10-7 lead on Stevan Ridley's 1-yard touchdown run. The Saints went 3-and-out yet again on their next drive and the Patriots took advantage with a long drive taking up 4:52 seconds in 12 plays as they marched 69 yards to increase their lead to 17-7 on another Stevan Ridley touchdown run, this one from 4 yards out. Punts filled the&#160;!of the half and the Patriots led 17-7 at halftime. The Saints took the opening kickoff of the second half 70 yards to the Patriots 10, but the Patriots kept them out of the end zone and Garrett Hartley kicked a 28-yard field goal to trim the lead 17-10. After a Patriots 3-and-out, the Saints stormed 67 yards with Khiry Robinson rushing for a 3-yard touchdown to suddenly tie the game at 17. The Patriots managed to respond on the follow-up drive marching 54 yards in 12 plays, but settled for Gostkowski's 54-yard field goal to retake the lead 20-17. Early in the fourth quarter on 3rd-and-12, the Drew Brees called a timeout to avoid delay of game, but the referees didn't see it so Brees was forced to snap the ball. Brees forced a pass intended for Jimmy Graham, but was by Kyle Arrington at the Saints 25 and returned for 5 yards to the Saints 20. The Patriots managed to reach the Saints 5-yard line, but were kept out of the end zone and Gostkowski kicked a 23-yard field goal to increase th Patriots lead to 23-17. The Saints immediately responded by storming 81 yards in 5:05 with Brees connecting with Kenny Stills on a 34-yard touchdown pass on 3rd-and-20, giving the Saints their second lead of the night 24-23. Four straight incompletions from Brady on the next drive seemingly ended the game, but the Patriots held the Saints to only three yards and Hartley kicked a 39-yard field goal to increase the lead to 27-23. Brady threw a seemingly game deciding interception with just 2:16 remaining but once again, the Patriots defense managed to hold the Saints to a 3-and-out (mostly due to the Saints erratic play calling). Brady got the ball back at his own 30 with 1:13 remaining and no timeouts, and mounted his 39th career game-winning drive. Tom Brady hit Edelman for 23 yards on the first play to move the ball to the Saints 47. He then completed passes to Austin Collie for 15 yards and Aaron Dobson for 6 yards moving the ball to the Saints 26-yard line with 0:35 seconds left. Back-to-back incompletions set up a 4th-and-4. Brady completed a pass to Collie again for 9 yards. Brady spiked the ball at the 17 with&#160;:10 seconds remaining. On the very next play, Brady connected with Thompkins for a 7-yard touchdown pass with five seconds remaining on the clock giving the Patriots the 30-27 lead. The Saints attempted a hook-and-lateral on the kickoff, but Darren Sproles fumbled and Jamie Collins recovered to end the game. The win (his 28th comeback win and 40th game-winning 4th quarter drive) was also his first in four tries against a Drew Brees-quarterbacked team.

This corresponds to an annual growth rate of 1.4% , well above the world average of 0.9% .The population of Western Asia is estimated at about 4% of world population, up from about 39 million at the beginning of the 20th century, or about 2% of world population at the time. The most populous countries in the region are Turkey and Iran and, each with around 79 million people, followed by Iraq and Saudi Arabia with around 33 million people each. Numerically, Western Asia is predominantly Arab, Persian, Turkish, and the dominating languages are correspondingly Arabic, Persian and Turkish, each with of the order of 70 million speakers, followed by smaller communities of Kurdish, Azerbaijani, Hebrew, Armenian and Eastern Aramaic. The dominance of Arabic and Turkish is the result of the medieval Arab and Turkic invasions beginning with the Islamic conquests of the 7th century AD, which displaced the formerly dominant Aramaic and Hebrew in the Levant, and Greek in Anatolia, although Hebrew is once again the dominant language in Israel, and Aramaic and Greek both remain present in their respective territories as minority languages. Other significant native minorities include Assyrians, Druze, Jews, Mandeans, Maronites, Shabaks, Syriac Arameans, Lurs and Yezidis.

Context: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November.

Article: When can I get a cell phone?\\" The answer is when your parents think you need one, though many kids seem to be getting them around age 12 or 13. Some younger kids may have them because their parents see it as a matter of safety and convenience. For example, a kid can call mom and dad when sports practice is over. And a cell phone can give kids almost instant access to their parents if something goes wrong or they need help. It can give parents quick access to their kids so they can check on them and make sure they're OK. If you do get a cell phone, make some rules with your parents, such as how many minutes you're allowed to spend on the phone, when you can use your phone, when the phone must be turned off, and what you will do if someone calls you too often, and so on. You'll also have to learn to take care of the phone in your life. Keep it charged and store it in the safe place so it doesn't get lost. And whatever you do, don't use it in the bathroom.

Turns out, some things are worth waiting for. Will audiences show up for 'Rock of Ages'? I don't know how much they may have finessed his vocal tracks, and it doesn't matter. He owns \\"Rock of Ages,\\" an addled tribute to '80s hair metal, from the very minute he appears. He emerges hazily from underneath layers of discarded groupies in a palatial hotel suite, sporting gunslinger body art and outrageous crotch jewelry, dispensing intensely eccentric, deeply fried philosophical nuggets before stumbling into the indoor Jacuzzi. Ladies and gents, meet Stacee Jaxx, God of Rock. A caricature of already larger-than-life personalities Axl Rose and Steven Tyler, Stacee is very much a supporting character in Chris D'Arienzo's Tony-award-winning 2009 musical. But he's also the star of the show, the one everybody else is dying to see, to make or to emulate. Cruise has the charisma to sell all that even as he shows us a boozed-up captive to celebrity, sex and ego. When he does perform, he's electric. However, Cruise is just as good in the dialogue scenes, whether it's messing with club owner Alec Baldwin's vulnerable brain or fending off an increasingly hot-under-the-collar \\"Rolling Stone\\" features writer (Malin Akerman).

Instead, she finds herself playing out a PG-13 version of \\"Showgirls,\\" waiting tables at the legendary rock club the Bourbon Room and falling in love with a co-worker, Drew (Diego Boneta). Drew's own singing aspirations get considerably more screen time than Sherrie's, but he still fails to make much impact. Hilariously, within hours of meeting her, he claims to have been inspired to write \\"Don't Stop Believin.\\" \\"It goes on and on,\\" he explains modestly after giving her a taste of the first verse.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The risk of having a first-time blood clot (VTE) is 100 in 100,000. However, that risk goes up exponentially as we age: by age 80, the rate of VTE is 500 in 100,000. As you get older, it’s important to monitor your overall health with regular medical checkups. Recent surgery or a broken bone in your hips or legs increases your risk of blood clots. Those who lead a sedentary or inactive lifestyle are at higher risk of pulmonary embolism, or a blood clot in the lungs. People who sit more than six hours a day in their leisure time are twice as likely to have pulmonary embolism of those sit for less than two hours. Prolonged periods of lying, sitting, or standing in one place can cause blood stasis, leading to clots. This is one reason why VTE is so common in hospitalized patients, especially after surgery, and people traveling long distances. People who fall in to the obese category have a much higher risk of VTE than those in a healthy weight range. The correlation is not completely understood, but experts believe at least part of it is due to the estrogen produced by fat cells. Estrogen is an independent risk factor for blood clots. Fat cells also produce proteins called “cytokines,” which may play a role in formation of VTE. Though not always the case, the obese may also lead more sedentary lives than those who fall into healthier weight ranges. To calculate your BMI, use an online BMI calculator, like the one on the Mayo Clinic website. You will need to input your age, height, weight, and sex for your results. An obese person will have a BMI of 30 or more. The overweight range is from 25-29.9, and normal from 18.5 to 24.9. Anything below 18.5 is considered underweight. Hormonal shifts, especially those involving estrogen, can put people at risk of VTE. This is often seen in postmenopausal women who take estrogen supplements as part of hormone replacement therapy. Women who take hormonal contraception to prevent pregnancy and those who are pregnant are also at risk. Before beginning any hormone therapy, discuss the risks and your options with your doctor. Coagulation is just another word for clotting, which is a normal process for your blood. Without it, you would bleed to death if you cut yourself! While coagulation is normal, hypercoagulation is when the blood clots too much, even when it's still in the body. Hypercoagulation can be caused by long periods of sitting or lying down, cancer, dehydration, smoking, and hormone therapies. You are at risk of hypercoagulation if: You have a family history of abnormal blood clots. You personally had a blood clot at young age. You had blood clots during pregnancy. You've suffered from multiple unexplained miscarriages. Some genetic disorders, such as Factor 5 Leiden Disorder or Lupus Anticoagulant, can also cause this condition. Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and the build up of cholesterol plaques in your arteries can all lead to blood clots. If you have atrial fibrillation, your blood isn't flowing properly, and may pool and begin to clot. People with atrial fibrillation may notice an irregular pulse but no other symptoms; it is usually discovered during routine check-ups. It can be treated with blood thinners or other medications, lifestyle changes, and in some cases a pacemaker or surgery. Waxy cholesterol plaques can build up in your arteries (sometimes as part of atherosclerosis) and, if the plaques break, they can begin the clotting process. Most heart attacks and strokes occur when plaque in your heart or brain bursts.","completion":"This article is about how the risk of blood clots increases as we age, with factors like recent surgery, broken bones, inactivity, obesity, and hormonal shifts increasing the chances of blood clots, and how to prevent them with regular checkups and a healthy lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Formula One may be entering a new era in 2014 but the Mercedes and Ferrari teams chose to pay homage to the man who remains the benchmark for the sport on the first day of pre-season testing. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, who finished his career with Mercedes in 2012, remains in hospital in a medically-induced coma after a skiing accident at the end of December. The new Mercedes car -- the first 2014 car out on track Tuesday at the Jerez circuit in Spain -- ran with the message \\"Keep Fighting Michael,\\" on its silver livery. The Ferrari team, who Schumacher raced for between 1996 and 2006, also showed their support for their five-time world champion in Spain. On the eve of the first day of winter testing, the team's crew posed with a pit board showing the message \\"Forza Michael\\" while the new F14-T scarlet racer made its track debut in Jerez with the same words of encouragement. Ferrari plan to post 72 messages of support for Schumacher on their website to represent each of his wins with the Italian team. On Tuesday, the team published a note from Niki Lauda, who won two world championships for Ferrari in the 1970s, which read: \\"Michael, every day I follow your improvements and every day I am close to you. I hope I can speak to you very, very soon!\\" Schumacher is stable but remains in a coma at the Grenoble hospital as he fights the effects of a serious head injury, sustained in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on 29 December. His family have said the messages of support have given them strength but they have also asked for privacy from the clamoring media interest in his condition. Many dedicated motorsport journalists have turned their attention to Jerez, where 10 of the 11 F1 teams are due to trial their new look cars on track and put this season's major rule changes to the test. Sebastian Vettel, with the help of new Australian teammate Daniel Ricciardo, unveiled the new Red Bull that he hopes will power him to a fifth straight world title. \\"The car looks very different,\\" Vettel told reporters. \\"There's a lot going on, the technology behind it is very complex.\\" F1 has ripped up the rulebook for the 2014 season, which opens with the Australian Grand Prix on 16 March. The 2014 F1 rule changes explained. The cars are now powered by 1.6-liter V6 turbo engines which also rely on a greater use of hybrid energy -- recovered through braking and from the car's exhaust gases. The unveiling of thinner, lower nose cones and narrower front wings, to comply with new design rules, has also raised eyebrows. With so many major changes, Red Bull team boss Christian Horner, speaking to the media in Spain, warned: \\"I think it's dangerous sometimes to be over confident that you have all the elements in place for the start of any season. \\"We've enjoyed great continuity over the last few years - we've got a strong driver lineup, we've got a strong tech lineup, we've got great strength in depth. \\"But you can't take anything for granted - Formula One, like any sport, can be unpredictable at times.\\" At the end of the opening day of the test, Vettel had ticked off just three laps in his brand new Red Bull and did not set a fastest time. \\"It was difficult to get an impression of what the new car is like,\\" Vettel told reporters. \\"We weren't quite ready this morning and things took a little bit longer than expected. It was impossible to get a feeling for it today.\\" Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, didn't get to take his McLaren out of the garage for a spin after the team's progress was hampered by electrical issues. Ferrari set the fastest time of the day with their returning 2007 world champion, Kimi Raikkonen, at the helm just outpacing the Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton, who set a lap time of one minute 27.80 seconds. \\"From a driving point of view, I didn't feel any amazing difference, although it's much too early to give an opinion on this,\\" Raikkonen told the Ferrari website. \\"Overall, we can say it was a good start.\\" Hamilton was also pleased with his first day at work, despite crashing his Mercedes after just 18 laps. The team later explained that the car had a front wing problem.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Relationships must be nurtured to survive. Social support is essential for your physical and psychological health.If you’ve been handcuffed to the news for any period of time, your relationships have likely suffered. Reach out to others to build or repair your relationships. Until you are 100% confident with the changes you have made, you will need the support of others. Engage in real and online social situations that expand your interests beyond news stories. For example, take a music lesson, volunteer for a project to help animals, or children in need. It will restore the idea that there is more to life than news. Shared interests bring people together. Investigate and join a group that might interest you. There might be a comedy groups, or city recreation league that will provide the opportunity to meet new people. If you meet someone who you suspect is addicted to the news, refrain from talking about the news. Bring up different subjects to divert the conversation toward a more positive direction. You can always excuse yourself from a conversation if it becomes difficult or annoying. Without being pushy or overbearing, share your experience with the person and offer to help him. You can suggest all the strategies that helped you manage your addiction to the news. Teaching others what you have learned will give you a sense of accomplishment and internal reward far above what watching the news will provide. Learning to overcome and manage an addiction to the news will increase your self-esteem. It is important to keep the information we hear in perspective. A lot of news narrows down the information to a specific, terrible situation. There are usually time constraints so they pack in as much death and destruction as possible. If you inundate yourself with this information, it will skew your perception of reality. Pause and think clearly and you will realize the chances of the same disaster happening again or even at all, are minuscule. Influenza is a very good example of narrow reporting. A certain amount of people die, but in a country with 350 million people, 50 influenza deaths is a small amount. Don't assume there is a pandemic without good evidence. When you're tempted to believe that things are getting worse because of the news, stop and ask yourself something like: Are they really? And why do I think that? Are those facts credible? Taking the time to question the fear-mongering news stories can break the cycle of being obsessed with them. Watch movies or TV shows that don’t involve the news or disasters. For example, you can watch shows about home improvement, or biographies of historical figures. Add some humor to your life to balance the negativity of watching the news. It can be healing. Periodically ask yourself if you have laughed very much in the last week or month. If you can't remember the last time you did, then find a way to get a good dose of laughter. Call a friend who makes you laugh, or go to a comedy club to support comedians. Once you feel the benefits of laughter you will make it part of your routine. Life is filled with things that challenge you, and also make you want to celebrate. Much of life happens between those two points. You are able to appreciate the celebratory moments because you know what it feels like to struggle. If you are feeling down you can feel confident that the good will eventually arrive.

Fred studied bird reproduction this semester, while Dan studied fish reproduction. Which friend studied less about female fish increasing the chances of fertilization? Hint: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.","completion":"Based on the information provided, Dan studied fish reproduction, and Fred studied bird reproduction. Since fish reproduce sexually and release a high number of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization, the friend who studied less about female fish increasing the chances of fertilization would be Fred. Fred's focus was on bird reproduction, which is different from fish reproduction. Birds have internal fertilization, and the female lays fertilized eggs. The reproductive strategies of birds do not involve releasing high numbers of eggs into the surrounding environment to increase the chances of fertilization, as seen in fish reproduction. In contrast, Dan studied fish reproduction and learned about the various strategies in which fish reproduce, including releasing large numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. His studies likely covered the reproductive behavior and fertilization processes of different fish species and their unique adaptations to improve fertilization success.

Analyze the first sentence: \\"Gossip is a malicious poison.\\" In this sentence, \\"poison\\" is used metaphorically to describe gossip. The metaphor implies that gossip has a harmful and negative effect on people, similar to the damaging impact of a literal poison. Here, \\"poison\\" refers to something toxic and detrimental. 2. Analyze the second sentence: \\"The poison of fascism.\\" In this sentence, \\"poison\\" is also used metaphorically. It describes the harmful effects or negative influence of fascism. Similar to the first sentence, \\"poison\\" in this context refers to something detrimental and harmful. Justification: In both sentences, the word \\"poison\\" is used metaphorically to describe something harmful and negative. Although the subjects are different (gossip and fascism), the usage of \\"poison\\" is consistent in both sentences.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the first white artist to chart the first house record in the U.S. ? Many independent Chicago-based record labels were also getting their artists on the dance charts. Detroit DJ Terrence Parker uses his advanced turntablism skills and his focus on precision to blend hip hop music DJing styles, such as rhythmic scratching, in his house mixes. Fellow Detroit spinner DJ Minx is a notable woman house DJ. Her records on her Women on Wax label blend Parker-influenced turntablism precision with a funky style. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a \\"must-play\\" at UK house music clubs. Paradise Garage in New York City was still a top club in the house era, just as it had been during the disco age. The emergence of Todd Terry, a pioneer of the genre, demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco approach which moved to a new house sound. Terry's cover of Class Action's \\"Weekend\\" (mixed by Larry Levan) shows how Terry drew on newer hip-hop influences, such as the quicker sampling and the more rugged basslines. In the late 1980s, Nu Groove Records launched and nurtured the careers of Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell, collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via Timmy Regisford and Frank Mendez). Nu Groove also had a stable of other NYC underground scene DJs. The Burrell's created the \\"New York Underground\\" sound of house, and they did 30+ releases on this label featuring this sound.

Louise, having passionately stood by Gittany throughout the trial, has stated her plans to write a script detailing the events of the case in an attempt to clear his name. Lisa Harnum's tragic death shook the nation, with the young model falling to her death from the 15th floor of a luxury apartment building in Sydney back in July 2011. Gittany was immediately suspected of foul play, and subsequent investigations led to his arrest and subsequent charge. Throughout the trial, Gittany maintained that Harnum's death was an accident, arguing that she had lost her balance and fallen from the balcony while attempting to climb down. Despite Gittany's protestations, the court found him guilty of murder in a unanimous decision, with overwhelming evidence pointing to his role in Harnum's untimely demise. The trial showcased alarming details of the couple's turbulent relationship, with the prosecution arguing that Gittany was a possessive and controlling partner. Evidence presented during the trial included CCTV footage of Gittany dragging an apparently terrified Harnum back inside their apartment shortly before her death. This verdict has devastating implications for Gittany's current girlfriend, Rachelle Louise, who has been steadfast in her belief in his innocence. Louise was visibly distraught during the reading of the verdict, fleeing the court in tears as the reality of Gittany's conviction set in. Louise has stated her intention to write a script about the case in a bid to offer a different perspective on the harrowing events that led to Harnum's death. While Rachelle Louise's loyalty to Gittany is unwavering, many have speculated on the nature of their relationship, drawing parallels between his relationship with the late Lisa Harnum and his current connection with Louise. The parallels between these two relationships have only fueled public interest in the case and only strengthened calls for justice for Harnum. Simon Gittany's sentencing hearing is scheduled to take place in February, with the grisly details of this trial expected to heavily influence the final sentencing. As the nation awaits the conclusion of this disturbing case, the repercussions of Gittany's conviction continue to send shockwaves throughout Australia. In the midst of this tragic tale of love gone devastatingly wrong, Gittany's conviction will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on the lives of all those involved. As Rachelle Louise writes her script, only time will tell if her steadfast belief in Simon Gittany's innocence can bring forth any new evidence or simply remain a gesture by a devoted partner desperate to cling to the memory of a love that now seems forever tarnished."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Common acts of defiance include pretending children are younger to pay cheaper entrance fees and sticking chewing gum to surfaces. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The Impact of \\"Being in a Rush\\" Culture: Trivializing Laws and Rules in Everyday Life Introduction A recent study has revealed the troubling trend of individuals contravening laws and rules on a daily basis. The hectic pace of modern life, combined with the urge for convenience and the desire to save both time and money, has led many to adopt a lax approach towards upholding societal regulations. This 'being in a rush' mentality appears to have driven the average Brit to knowingly flout at least five rules per week, amounting to an incredible 16,250 breaches during a person's lifetime. Even though these acts might seem minor and innocuous at first glance, they contribute to the erosion of a collective adherence to laws and rules that form the basis of a well-functioning society. Common examples of these transgressions include providing false information about a child's age to pay reduced entrance fees, sticking chewing gum to public surfaces, and committing minor traffic offenses. This article aims to examine the prevalence of such behaviors and their underlying causes while also discussing how they affect society and ways to combat them. 1. The Psychology Behind Breaking Rules One significant factor that contributes to the disregard for rules is the general attitude that \\"everyone else is doing it.\\" With the widespread normalization of such behaviors, people may feel less guilty about their own participation in rule-breaking. This, in turn, reinforces the notion that violating minor rules and laws is not as serious or harmful, effectively trivializing their importance. Another reason lies in the inherent drive for convenience. In a fast-paced society, individuals often seek shortcuts to save time and effort, especially when there appears to be no immediate consequences for their actions. The seemingly low probability of being caught and the negligible perceived impact of their actions may further entice people to push the envelope when it comes to rule-breaking. 2. The Ripple Effects of Disregarding Rules Although these breaches may appear inconsequential, they have a cumulative effect on society at large. When multiple individuals disregard laws and regulations, it can create an environment where anti-civic and improper behavior is not only commonplace but also implicitly accepted. This sets a dangerous precedent that undermines societal values and cohesion. In addition, the reliance on shortcuts to save time and money contributes to the emergence of unethical practices. When one person seeks an advantage by bending the rules, others may feel compelled to follow suit in order to keep up. This dynamic creates a vicious cycle in which small transgressions escalate, as everyone strives to maintain their competitive edge in various aspects of life, both personal and professional. 3. Encouraging Positive Change Holding individuals accountable for their actions is fundamental to combating widespread rule-breaking and fostering an environment where laws and regulations are respected. Law enforcement, educational institutions, and workplaces must actively implement measures to discourage rule-breaking behavior. Promoting transparency, encouraging civic responsibility, and reinforcing the social consequences of unethical decision-making are important aspects of this approach. Moreover, motivating people to recognize that adherence to rules and laws, even seemingly minor ones, is critical to ensuring that society functions efficiently and fairly. Public awareness campaigns, educational initiatives, and community events can underline the value of ethical behavior. Individuals should also be encouraged to challenge the notion that such breaches are harmless and that everyone must do their part to curb the prevalence of rule-breaking. Conclusion The 'being in a rush' mentality has significant consequences for the stability of our society and must be addressed. The widespread casual disregard for laws and regulations is indicative of a larger problem, wherein convenience and personal gain supersede a sense of civic duty. Reversing this trend requires concerted efforts spanning law enforcement, education, public awareness, and individual commitment. It is only through the collective enforcement of societal norms and values that we can maintain a strong sense of community and social cohesion. Ultimately, instilling the importance of ethical behavior from a young age and challenging the normalization of rule flouting is essential to ensuring a better future for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. - The Scandinavian Peninsula (; \\"Skandinavsky poluostrov\\") is a peninsula in Northern Europe, which generally comprises the mainland of Sweden, the mainland of Norway (with the exception of a small coastal area bordering Russia), the northwestern area of Finland, as well as a narrow area in the west of the Pechengsky District of Russia. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German). - Vest-Agder \\"(West Agder)\\" is a county in Norway, bordering Rogaland to the west and Aust-Agder to the east. In 2002 there were 157,851 inhabitants, which is 3.4% of the total population in Norway. Its area is . The county administration, and largest city is Kristiansand. - Rogaland is a county in Western Norway, bordering Hordaland, Telemark, Aust-Agder, and Vest-Agder counties. Rogaland is the center of the Norwegian petroleum industry. In 2016, Rogaland had an unemployment rate of 4.9%, one of the highest in Norway. In 2015, Rogaland had a fertility rate of 1.78 children per woman, which is the highest in the country. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, Sørlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot. - Haugaland or Haugalandet is a traditional district situated on the western coast of Norway. Haugaland is one of the 15 traditional districts located within the Vestlandet region. - Western Norway is the region along the Atlantic coast of southern Norway. It consists of the counties Rogaland, Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane, and Møre og Romsdal. The region has a population of approximately 1.3 million people. The largest city is Bergen and the second-largest is Stavanger. Historically the regions of Agder, Vest-Telemark, Hallingdal, Valdres and northern parts of Gudbrandsdal have been included in Western Norway. - Peter I Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals. - Kvitsøy is an island municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. At only , it is the smallest municipality in Norway by area. Kvitsøy is located in the traditional district of Ryfylke. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Ydstebøhamn on the island of Kvitsøy. The municipality is an archipelago located at the entrance to the large Boknafjorden. It sits about northwest of the mainland Stavanger peninsula. There are plans for the Rogfast tunnel to eventually connect Kvitsøy to the mainland road network. - Utsira is one of the smallest municipalities in Norway . The island municipality is located in northwestern Rogaland county , just off the western coast of Norway . Utsira is part of the traditional district of Haugaland . Utsira is the smallest municipality of Norway by population and it is the second smallest municipality by area ( after the nearby island municipality of Kvitsøy ) .

Utsira is located in the North Sea , about 18 kilometres ( 11 mi ) west of the town of Haugesund . All of the 206 residents ( as of 2015 ) live on the main island of Utsira , where the administrative centre and Utsira Church is located . - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, Västergötland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of Østfold, in Norway, to the north. - Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain.

Ryfylke is one of the 15 districts in Western Norway. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of... - Rogfast or the Rogaland Fixed Link is a planned sub-sea road tunnel between the municipalities of Randaberg (near the city of Stavanger) and Bokn in Rogaland county, Norway.

Stavanger's core is to a large degree 18th- and 19th-century wooden houses that are protected and considered part of the city's cultural heritage. This has caused the town centre and inner city to retain a small-town character with an unusually high ratio of detached houses, and has contributed significantly to spreading the city's population growth to outlying parts of Greater Stavanger. - Härjedalen is a historical province or \\"landskap\\" in the centre of Sweden.

Answer the following question. How did the famous American abolitionist John Brown die on December 2, 1859","completion":"John Brown, the famous American abolitionist, was a key figure in the turbulent years leading up to the American Civil War. He firmly believed that he was called upon by God to eradicate slavery in the United States, and thus took up arms to combat the institution. His militant and uncompromising stance culminated in the controversial harpers Ferry raid in October 1859. This action would ultimately lead to his capture, trial, and eventual execution on December 2, 1859. The Harper's Ferry raid was an armed insurrection led by Brown and his band of 21 accomplices (including several freed enslaved people and some of his own sons), with the intent of capturing the federal armory and arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now part of West Virginia). Brown believed that by seizing the weapons stored there, he could arm enslaved people in the region, instigating a widespread revolt against slaveholders. The raid began on October 16, 1859, when Brown's group attacked and overpowered the armory's guards. Despite initial success, the raid quickly unraveled as local militias and U.S. military forces, led by Colonel Robert E. Lee and J.E.B. Stuart, surrounded Brown and his men, who had retreated to the armory's engine house. After a two-day standoff, Lee's forces stormed the engine house on October 18, overpowering the insurgents, killing several of them, and capturing John Brown and his remaining accomplices. Following the raid, Brown and his captured followers were brought to Charles Town, Virginia (now in West Virginia) to stand trial on charges of treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, murder, and inciting a slave rebellion. During the trial, which lasted from October 27 to November 2, 1859, Brown defended himself and his actions passionately, asserting that his violent measures were necessary to combat the evil of slavery. The jury did not agree, and Brown was convicted on all counts. As a result of the trial, John Brown was sentenced to death by hanging. His execution took place on December 2, 1859, in Charles Town. As he stood on the gallows awaiting his fate, he handed his guards a note that read, \\"I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood.\\" Brown's actions and his subsequent death had a profound and polarizing effect on the public sentiment. In the North, Brown was regarded as a martyr who courageously fought against the evils of slavery—a view expressed in the famous \\"John Brown's Body\\" song. The South, on the other hand, saw Brown's actions as an act of terrorism, and his raid fueled further fear and anxiety over the prospect of a widespread rebellion among enslaved people. John Brown's death served to further heighten tensions between the North and the South, which led to a significant escalation in the agitation surrounding the issue of slavery. It contributed to the dissolution of the uneasy balance between the two regions, setting the stage for the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Given the below context: Sir William Turner Walton, OM (29 March 1902 – 8 March 1983) was an English composer. During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include Façade, the cantata Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems Crown Imperial and Orb and Sceptre. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD. Guess a valid title for it!

We have 126*y + 362 + 113 = 300 - 1085. Let us first combine the constant terms on each side of the equation: 126*y + (362 + 113) = 300 - 1085 Step 2: Calculate the sum of constant terms on the left-hand side. 362 + 113 = 475 Now, our equation becomes: 126*y + 475 = 300 - 1085 Step 3: Calculate the difference of constant terms on the right-hand side. 300 - 1085 = -785 Our equation is now: 126*y + 475 = -785 Step 4: Isolate the term with the variable y. Subtract 475 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with y: 126*y = -785 - 475 Step 5: Calculate the difference. -785 - 475 = -1260 Now, we have: 126*y = -1260 Step 6: Solve for y. To find the value of y, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is 126: y = (-1260) / 126 Step 7: Calculate the division. -1260 / 126 = -10 So, the solution for y is: y = -10"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

The current campus opened in 1916 and extends over along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. - MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) is a research institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology formed by the 2003 merger of the Laboratory for Computer Science and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Housed within the Stata Center, CSAIL is the largest on-campus laboratory as measured by research scope and membership. - Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electric power distribution and use. Subsequently, broadcasting and recording media made electronics part of daily life. The invention of the transistor, and later the integrated circuit, brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object. - Silvio Micali ( born October 13 , 1954 ) is an Italian - born computer scientist at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a professor of computer science in MIT 's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science since 1983 . His research centers on the theory of cryptography and information security . - Data integrity is the maintenance of, and the assurance of the accuracy and consistency of, data over its entire life-cycle, and is a critical aspect to the design, implementation and usage of any system which stores, processes, or retrieves data. The term \\"data integrity\\" is broad in scope and may have widely different meanings depending on the specific context even under the same general umbrella of computing. This article provides only a broad overview of some of the different types and concerns of data integrity. - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.

Nathan read the package of words in silence, his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages. Allan sat nervously across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself, a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period. At long last, Nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them. Allan leaned forward unconsciously. \\"It's the best story you've ever written.\\" Allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair, his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts. \\"So,\\" he asked, \\"you don't think it's a waste of ink and paper, a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery?\\" \\"Heavens, no,\\" said Nathan, aghast. \\"This is one of the strongest works I've read in ages.

Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him, then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face. He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right; although the man was somewhat peculiar, he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight. Certainly, it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them. His mind's strangest fruit had ripened at last, and he found the taste less bitter than expected.

We have: -7 * m - 72 * m = -146 * m - 1608 Now, we need to find the value of m (that's a secret number we're looking for). First, let's simplify the equation. When we see -7 * m and -72 * m, we can add them together. Just think of having -7 apples and then losing 72 more apples. In total, you would lose 79 apples, so we get: -79 * m = -146 * m - 1608 Next, we want to move all the m terms to one side of the equation, and the numbers to the other side. So, we'll add 146 * m to both sides of the equation: -79 * m + 146 * m = -1608 When we add -79 * m and 146 * m, we get: 67 * m = -1608 Now, we're really close to finding the secret number m! To find the value of m, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 67: m = -1608 ÷ 67 When we divide, we find out that: m = -24 So the secret number m we were looking for is -24!

Please answer this question: In which year did Burges and Maclean defect?","completion":"Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, members of the Cambridge Five spy ring, defected from the United Kingdom to the Soviet Union in 1951. Both of them were British diplomats and members of the Communist Party who passed critical information to the Soviets during and after World War II. Their defection is an important incident in the history of espionage as it revealed the existence of Soviet spies within the ranks of the British Secret Service. Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean officially defected to the Soviet Union on May 25, 1951. The pair had sensed that their cover was on the verge of being blown after British counter-intelligence chief Kim Philby had narrowly avoided being exposed as a Soviet spy in a similar investigation. Philby's suspect status led to further scrutiny of Burgess and Maclean, with Donald Maclean being the primary target of the investigation because cipher clerk and secret Soviet agent Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin tipped the British that a high-ranking diplomat was about to defect. In anticipation of their eventual exposure, the Soviet Union made plans for their extraction. The British intelligence agencies were closing in on the duo, and they managed to escape to France by boat just before their arrest. From France, the Soviet embassy arranged for their transportation to Moscow. They crossed Soviet-controlled East Germany and finally reached the Soviet Union in late June 1951. The defection of Burgess and Maclean further heightened the tensions between the West and the Soviet Union during the ongoing Cold War. Their espionage had provided crucial intelligence to the Soviets, which significantly impacted global politics and diplomacy during that time. The Cambridge Five spy ring also consisted of Kim Philby, Anthony Blunt, and John Cairncross. Collectively, they demonstrated that the Soviets had successfully infiltrated the British establishment, exposing vulnerabilities in the western counter-intelligence activities and prompting a need for increased security measures. In conclusion, the year when Burges and Maclean defected was 1951, and their actions greatly contributed to the distrust and tensions between the East and the West during the Cold War era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shankly began his managerial career at the club where his professional playing career had started. Carlisle in the 1948-49 season were struggling in the bottom half of the Third Division North and finding it difficult to attract southern-based players because of the town's geographic remoteness in the far north of England. Shankly's work ethic transformed the team who finished 15th in 1948-49 after he had been in charge for only the last few matches. They improved to ninth in 1949-50 and then to third in 1950-51, almost gaining promotion. One of Shankly's players at Carlisle was Geoff Twentyman, then a promising young centre half, who was later transferred to Liverpool. After he retired from playing, Twentyman became chief scout at Liverpool, working with Shankly and finding several outstandingly talented players. Shankly used psychology to motivate his players, for example telling them that the opposition had had a very tiring journey and were not fit to play the match. He urged the local population to support the team and would use the public address system at matches to tell the crowd about his team changes and how his strategy was improving the team. Shankly recalled that Brunton Park was dilapidated, writing that \\"the main stand (was) falling to pieces and the terraces derelict\\". He even burned all the kit. When the team was travelling to Lincoln City, he saw a sportswear shop in Doncaster and stopped the coach to buy a full set of kit in which the team played at Lincoln. Season ticket sales in 1950-51 reached an all-time high and Carlisle challenged strongly for promotion as well as achieving a draw with Arsenal at Highbury in the FA Cup. But it ended badly because Shankly accused the club's board of reneging on a bonus promise for the players should the team finish in the top-three. Shankly resigned and took up an offer from Grimsby Town. Shankly's overall record in league football at Carlisle was 42 wins and 22 defeats from 95 matches.

In the first sentence, \\"They were under the mentorship of Coach Glenn Capacio and Coach Norman Black,\\" the focus is on Coach Glenn Capacio and Coach Norman Black playing the role of mentors to the individuals they are coaching. Mentorship generally refers to a relationship in which a more experienced or knowledgeable person (the mentor) guides, supports, and helps the development of a less experienced or knowledgeable person (the mentee). In this case, the coaches are providing guidance, advice, and assistance to help the athletes improve their skills and knowledge. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"They were under the auspices of Coach Glenn Capacio and Coach Norman Black,\\" uses the term \\"auspices,\\" which is broader and typically implies sponsorship, protection, or guidance. It could be understood as the coaches overseeing or being responsible for the athletes, their progress, and overall well-being. It may involve more administrative or organizational roles that the coaches play in addition to their coaching responsibilities. Auspices may also imply the coaches having influence over decisions being made or resources allocated, which may not necessarily be components of a mentorship relationship. While mentorship and auspices can overlap to some extent, the main difference lies in the roles and functions assumed by the coaches in each case.

Mitt Romney has a roster of blue-chip GOP supporters here, more resources and a superior organization in a state that seems a good fit to his brand of Republicanism. Text Size - + reset And yet again, on primary eve, Illinois remains in play, with Rick Santorum seemingly within striking distance and the former Massachusetts governor’s local supporters more nervous than they should be about Tuesday’s outcome. Bob Michel, the former House GOP leader who served 19 terms in Congress representing Peoria, acknowledged that Romney has thus far failed to generate sufficient excitement to deliver a convincing knockout blow to Santorum in Illinois. “He’s not overwhelming, that’s the problem through the whole damn primary,” said Michel, who backed Romney in 2008 and again this cycle. “What’s the spark? What’s the thing that gets him off and running? No one knows.” Romney’s inability to lock down the Republican vote in the most populous of the Midwestern states is exemplified by former GOP Gov. Jim Edgar’s ambivalence toward him. The former two-term Illinois governor should be in Romney’s sweet spot: He’s a pro-business Republican who held statewide office for 18 years and sometimes faced trouble from more orthodox conservatives. But rather than backing Romney, Edgar is sitting out a Republican presidential race, he said, for the first time since getting into elective politics. “Romney just doesn’t get folks real excited,” Edgar told POLITICO. “It seems like he can get about 33 percent and just about hovers there.” A moderate in the tradition of successful statewide Republicans dating from Everett Dirksen to Thompson to Sen. Mark Kirk, Edgar said Romney’s tack to the right on a range of issues since becoming a national candidate leaves him vulnerable of blurring the lines between him and Santorum. In a state without formal party affiliation, where voters choose one party’s primary ballot at their precinct, Edgar said Romney may have cost himself support by wooing the GOP’s most conservative voters. “If he keeps moving to the right, I think he might be losing some people who are saying he’s not a whole lot different than Santorum,” Edgar said. “If Romney was kind of running with his governor of Massachusetts image, then he might get some Democrats and independents to come in and help him. But today, I don’t know.” Romney’s Illinois team — which has long expected to win the state — now has him campaigning here like a candidate scared. A Chicago Tribune/WGN poll taken March 7-9 showed Romney’s lead over Santorum at 4 percentage points, with Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul far behind, though a Public Policy Polling automated survey released Sunday evening gave Romney a more comfortable 15-point edge. ||||| Mitt Romney is headed for a blowout victory in Illinois on Tuesday. He leads with 45% to 30% for Rick Santorum, 12% for Newt Gingrich, and 10% for Ron Paul. Romney's particularly strong among voters who live in suburban areas (50-29) and with those who live in urban areas (46-23). But he's even running slightly ahead of Santorum, 38-36, with folks who identify as living in rural parts and that strength with a group of voters he hasn't tended to do that well with is why he's looking at such a lopsided margin of victory. Romney tends to win moderates in most states and Santorum usually win voters describing themselves as 'very conservative.' The swing group in the Republican electorate is those identifying as just 'somewhat conservative.' Romney is winning those folks by a whooping 60-20 margin in Illinois. Romney's also benefiting from a 52-28 advantage with seniors. ||||| WHEATON, Ill.—The Land of Lincoln once proved a reliable home for centrist Republicans, making it the kind of state Mitt Romney would have carried comfortably. Not anymore. The former Massachusetts governor finds himself locked in a dogfight here with former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum ahead of Tuesday's primary, thanks in part to the rising influence of more-conservative Republicans. Enlarge Image Close Getty Images Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann, are introduced at a pancake brunch Sunday at an American Legion post in Moline, Ill. GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney blasted former Senator Rick Santorum as an \\"economic lightweight\\" during a campaign stop in Illinois Sunday. Romney said the nation needs an \\"economic heavyweight\\" in order to turn the country around. (Video: NewsCore/Photo: Getty Images) In 2010, this shift to the right resulted in five new Republicans riding the tea-party wave to Congress from Illinois. The same year, a socially conservative candidate survived a crowded primary for governor only to lose in the general election to the Democratic protégé of jailed former Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Now, the development of a conservative power center in the party is being mirrored in the presidential race, as Messrs. Romney and Santorum barnstorm the state. Mr. Romney has touted his endorsements by Illinois elected officials—the treasurer and several House members among them, along with former House Speaker Denny Hastert—while Mr. Santorum has been trying to tap into the frustration that many conservative activists say they feel with party leaders. \\"All the Republican establishment, as you know, is lined up behind Romney,\\" Mr. Santorum told a crowd of roughly 2,000 at a rally Friday in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights. \\"Hopefully, the conservative voices here in the state will say that the best chance for us to beat Barack Obama is to have a clear choice,\\" he added, saying that Mr. Romney's policies were too similar to the president's. Mr. Romney campaigned in Moline on Sunday and focused on Mr. Obama, linking his policies to rising gas prices. Newt Gingrich campaigned in Illinois last week, as did Rep. Ron Paul. The influx of conservative activists has led to more infighting and produced mixed results for the party statewide. The House gains in the last election were offset by the GOP's failure to recapture the governorship, despite a wave of embarrassing political scandals for the Democrats. Republican Bill Brady, the most conservative candidate, eked out the nomination as his more centrist rivals split the vote, but he lost in the general election, in part because he had a record on social issues that soured suburban voters. \\"Illinois is a conservative state, but we're not a right-wing state,\\" said Republican former Gov. Jim Thompson. \\"Every time we elect a right-wing candidate for governor, they lose.\\" By contrast, Cynthia Schneider, a Santorum delegate from the Chicago suburb of Naperville, thinks the Republican establishment in the state remains far more moderate than the party as a whole. Mr. Romney finished second in the 2008 GOP primary in Illinois, though he was competing with another centrist in Sen. John McCain. The state's recent travails have provided ample fuel for Republicans here. Last year, Democrats in the statehouse approved a 66% increase in state income taxes to patch a looming budget shortfall. Even so, Moody's Investors Service dropped the state's credit rating earlier this year, to the lowest in the country. At the same time, the state continues to lose businesses to its neighbors, such as Indiana and Wisconsin, which actively court Illinois companies. The unemployment rate of 9.4% is one of the country's highest. \\"People are mad,\\" said Rep. Judy Biggert (R., Ill.), who represents the western suburbs of Chicago and supports Mr. Romney, saying he has the best plan to cut the deficit. \\"They're really focused on debt and government spending.\\" Others say the angriest voters are likely to back Mr. Santorum. Illinois hasn't played a major role in a Republican nominating contest since 1988, when voters here sided with then-Vice President George H.W. Bush over then-Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. Officials here say the presidential campaigns seem almost surprised that they have wound up competing in Illinois this year, and they see little evidence of robust get-out-the-vote operations. That could benefit Mr. Santorum, since conservative activists seem the most eager to vote and would carry more influence in a low-turnout election, Republican officials say. Turnout projections for Tuesday vary, however. Here in Wheaton, a Chicago suburb, yard signs touting primary contenders for various state and local offices clutter most busy arteries, but the names Romney and Santorum are conspicuously absent. Roughly three-quarters of all Republican votes in the state come from the Chicago area, which stretches far out from the city. But towns like Wheaton and nearby Naperville aren't on the itinerary of the two leading presidential candidates. \\"If I were running the campaigns, I would have fired someone by now,\\" said Patrick Durante, a Republican operative in this part of the state. \\"They clearly thought this thing would be wrapped up before Illinois.\\" Likewise, voters and local political operatives say the candidates have not devoted much time or money to phone calls or mail; instead, a super-PAC supporting Mr. Romney has spent nearly 2.5 million on television ads in the state, while a group supporting Mr. Santorum has spent roughly 300,000. Mr. Roskam said he didn't see much presence of either campaign during the two St. Patrick's Day parades he walked over the weekend in Republican-friendly DuPage County.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Janis Lyn Joplin (; January 19, 1943 - October 4, 1970) was an American rock singer and songwriter; one of the most successful and widely-known female rock stars of her era. After releasing three albums, she died of a heroin overdose at the age of 27. A fourth album, Pearl, was released in January 1971, just over three months after her death. Joplin appeared at Woodstock starting at approximately 2:00 a.m., on Sunday, August 17, 1969. Joplin informed her band that they would be performing at the concert as if it were just another gig. On Saturday afternoon, when she and the band were flown by helicopter with the pregnant Joan Baez and Baez's mother from a nearby motel to the festival site and Joplin saw the enormous crowd, she instantly became extremely nervous and giddy. Upon landing and getting off the helicopter, Joplin was approached by reporters asking her questions. She referred them to Caserta as she was too excited to speak. Initially Joplin was eager to get on the stage and perform, but was repeatedly delayed as bands were contractually obliged to perform ahead of Joplin. Faced with a ten-hour wait after arriving at the backstage area, Joplin shot heroin and drank alcohol with Caserta, and by the time of reaching the stage, Joplin was \\"three sheets to the wind\\". During her performance, Joplin's voice became slightly hoarse and wheezy, and she struggled to dance. Joplin pulled through, however, and engaged frequently with the crowd, asking them if they had everything they needed and if they were staying stoned. The audience cheered for an encore, to which Joplin replied and sang \\"Ball and Chain\\". Pete Townshend, who performed with the Who later in the same morning after Joplin finished, witnessed her performance and said the following in his 2012 memoir: \\"She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn't at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount of booze and heroin she'd consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible.\\" Janis remained at Woodstock for the remainder of the festival. Starting at approximately 3:00 a.m. on Monday, August 18, Joplin was among many Woodstock performers who stood in a circle behind Crosby, Stills & Nash during their performance, which was the first time anyone at Woodstock ever had heard the group perform with Neil Young. This information was published by David Crosby in 1988. Later in the morning of August 18, Joplin and Joan Baez sat in Joe Cocker's van and witnessed Hendrix's close-of-show performance, according to Baez's memoir And a Voice to Sing With (1989). Still photographs in color show Joplin backstage with Grace Slick the day after Joplin's performance, wherein Joplin appears to be very happy. Joplin was ultimately unhappy with her performance, however, and blamed Caserta. Her singing was not included (by her own insistence) in the 1970 documentary film or the soundtrack for Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More, although the 25th anniversary director's cut of Woodstock includes her performance of \\"Work Me, Lord\\". The documentary film of the festival that was released to theaters in 1970 includes, on the left side of a split screen, 37 seconds of footage of Joplin and Caserta walking toward Joplin's dressing room tent. Was her singing not included because she was not happy with her performance at woodstock?","completion":"Yes, sweetie, Janis Joplin was not happy with her performance at Woodstock. So, she didn't want her singing to be included in the 1970 documentary film or the soundtrack from that event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Information: - The Luna programme (from the Russian word \\"Luna\\" meaning \\"Moon\\"), occasionally called \\"Lunik\\" or \\"Lunnik\\" by western media, was a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. Fifteen were successful, each designed as either an orbiter or lander, and accomplished many firsts in space exploration. They also performed many experiments, studying the Moon's chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation. - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - Luna 3, or E-2A No.1 was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1959 as part of the Luna programme. It was the first-ever mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. It was also the third space probe to be sent to the neighborhood of the Moon. Though it returned rather poor pictures by later standards, the historic, never-before-seen views of the far side of the Moon caused excitement and interest when they were published around the world, and a tentative \\"Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon\\" was created after image processing improved the pictures. - A circumlunar trajectory, trans-lunar trajectory or lunar free return is a type of free return trajectory which takes a spacecraft from Earth, around the far side of the Moon, and back to Earth using only gravity once the initial trajectory is set. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. - Luna E- 3 No.1 , sometimes identified by NASA as Luna 1960A , was a Soviet spacecraft which was lost in a launch failure in 1960 . It was a 279 - kilogram ( 615 lb ) Luna E- 3 spacecraft , the first of two to be launched , both of which were lost in launch failures . It was intended to fly around the Moon on a circumlunar trajectory in order to image the surface of the Moon , including the far side . The E- 3 spacecraft were similar in design to the E- 2A which had been used for the earlier Luna 3 mission . However , they carried higher resolution cameras , and were intended to make closer flybys . - The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth. The far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South PoleAitken basin. Although both sides of the moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night, the far side is also referred to as the dark side of the Moon, originally in the sense of \\"unknown\\" rather than lack of light. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - A free-return trajectory is a trajectory of a spacecraft traveling away from a primary body (for example, the Earth) where gravity due to a secondary body (for example, the Moon) causes the spacecraft to return to the primary body without propulsion (hence the term \\"free\\"). - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

Article:","completion":"Title: Connie Nielsen's Love Affair with Copenhagen: A Deeper Look into the Actress's Passion for Denmark's Capital Introduction Connie Nielsen, the renowned Danish actress, is no stranger to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. However, despite her international fame and fortune, Nielsen has always remained true to her roots and expresses immense love and admiration for her hometown, Copenhagen. In a recent interview, Nielsen opened up about her love for Denmark's capital, saying that she refuses to embrace the fame and money side of acting and instead finds inspiration in the city's rich history and artistic atmosphere. Copenhagen's Inspiring Winters For many, the thought of long, dark, cold winters might seem daunting, but for Connie Nielsen, the winter months in Copenhagen present a unique opportunity for residents to explore their creative side. She explains that the long winters mean locals have to find ways to keep themselves entertained, stimulating the production of art, music, theater, and literature. As a result, Copenhagen is a melting pot of creativity that has inspired not only Nielsen herself, but countless Danish artists, writers, and musicians over the centuries. A City Rich in History and Culture Copenhagen's history dates back to the 10th century, and its colorful past is evident in the stunning architecture, cobblestone streets, and impressive monuments scattered throughout the city. Nielsen's love for the city's rich history is evident through her appreciation of its numerous museums, which house centuries' worth of Danish artwork, historical artifacts, and rare treasures. From the National Museum of Denmark to the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, visitors can immerse themselves in the captivating tales of Vikings, kings, and everyday city-dwellers that shaped the history of Copenhagen. The Unmatched Beauty of Copenhagen When it comes to the striking beauty of Copenhagen, Connie Nielsen's eyes light up as she describes the \\"very special quality\\" of the city's natural light — a feature that has been praised by many, including renowned artists.

Jesus Christ, one of the most prominent figures in history, has become the epicenter of debates among these groups. With the rise of the Occupy movement and the promotion of socialism in recent years, some argue that Jesus was the first socialist. However, others claim that Jesus was a free marketer. This article will explore Jesus as a free marketer rather than an Occupier, examining his teachings and actions. Step 1: Understanding Jesus' teachings on personal responsibility One fundamental principle of free-market capitalism is personal responsibility. This idea is rooted in the belief that individuals are responsible for their success and failure, a concept that Jesus promoted throughout his teachings. In the Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30), Jesus taught that individuals who are industrious and make the most of their skills and resources will be rewarded, whereas those who do not will face penalties. This parable emphasizes individual responsibility and showcases the importance of using one's resources effectively – a core principle in free-market capitalism. Step 2: Analyzing Jesus' stance on voluntary charity Free-market systems support voluntary charity and private property, which ensures that individuals can freely help others at their discretion without government interference. Jesus encouraged charitable giving and helping the needy without advocating forcible redistribution of wealth by authorities. In Mark 10:21, Jesus instructed the rich man to sell his possessions and give to the poor, stressing the importance of voluntary charity. He did not call for government-mandated redistribution of wealth, relying instead on personal choice and compassion. Step 3: Examining Jesus' support for wealth creation Free-market capitalism emphasizes wealth creation through entrepreneurship and innovation, which can ultimately benefit society as a whole. Jesus, too, acknowledged a person's right to create wealth ethically. In the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16), Jesus taught that entrepreneurs have the right to determine wages and negotiate with workers, illustrating his belief in private property and self-determination. Step 4: Assessing Jesus' perspective on limited government intervention Jesus' teachings on individual responsibility, private property, and voluntary charity demonstrate his support for limited government intervention in economic affairs. Although he espoused spiritual values and helping others, he maintained the importance of individualism and personal freedom. In Matthew 22:21, Jesus said, \\"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\\" This passage underlines his commitment to the separation of spiritual and earthly matters and suggests Jesus did not promote heavy government interference in individuals' lives, in line with free-market principles. Conclusion: While it is critical to remember that Jesus' primary mission was to bring salvation to humanity, his teachings can still provide insight into his economic beliefs. By examining Jesus' teachings on personal responsibility, voluntary charity, wealth creation, and limited government intervention, we can see that he was more closely aligned with free-market principles than socialist ones. Although modern political ideologies cannot fully encompass Jesus' teachings, analyzing his perspective can help inform contemporary discussions and understanding."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In the Sonoran Desert, French scientist, speaker at the Montsoreau conference, Claude Lacombe and his American interpreter, cartographer David Laughlin, along with other government scientific researchers, discover Flight 19, a squadron of Grumman TBM Avengers that disappeared more than 30 years earlier in the Bermuda Triangle. The planes are intact and operational, but there is no sign of the pilots. An old man who witnessed the event claimed that \\"the sun came out at night, and sang to him\\". At an air traffic control center in Indianapolis, controllers listen as two airline flights narrowly avoid a mid-air collision with an unidentified flying object, which neither pilot chooses to report, even when invited to do so. In Muncie, Indiana, 3-year-old Barry Guiler is awakened in the night when his toys start operating on their own. Fascinated, he gets out of bed and discovers something or someone (off-screen) in the kitchen. He runs outside, forcing his mother, Jillian, to chase after him. Investigating one of a series of large-scale power outages, Indiana electrical lineman Roy Neary experiences a close encounter with a UFO, when it flies over his truck and lightly burns the side of his face with its bright lights. Chasing it, he almost hits Barry and Jillian, and they encounter the UFO with three other UFOs. Neary joins three police cars pursuing them, but the spacecraft fly off into the night sky. Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with subliminal, mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. The presence of the UFO energy field makes every appliance in Jillian's house malfunction and Barry is abducted by unseen beings.","completion":"The UFOs have been spotted in the Sonoran Desert, over an air traffic control center in Indianapolis, near Muncie, Indiana where Barry Guiler encounters them, and at Jillian's house, where a UFO descends from the clouds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gary Lineker, Bob Geldof, Anne Robinson and Victoria Beckham are also among the 1,000 household names affected. A string of celebrities from David and Victoria Beckham to Andrew Lloyd Webber face having to pay the taxman a total of £1 billion in a dispute over a suspected tax avoidance scheme. The Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP scheme qualified for tax breaks under rules designed to stimulate the British film industry. Hit movies such as Life of Pi, Avatar and Girl With a Pearl Earring all benefited from tax relief. But HMRC now argues such schemes were not legitimate investment opportunities but a means of avoiding tax. Now a confidential letter, seen by the Sunday Times, has been sent by Ingenious Media Investments to its celebrity investors warning them of ‘draconian’ plans by HM Revenue and Customs to make them pay up to £1billion they had received in tax relief. The newspaper claimed the tough new approach reflected HMRC’s frustration at dealing with a backlog of some 65,000 individuals and businesses it suspects of using tax avoidance schemes. The Ingenious film scheme is soon to be tested at a tax tribunal, but HMRC is asking investors to repay money even before their case comes to court. Gary Lineker, Bob Geldof, Anne Robinson and Victoria Beckham are also among the 1,000 household names affected. The letter from John Boyton at Ingenious Media Investments tells clients: ‘This proposal would accelerate the payment of the tax repaid to you by HMRC, in advance of the outcome of the current legislation.’ Other household names who invested in the firm’s ventures include the singers Geri Halliwell and Annie Lennox, television presenters Ant and Dec and Davina McCall, and England football manager Roy Hodgson, along with football stars Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. Ingenious denies HMRC’s claims and intends to fight for its scheme in the tax tribunal scheduled for November. Lord Lloyd-Webber told the Sunday Times he was advised that he was being ‘almost philanthropic by investing in the British film industry, and that this was a scheme to promote British films’, adding: ‘At no time did I consider it solely a tax scheme.’ A spokesman for the Beckhams said: ‘They have always paid the taxes they have owed in full.’ Last night Ingenious said the HMRC’s demands were ‘indiscriminate and unfair’. A company spokesman said: ‘Ingenious has been trying to obtain a definitive ruling on the tax status of its film and games partnerships for many years. The company requested a hearing before the tax tribunal in 2011 to resolve this matter as expeditiously as possible, but HMRC has repeatedly used stalling tactics to delay a hearing. ‘Ingenious is proud of its record in financing hit films, including Avatar, Life of Pi and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which have generated more than £1 billion of taxable revenue for the UK Treasury, with a further £1 billion of taxable revenue expected over the life of the films.’ What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move faster? Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Group Jones' cans had the air molecules inside move faster. Since they didn't make holes in the cans before heating them, the air inside the cans was trapped and gained more kinetic energy from the heat. This caused the air molecules to move faster, increasing the pressure inside the cans until they exploded. In contrast, Group George vented their cans first, allowing the air molecules to escape and preventing a build-up of pressure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: The allele frequency (or gene frequency) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population. Until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms, but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change. In population genetics, the term evolution is defined as a change in the frequency of an allele in a population. Using the ABO blood type system as an example, the frequency of one of the alleles, IA, is the number of [1] copies of that allele divided by all the copies of the ABO gene in the population. For example, a study in Jordan found a frequency of IA to be 26.1 percent. The IB and I0 alleles made up 13.4 percent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively, and all of the frequencies added up to 100 percent. A change in this frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population. The allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles become more widespread than others during the process of natural selection. Natural selection can alter the population’s genetic makeup; for example, if a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more offspring. Because many of those offspring will also carry the beneficial allele, and often the corresponding phenotype, they will have more offspring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle. Over time, the allele will spread throughout the population. Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way, meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool. The gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population. Sometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele frequencies. This phenomenon is called genetic drift. Natural selection and genetic drift usually occur... Q: What is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population called?

To Philip it was an exceedingly pleasant one. Everything was new to him; the architecture of the churches and villages, the dress of the people, their modes of agriculture, all differing widely from those to which he was accustomed. In some villages the Catholics predominated, and here the passage of the little party was regarded with frowning brows and muttered threats; by the Huguenots they were saluted respectfully, and if they halted, many questions were asked their followers as to news about the intentions of the court, the last rumours as to the attitude of Conde, and the prospects of a continuance of peace. Here, too, great respect was paid to Marie and Philip when it was known they were relatives of the Countess de Laville, and belonged to the family of the De Moulins. Emilie had for some time been a widow--the count, her husband, having fallen at the battle of Dreux, at the end of the year 1562--but being an active and capable woman, she had taken into her hands the entire management of the estates, and was one of the most influential among the Huguenot nobles of that part of the country. From their last halting place, Marie Vaillant sent on a letter by one of the men to her sister, announcing their coming. She had written on her landing at La Rochelle, and they had been met on their way by a messenger from the countess, expressing her delight that her sister had at last carried out her promise to visit her, and saying that Francois was looking eagerly for the coming of his cousin. 1.

Based on the given paragraph, when considering life in the ocean, plankton are the most common life forms. While the other choices provided—algae, kelp, and coral—are also important components of the marine ecosystem, the paragraph explicitly states that plankton are the most common among the three major groups of marine life. These groups are plankton, nekton, and benthos. Plankton are tiny organisms that float or drift in the ocean currents. They are primarily composed of microscopic algae (called phytoplankton) and small animals (called zooplankton). Phytoplankton, which are photosynthetic microorganisms, play an essential role in the marine food chain, as they convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into food for themselves and other organisms. Zooplankton, on the other hand, mainly feed on phytoplankton and are, in turn, a food source for larger marine creatures like fish and whales. Therefore, the prevalence and importance of plankton in the ocean make them the most common life form in the marine ecosystem.

Article: When people reunite with their loved ones, it's usually a wildly happy moment. But what is their most common response to seeing them again? It may seem strange, but most of the time they break down in tears. Now a group of psychologists from Yale University in the US say they have found the reason why, and that crying tears of joy may well be the body's way of restoring emotional balance. \\" _ seem to take place when people are unable to tolerate strong positive emotions, and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions,\\" Oriana Aragon, the lead researcher, told The Telegraph. Aragon and her fellow psychologists looked at hundreds of participants' emotional responses to different things, including happy reunions and cute babies. Many participants said they would react in a negative or aggressive way to the positive things -- to cry at happy moments and want to pinch a cute baby's face or even tell them \\"I want to eat you up!\\" But then researchers found that these people were able to calm down from strong emotions more quickly. \\"We want a happy, middle spot. Extreme is not good. It's hard on our bodies,\\" Aragon told The Washington Post. There are many other examples of times when people respond to a positive experience with a negative emotional reaction. At an exciting concert, fans scream in horror at their idols. People who have just had a big lottery win are often in floods of tears. \\"These findings advance our understanding of how people express and control their emotions, which is importantly related to mental and physical health, the quality of relationship with others, and even how well people work together,\\" said Aragon. The psychologists then went further and claimed that the reverse was also true. Strong negative feelings may also bring out positive expressions.

What is the answer for the question: Who told the mobsters that Trevor was a junkie? from the following article ? Andy, Trevor, and Billy are childhood friends. As young adults, Billy sells drugs and Andy does deliveries for him. One night, Trevor delivers instead and gets busted by narcs. 5 years later, Trevor is released from jail and learns his girlfriend Laura is now with Billy. Trevor gets back with her and decides to rob a local mobster. Trevor wants some cash to buy Laura some gifts and Andy was told by some local mobsters that they are investing money with huge profits and he wants some cash to buy in. However, their robbery is very sloppy and the head mobster quickly figures out what happened. However, he and Andy's grandfather were good friends, so he tells Andy and Trevor that they can work off what they owe by smuggling stolen diamonds. Billy finds out what is going on and is mildly amused by it until he realizes that Trevor has gotten back together with Laura behind his back. He retaliates by convincing the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie and is stealing the diamonds that he is supposed to be delivering to supply his habit. He also convinces the diamond dealer that Trevor cannot be trusted with real diamonds and he gives him fake diamonds instead. When he delivers them to the mob, they quickly spot them as fakes and assume Trevor switched them. Billy figured by doing this, the mobsters would send a goon to kill Trevor and with him out of the picture, he could have Laura back with no blood on his hands. However, since he was the one to notify the mobsters, they tell him if he wants Trevor dead he has to do the killing himself. He finds Trevor at Laura's house having just made love and kidnaps him at gunpoint. He takes Trevor to a field to kill him. Even though Trevor begs for his life and Billy struggles with his conscience for the briefest of moments, he pulls the trigger anyway, killing Trevor in cold blood.","completion":"In the article provided, it is revealed that Billy is the one who told the mobsters that Trevor was a junkie. This information plays a crucial role in a series of events that ultimately lead to Trevor's death. As detailed in the story, Billy sells drugs, and he and Trevor have a tense relationship due to their shared romantic interest in Laura, who is now with Billy after Trevor's release from jail. Tensions escalate when Trevor and Andy decide to rob a local mobster. Their plan backfires, but they manage to avoid severe consequences by agreeing to work off their debt, smuggling stolen diamonds. Upon finding out about their plan and learning about Trevor's romantic reunion with Laura, Billy feels betrayed and aims to retaliate. Billy's revenge plan involves convincing the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie who is stealing diamonds meant for delivery to fund his drug habit. He manipulates the situation further by persuading the diamond dealer to provide Trevor with fake diamonds. Eventually, the mobsters discover the fake diamonds and assume Trevor switched them, implicating him as the culprit. Since Billy was the one who informed the mobsters of Trevor's alleged drug problem, they instruct him to carry out the hit on Trevor. The story reaches its tragic climax when Billy, grappling with his conflicting emotions, ultimately pulls the trigger and kills Trevor in cold blood. In summary, it is Billy who informs the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie, as part of his vengeful scheme to eliminate Trevor and regain sole control over his relationship with Laura. This accusation creates a domino effect of events that result in the tragic ending of Trevor's life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Plot title: Omen III: The Final Conflict Movie plot: Damien Thorn (Sam Neill), now 32 years old and head of his late uncle's international conglomerate, is appointed Ambassador to Great Britain, the same position his adoptive father held in the first film. Unlike the previous Omen films, the adult Damien is now entirely aware of his unholy lineage, and his destiny.An alignment of the stars in the Cassiopeia region of the night sky causes the generation of a 'superstar', described in the film as a second Star of Bethlehem. Thorn realizes it is a sign of the Second Coming of Christ and he orders all boys in England born on the morning of March 24, 1982 (the morning when, in the story, the Cassiopeia alignment occurred) to be killed in order to prevent the Christ-child's return to power.A subplot deals with one of Thorn's disciples, Harvey Dean, attempting to hide the fact that his own son was born at the appointed time; Dean not only fails at hiding that fact about his child from Damien, but is killed by his own hypnotized wife - likely in retaliation for refusing to go through with Damien's command to murder his son as a test of loyalty (the last child whom Damien suspects).Thorn has also become romantically involved with journalist Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow), a complex relationship which undermines his plans for political dominion for the time being. But Damien is not deterred from his plans and even focuses his attention on her preadolescent son Peter (Barnaby Holm), whom he takes as a disciple, partly by manipulating and exploiting the boy's internal desire to have a father-figure.Meanwhile, Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi) and six other priests armed with the seven daggers of Megiddo - ancient holy weapons which are the only Earthly weapons which can harm the Antichrist - hunt Thorn in the hope of killing him before he can destroy the Christ-child. However, one by one, Damien kills off all the priests (some in horrific circumstances) until only DeCarlo survives.Finally, in spite of Thorn's efforts, DeCarlo informs Reynolds that the Christ-child is out of his...

I can use this background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. Now, I have a new situation: The country of Hinland reduced taxation hoping it would mean more money for government spending. On the other hand, Silvania, a southern country increased taxation hoping they would increase collection amounts. The problem was that Silvanian people increased taxation above the critical rate. Answer this question please: Which country experienced an increase in government revenue?","completion":"Based on the information and background provided, the country that experienced an increase in government revenue is Hinland. As per the Laffer curve concept, there is an optimal tax rate that maximizes government revenue. When the tax rate is higher than this critical point, an increase in the tax rate will lead to a decrease in government revenue, and vice versa. This is due to the fact that high tax rates discourage people from working and investing, leading to a drop in economic activity and, consequently, a decrease in the tax base. In this particular scenario, Hinland reduced taxation with the expectation that this decision would result in more money for government spending. By doing so, Hinland likely stimulated economic activity, which increased the incentive for individuals and businesses to work and invest. This, in turn, led to a broader tax base and ultimately an increase in government revenue. On the other hand, Silvania decided to increase taxation in the hopes of enhancing government revenues. However, as mentioned, the government in Silvania set the tax rate above the critical point, as described by the Laffer curve. As a consequence, the rise in the tax rate reduced labor supply, discouraged investment, and decreased overall economic activity. This shrinkage in the tax base resulted in a decline in government revenue instead of the anticipated increase. In conclusion, Hinland, which reduced its taxation rate below the critical point on the Laffer curve, experienced an increase in government revenue by encouraging economic activity and incentivizing labor supply. Conversely, Silvania, by increasing its tax rate above the critical point, discouraged economic activity and labor supply and thereby experienced a decrease in government revenue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Journey is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1973, composed of former members of Santana and Frumious Bandersnatch. The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". Context: Journey's album sales did not improve and Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman, with whom keyboardist Gregg Rolie could share lead vocal duties. The band hired Robert Fleischman and transitioned to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977 and together the new incarnation of the band wrote the hit \\"Wheel in the Sky\\"; however, management differences resulted in Fleischman leaving within the year. In late 1977, Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer. Herbie Herbert, the band's manager, also hired Roy Thomas Baker as a producer to add a layered sound approach as Baker had done with his previous band, Queen. With their new lead singer and talented new producer, Journey released their fourth album, Infinity (1978). This album set Journey on their road to stardom with their first RIAA-certified platinum album. This album, with their hit song \\"Wheel in the Sky\\" (#57 U.S.), set Journey on a new path with a more mainstream sound to make their highest chart success to date. In late 1978, manager Herbie Herbert fired drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who joined Bay Area rivals Jefferson Starship shortly thereafter. He was replaced by Berklee-trained jazz drummer Steve Smith. Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith and Valory recorded Evolution (1979), which gave the band their first Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single, \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\" (#16); and Departure (1980), which reached No. 8 on the album charts. Journey's newfound success brought the band an almost entirely new fan base. During the 1980 Departure world tour, the band recorded a live album, Captured. Keyboardist Gregg Rolie then left the band, the second time in his career he left a successful act. Keyboardist Stevie \\"Keys\\" Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track for Captured, \\"The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love),\\" but Rolie recommended pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as the permanent replacement. With Cain's replacement of Rolie's Hammond B-3 organ with his own synthesizers, the band was poised for a new decade in which they would achieve their greatest musical success. Question: what other music did they write? Answer:","completion":"Following the lineup changes and the shift to a more mainstream sound, Journey continued to craft hit songs, cementing their status as a titan in the world of rock. Their evolving style, marked by expansive arrangements, memorable hooks, and powerful ballads, struck a chord with audiences and garnered the band numerous chart successes. After the 1978 release of Infinity, which featured \\"Wheel in the Sky\\", Journey went on to release several more successful albums, each yielding a number of beloved tracks: Evolution (1979): This album provided the band its first Top 20 single \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\" (#16). Other notable tracks on this album include \\"Just the Same Way,\\" \\"Do You Recall,\\" and \\"Majestic.\\" Departure (1980): Reaching No. 8 on the album charts, Departure featured popular songs such as \\"Any Way You Want It,\\" \\"Walks Like a Lady,\\" and \\"Where Were You.\\" Captured (1981): A live album recorded during the 1980 Departure world tour, Captured's sole studio track was \\"The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love).\\" Escape (1981): As Journey's most successful album to date, this record hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and included multiple hit singles, such as \\"Don't Stop Believin',\\" \\"Stone in Love,\\" \\"Who's Crying Now,\\" and \\"Open Arms.\\" Frontiers (1983): This album further solidified Journey's commercial success, featuring tracks like \\"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart),\\" \\"Faithfully,\\" \\"Send Her My Love,\\" and \\"After the Fall.\\" Raised on Radio (1986): Although the mid-80s saw some lineup changes, Raised on Radio generated popular songs such as \\"Be Good to Yourself,\\" \\"I'll Be Alright Without You,\\" and \\"Girl Can't Help It.\\" Trial by Fire (1996): Journey reunited with Steve Perry for this late-'90s album, which produced the hit single \\"When You Love a Woman\\" (#12 on Billboard Hot 100). Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Journey continued to release new music, including albums like Arrival (2001), Generations (2005), Revelation (2008), and Eclipse (2011), featuring songs such as \\"Never Too Late,\\" \\"After All These Years,\\" and \\"Anything Is Possible.\\" In their long and storied career, Journey has written and recorded a diverse and extensive body of music.

Ned is then arrested on a charge of selling drugs. Ned has three sisters: Miranda the middle sister, is a journalist for Vanity Fair trying to get her first major article published. Though she has trouble finding a man to keep her interest, she and a neighbor, Jeremy have hidden feelings for each other. Natalie, the youngest, is an independent, bisexual hipster living with her girlfriend, Cindy, and five other roommates. Liz, the oldest, is married to Dylan, a documentary filmmaker. Their marriage is failing as Dylan shows no sexual or emotional interest in Liz. They also have strict control over their son River, which leaves him unhappy and unable to express himself. When Ned is released from prison, he returns home to his girl and his dog. He finds that she is living with Billy, and no longer wishes to continue their relationship or allow him to work at the farm. Billy gives Ned a ride into town and tells him that if he can scrape together 500 for the first 2 months rent, Janet might let him stay in the goat barn behind the farm. Ned initially stays at his mother's house but a few days later shows up at Liz's place, asking if he can stay with her. He is put in River's room and told that he must help around the house and work with Dylan on his newest documentary about a Russian ballerina named Tatiana.

(AP Photo/Michael... (Associated Press) CARMEL, Ind. (AP) — Two employees laid off by the parent company of for-profit college chain ITT Technical Institute have filed a lawsuit claiming the company violated federal law by not providing 60 days' notice. Allen Federman, a business analyst at ITT Educational Services Inc.'s Carmel, Indiana, headquarters, and Steve Ryan, an instructor at two ITT Technical Institute locations in California, filed the complaint Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Delaware. The lawsuit seeks class-action status on behalf of the 8,000 employees who are losing their jobs as a result of ITT's decision to shut down all 130 ITT Technical Institute campuses in 38 states, the Indianapolis Business Journal reported (http://bit.ly/2bTrBgt ). ITT announced Tuesday it was closing the campuses because it cannot survive recent sanctions by the U.S. Department of Education. The lawsuit claims ITT violated the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act, which requires 60 days' advance written notice in the case of mass layoffs or plant closings. The law affects employers with more than 100 employees and business sites with more than 50 workers. ITT Tech campuses with fewer than 50 employees might not be responsible for following the law. The suit also claims the layoff violates California labor laws, which also require 60 days' notice during mass layoffs. ITT Educational operated 15 ITT Tech campuses in California. The lawsuit asks for each affected employee to receive \\"unpaid wages, salary, commissions, bonuses\\" and other benefits that would have been paid over a 60-day period. ITT spokeswoman Nicole Elam called the campus closures \\"a complicated process.\\" In an email to the newspaper, Elam said \\"all matters involving students and personnel are priorities.\\" The chain was banned Aug. 25 from enrolling new students who used federal financial aid because, Education Department officials said, the company had become a risk to students and taxpayers. The department also ordered ITT to pay 152 million within 30 days to help cover student refunds and other liabilities if the chain closed. ITT Educational Services CEO Kevin Modany told reporters on a conference call Tuesday that ITT was the victim of a \\"regulatory assault\\" and never had the chance to defend itself. One of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs is Jack A. Raisner of Outten & Golden LLP of New York, who represented employees of Corinthian College, another for-profit education chain that closed in April 2015 after the government withdrew aid. ___ Information from: Indianapolis Business Journal, http://www.ibj.com ||||| Summary:","completion":"A for-profit school operator called ITT Educational Services closed recently and now a teacher and an office staffer who lost their jobs have started a lawsuit.

They want the company to pay the workers the money they would have earned in those 60 days.

How can I let the family know that I'm thankful for their kindness? Wang Lin Letter B Dear Wang Lin, It's a good idea to bring a small present when you go to a dinner party. Flowers are always nice, or you may bring a bottle of wine if you know that your friends drink it. You should arrive on time or five to ten minutes late. Don't get there early. If you're going to be more than fifteen minutes late, you should call and tell them. Try to be free at the dinner table.

For a number of reasons, friendly service, excellent ambience with a trendy, comfortable feel, good food and a great bar to sit and just be friendly. We ordered the Greek appetizer, which is very common in many places, but the presentation of this one, made it quite different from the rest. On the bottom was hummus, topped with traditional Greek style cucumber, tomato with light olive oil dressing, and a side of Tzazitki and pita. Unique and quite good. More pita would have been nice. For lunch we ordered the Porkwich, recommended by the waitress and a side of the Mac and Cheese. The sandwich was delcious, but the Mac and cheese lacked \\"punch\\" and I was not wowed by it. I'll save that for the Tuck Shop next time. We also ordered the ribs and they were tender, tasty and really had a nice unique flavor. We had a side of the potatoes and OMG, they were delicious.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

They are asking about the same general idea - where to find part-time jobs - but the specifications of who is asking and where they are asking for differ. The first question is a general query about where to find part-time jobs. It doesn't specify a target audience or a location. The answers to this could be broad and applicable for a wide range of people and locations. Here are a few general routes to find part-time jobs: 1. Online Job Portals: Websites such as Indeed, Naukri, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Monster host a massive array of job listings from companies around the world. You can filter these listings based on factors like job type, location, industry, and more. 2. Direct Applications: If you have specific companies in mind, you can go directly to their websites and check out their 'Careers' or 'Jobs' sections. Most companies post their available positions there, and allow you to apply directly through their site. 3. Staffing Agencies: These agencies specialize in connecting companies with job seekers. Some specialise in part-time or temp work. 4. Local Classifieds: Local newspapers and classified websites may list part-time job opportunities in your area. 5. Networking: Depending on your industry, many job opportunities aren't posted publicly. Instead, these jobs are filled through internal promotions or referrals from current employees. Networking through professional industry events or platforms like LinkedIn can be a great way to find these \\"hidden\\" job opportunities. On the other hand, the second question is specifically asking for locations where students can find part-time jobs in Bangalore. This question assumes a narrower scope, i.e., the answer should be more specific and targeted to the interests and qualifications of students and focus on job opportunities available in Bangalore. To find part-time jobs for students in Bangalore, you might consider: 1. Online Job Portals: Websites like Internshala, Let's Intern and Freshersworld are famous among students for finding part-time jobs and internships. 2. University Career Centers: They often have relationships with local businesses and can alert students to available part-time jobs. 3. Tutors / Teaching Jobs: With numerous schools and colleges, there's always a demand for tutors in Bangalore. This could be a good part-time job for students proficient in certain subjects. 4. Part-time jobs in Retail, Food Service, Call Centers: Many of these do not require very specific skills and have flexible hours. 5. Startup internships: Bangalore is a major start-up hub, and many of these companies offer part-time positions and internships.

The bicycles will have smart phones attached to the handlebars measuring how much power is being generated for the hotel. The plan, a world-first, will start on 19 April and run for a year. Only guests staying at the hotel will be able to take part. Frederikke Toemmergaard, hotel spokeswoman, said, \\"Many of our visitors are business people who enjoy going to the gym. There might be people who will cycle just to get a free meal, but generally I don't think people will take advantage of our programme,\\" Copenhagen has a long-standing cycling tradition and 36% of locals cycle to work each day, one of the highest percentages in the world, according to the website visitcopenhagen.dk.

The spider caught more flies if it built its web on the ceiling instead of the floor since the","completion":"flies tended to gather closer to the light sources overhead. However, constructing a web on the ceiling had its own challenges. The spider, known to its fellow creatures as Cecil, was not just a typical house spider. Cecil was a highly intelligent and creative spider, who had learned through numerous trial and error that catching flies on the ceiling was much more effective than the traditional method of web-building on the floor. Cecil's hard work and experimentation had also provided a way to overcome the technical challenges associated with constructing a web on the ceiling. One day, as Cecil was beginning another ceiling-web project, Flora, the resident firefly, passed by, curious about what the spider was up to. She had observed Cecil's web designs before and was quite intrigued by the deviations from the ordinary webs of other spiders. Noticing the attention from the firefly, Cecil, who understood the curiosity to learn, decided to share the secret of its successful upside-down hunting technique. \\"All the other spiders build their webs in the corners of walls or on the ground. But, after seeing that most flies usually hover near the light, I found out that the ceiling was the prime location,\\" explained Cecil. \\"I must ensure that the web remains secure and in place, defying gravity. To do that, I use numerous anchors, and I also produce a stronger, viscous silk for constructing the web.\\" Flora was impressed and decided to help Cecil complete the web by using her natural light to guide and attract more insects towards the web. As time went by, the two creatures worked in perfect harmony, each of their roles in sync as the bait-and-capture strategy continued to flourish. Cecil was more than grateful to Flora, as the web on the ceiling had become a veritable smorgasbord of tasty treats for the astute spider. Word of their unusual collaboration spread throughout the insect world, and soon, more creatures started to come to them for seasoned advice. From innovative ways of resource gathering to survival techniques, Cecil and Flora became known as the ultimate problem-solving duo in their community. With each passing day, Cecil's web designs continued to become more intricate and impressive. Not only did they serve as fantastic traps for prey, but they also became a work of art admired by all. Flora's light created beautiful reflections on Cecil's webs, transforming every room in the house into a montage of captivating colors. Unbeknownst to the duo, the human residents of the house also began to appreciate the exceptional showcase. Over time, the family became more accommodating to the presence of the spider and its firefly friend, providing them with a safer and more welcoming environment. Together, Cecil and Flora thrived, dazzling the world around them with their practical brilliance and boundless resourcefulness. Their courage and collaboration taught everyone that breaking free of traditional boundaries and working together could lead to unimaginable outcomes. In the end, what started as a quest for survival had transformed into a lasting partnership between two seemingly unconnected creatures, defying the constraints of their nature. Through determination, adaptability, and the support of a valuable friend, Cecil the spider turned an upside-down web into a life full of meaning and purpose, proving that even the tiniest members of the animal kingdom could make a lasting impact in their world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: What happens when you eat too many apples? Question 2: Am I eating too much fruit? I eat 2 bananas, an orange, and an apple a day. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer to Question 1: What happens when you eat too many apples? Eating too many apples can have several effects on your body, both short-term and long-term. While apples are generally healthy, consuming an excessive amount may lead to the following outcomes: 1. Digestive problems: Apples are a good source of dietary fiber, specifically soluble fiber, which helps maintain a healthy gut. However, consuming too much fiber can cause a range of gastrointestinal issues, such as bloating, gas, cramping, and diarrhea. This discomfort is usually short-lived but may persist if you continue to eat excessive amounts of apples. 2. Tooth decay: Apples are acidic, and frequent consumption of acidic fruits can erode tooth enamel and increase the risk of tooth decay. Chewing on apples stimulates saliva production, which helps neutralize some acids, but the potential for harm remains if you consume too many apples. 3. Imbalanced diet: Eating an excessive number of apples as part of your daily diet may lead to an imbalance in your overall nutrition. You could be neglecting other essential nutrients found in a variety of different foods by focusing too much on apples. 4. Pesticide exposure: Conventionally grown apples often have pesticide residues on their skins. Although the levels are generally considered safe, consuming a very high number of apples could potentially increase your exposure to these chemicals and the associated risks. 5. Fructose intolerance: Some people may be intolerant or sensitive to fructose, a natural sugar found in fruits like apples. Ingesting too many apples may exacerbate symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea, for those individuals. Answer to Question 2: Am I eating too much fruit? I eat 2 bananas, an orange, and an apple a day. Eating two bananas, an orange, and an apple a day is generally not considered excessive fruit consumption for most people. This amount of fruit contributes to the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables, and it is beneficial for maintaining a balanced diet. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), adults should consume around 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit per day, depending on age, sex, and physical activity level. The fruit intake you described, which consists of three different fruits including apples, falls within the recommended range. However, the answer may vary depending on individual factors, such as age, weight, activity level, nutritional requirements, or health conditions. For example, if you have a medical condition that requires you to limit your fruit intake due to the sugar content, like diabetes, you may need to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. In conclusion, the answer to these two questions is not the same. Eating too many apples can lead to several health issues, while consuming a moderate amount of different fruits (like two bananas, an orange, and an apple a day) generally falls within the recommended daily intake and is considered part of a balanced diet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This skin-care shift draws attention to peel-off masks as a more appealing option, especially for those who enjoy the satisfying reveal of glowing, revitalized skin once the mask is removed. Taking the place of sheet masks, peel-off masks have experienced a surge in popularity and can be found in various forms, catering to distinct skin types and catering to different skin needs. This includes anything from pore-cleansing and oil-absorbing masks to those designed for hydration and nourishment. These masks create a film over the skin that, once firmly set and dried, can be peeled off in a single motion. The process can often feel luxurious and satisfying from start to finish - beginning with the application of the mask to the final reveal of a radiant complexion. In addition to their efficacy, peel-off masks are also becoming popular due to their \\"selfie-worthy\\" nature. The act of peeling off the mask not only results in refreshed skin but also provides a visually appealing moment that many users enjoy capturing on camera and sharing on social media. Given the current enthusiasm for peel-off masks, it is fitting to state that sheet masks are no longer considered the go-to superstar skin-care treatment.

Scarpia's apartment in the Palazzo Farnese, that evening Scarpia, at supper, sends a note to Tosca asking her to come to his apartment, anticipating that two of his goals will soon be fulfilled at once. His agent, Spoletta, arrives to report that Angelotti remains at large, but Cavaradossi has been arrested for questioning. He is brought in, and an interrogation ensues. As the painter steadfastly denies knowing anything about Angelotti's escape, Tosca's voice is heard singing a celebratory cantata elsewhere in the Palace. She enters the apartment in time to see Cavaradossi being escorted to an antechamber. All he has time to say is that she mustn't tell them anything. Scarpia then claims she can save her lover from indescribable pain if she reveals Angelotti's hiding place. She resists, but the sound of screams coming through the door eventually breaks her down, and she tells Scarpia to search the well in the garden of Cavaradossi's villa. Scarpia orders his torturers to cease, and the bloodied painter is dragged back in. He's devastated to discover that Tosca has betrayed his friend. Sciarrone, another agent, then enters with news: there was an upset on the battlefield at Marengo, and the French are marching on Rome. Cavaradossi, unable to contain himself, gloats to Scarpia that his rule of terror will soon be at an end. This is enough for the police to consider him guilty, and they haul him away to be shot.

The SNP has concerns that Fort George at Ardersier, near Inverness, is to stop functioning as a barracks as part of Ministry of Defence reforms. In a letter to SNP MP Drew Hendry, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said he could not confirm at this stage the military's future use of the barracks. SNP MSP Fergus Ewing said the letter added to the uncertainty over the fort. Soldiers of the Black Watch (3 SCOTS) are currently based at Fort George. Mr Mundell said in his letter that the future of the battalion was not under threat. On the fort itself, he wrote: \\"The Ministry of Defence's rationalisation strategy will examine the entire Defence Estate across the whole of the UK, with the aim of providing a smaller but more efficient and more sustainable estate. \\"Savings made in this way will be used to improve military capability. \\"To this end, a number of announcements of disposal have already been made. \\"It is likely that some sites in Scotland will be released for disposal as part of the wider plan which is due to report later this year, but I am unable to confirm whether Fort George will be included as part of this until the report is complete.\\" Mr Ewing said Fort George should remain as a working barracks. He told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \\"As constituency MSP for Fort George I believe it should continue as is and house the Black Watch. \\"The proposal from the UK government that there will be further reductions to conventional defence are, I think, quite shocking.

Translate this to English?","completion":"I believe that a continuation of the development of the maritime economy is essential. The maritime economy, also referred to as \\"blue economy,\\" is the sector comprising multiple industries and activities related to the sustainable use of marine resources for economic growth. It covers a wide array of activities, such as shipping, fishing, aquaculture, tourism, renewable energy, and development of new marine technologies, among others. The need for a continuation of the development of the maritime economy is crucial for several reasons. First, the global economy relies heavily on shipping for international trade. A robust maritime economy ensures smoother and more efficient trade by facilitating the transportation of goods across different markets. It is estimated that around 80% of world trade by volume and over 70% by value is carried by sea, according to the International Maritime Organization. Therefore, further development of this sector will continue to support global commerce and positively impact the overall economic growth. Second, sustainable fisheries and aquaculture are essential to ensure global food security. With a growing global population and the increasing demand for seafood, a well-developed and sustainable maritime economy is necessary to meet these demands and minimize the negative environmental impacts associated with overfishing and unsustainable practices. Third, the development of marine renewable energy, such as offshore wind and wave energy, offers vast potential for clean and sustainable electricity generation. Investing in the research and development of such technologies will not only help in meeting the increasing energy needs of the world but also contribute to combatting climate change by reducing the dependency on fossil fuels. Furthermore, the blue economy presents opportunities for creating new jobs and fostering innovation. As new industries, such as marine biotechnology and deep-sea mining, continue to emerge, they will require a skilled workforce and innovative solutions to ensure sustainable and responsible growth. This way, the development of the maritime economy can stimulate economic growth and provide new employment opportunities. Lastly, a thriving maritime economy can lead to the enhancement of the coastal and marine environment. Through proper management and conservation measures, the sustainable use of marine resources can protect marine ecosystems and biodiversity, thus preserving these valuable resources for future generations. In conclusion, the continuation of the development of the maritime economy is essential for maintaining global trade, ensuring food security, promoting renewable energy, creating new jobs, fostering innovation, and preserving our marine environments. To achieve this, governments, industry, and various stakeholders must collaborate and invest in innovative and sustainable solutions to address the challenges associated with the growth of the maritime economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This increases yields through reduced drying of the crop and/or by preventing the crop from toppling in strong wind gusts. and the situation: Two farms had winds destroying their crops. Hill farm started installing windbreaks, while Valley farm didn't have the funds to do that so they postponed the project. Answer the following question: Which farm reduced the wind velocity around crops? Answer:","completion":"Hill farm successfully reduced the wind velocity around their crops by installing windbreaks. As mentioned in the background information, windbreaks serve to lower wind velocity over and around crops, which leads to increased yields through reduced drying and prevention of crop toppling due to strong wind gusts. In the given situation, both Hill farm and Valley farm were experiencing winds that were causing damage to their crops. Hill farm took the initiative to install windbreaks to combat this issue, while Valley farm did not have the funds necessary to implement a similar solution and had to postpone their project. As a result, Hill farm was the one that effectively reduced the wind velocity around their crops by utilizing windbreaks, which will likely lead to better crop yields and less damage from strong winds. In contrast, Valley farm remains vulnerable to wind damage due to their inability to fund and install windbreaks currently. It is crucial for them to find ways to secure the necessary funding or explore alternative methods to protect their crops from destructive winds. This could include applying for grants or loans, seeking assistance from government programs that support agricultural activities, or even considering alternative windbreak options such as planting rows of trees or shrubs that can serve as a natural barrier against the wind. Overall, windbreaks play an essential role in protecting crops from damaging winds and ensuring higher yields, especially in situations where strong winds are a persistent problem. In this case, Hill farm has taken the right approach in installing windbreaks, which will provide them with practical benefits and a more robust agricultural system. On the other hand, Valley farm faces a challenging situation that calls for proactive measures to address their vulnerability to wind damage and find a suitable solution to secure their crops and livelihood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Primal Fear Movie plot: Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a Chicago defense attorney who loves the public spotlight and does everything he can to get his high-profile clients acquitted on legal technicalities. One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono. During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney). As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish. When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself \\"Roy\\" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop and throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell. When this incident is over, Aaron's personality re-emerges and appears to have no recollection of the personality switch.

When Scranton agreed to take on Steamtown, U.S.A., it was estimated that the museum and excursion business would attract 200,000 to 400,000 visitors to the city every year. In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent. Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study.

Translate to English English:","completion":"It is also important to promote market pricing mechanisms in third countries - for example, following state fuel subsidies. In today's globalized economy, promoting market pricing mechanisms in third countries has become an essential aspect to ensure fair competition and a healthy economic environment. Market pricing mechanisms refer to the way prices are determined by the interaction of supply and demand in a competitive market. These mechanisms play a critical role in market efficiency, resource allocation, and overall economic growth. State fuel subsidies, for instance, are a common practice in many countries to provide financial aid to their domestic industries and citizens. However, these subsidies can interfere with market pricing mechanisms and create discrepancies in the international markets. By offering artificially low prices, these subsidies encourage excessive consumption, put a strain on resources, and create negative environmental impacts. Therefore, it is crucial to encourage the adoption of market pricing mechanisms in third countries, particularly following state fuel subsidies. To achieve this, the following measures can be implemented: 1. International collaboration: Encourage communication and collaboration among countries, regional trade organizations, and international financial institutions to promote market pricing mechanisms and eliminate practices that distort the market. 2. Technical assistance: Provide technical aid to third countries in developing robust and transparent systems for market pricing. This can include exchanging best practices, providing training, and offering support in designing and implementing effective policies. 3. Capacity building: Support programs aimed at strengthening the capacity of third countries to implement market pricing mechanisms. This can involve improving data collection systems, building better institutional capacity, and ensuring the independence of regulatory authorities. 4. Financial incentives: Offer financial aid, in the form of grants or low-interest loans, to third countries adopting market pricing mechanisms. This can also involve offering financial support to alleviate the impact of fuel price adjustments on vulnerable populations. 5. Monitoring and evaluation: Establish systems to monitor and evaluate the implementation of market pricing mechanisms and their effectiveness in third countries. This can include tracking the development and progress of policies, regular assessments of market conditions, and ensuring compliance with international standards. By promoting market pricing mechanisms in third countries, especially following the discontinuation of state fuel subsidies, a more level playing field can be created for international trade and investment. This, in turn, will lead to increased economic growth, better resource allocation, and reduced negative impacts on the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Process: - Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose during starvation happens, how will it affect more wildlife dies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The given process describes the effects of acid rain on the ecosystem, leading to the eventual death of fish, plants, and other wildlife within the ecosystem. The perturbation hypothesis introduced suggests that during a period of starvation, more wildlife dies. In this context, we will examine whether the supposed perturbation - starvation - has a direct or indirect effect on the process of acid rain impacting the ecosystem. Direct Effects: Starvation itself does not have a direct effect on the process of acid rain formation. Acid rain is primarily caused by the emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from industrial activities, which then mix with the atmosphere and form acidic substances like sulfuric and nitric acids. These acids eventually fall to the ground in rain, snow, or fog, making waters acidic and leading to the cascading negative effects on the ecosystem mentioned in the given process. Starvation in wildlife is not related to the production of acid rain or the chemical process behind its formation, and therefore does not directly affect this process. Indirect Effects: Although starvation does not have a direct effect on the process of acid rain formation, it can indirectly affect the ecosystem and consequently lead to further imbalances. When a large number of animals or organisms die due to starvation, it could potentially exacerbate the effects of acid rain on the ecosystem, making it harder for the ecosystem to recover from the disturbance. 1. Reduction in species diversity: Starvation can lead to the decline or extinction of certain species, reducing the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem. This decrease in biodiversity makes the ecosystem more vulnerable to environmental changes like acid rain. An ecosystem with a higher diversity of species is better equipped to adapt and recover from disturbances, as different species may have different levels of tolerance to acidic conditions, facilitating the recovery of the ecosystem. 2. Disruption of food webs: The death of wildlife due to starvation can alter the food chain dynamics within the ecosystem. When certain species die off in significant numbers, their predators and prey may also be adversely impacted. This can lead to a cascading effect, where other species, not directly affected by the acid rain, suffer the consequences, as their food source diminishes. In this case, the starvation-induced perturbation can indirectly worsen the damage caused by acid rain, as the ecosystem's overall resilience is weakened. 3. Competition for resources: As starvation leads to a reduction in the available food sources, surviving species may face increased competition for the remaining, limited resources. This heightened competition may make it even more challenging for species already stressed by acid rain to survive and thrive in the ecosystem, further exacerbating the negative effects of acid rain. 4. Changes to nutrient cycling: The death of large numbers of wildlife due to starvation can alter the natural nutrient cycling in an ecosystem. As these organisms decompose, their nutrients are released back into the soil. In a balanced ecosystem, these nutrients would be taken up by plants and other organisms, maintaining the balance of nutrient availability. However, in an unbalanced ecosystem impacted by acid rain, these additional nutrients may not be utilized effectively. This could lead to a further decline in the health and functioning of the ecosystem. In conclusion, while starvation does not directly impact the process of acid rain formation, it can indirectly affect the overall health and balance of the ecosystem under consideration. The cumulative effects of starvation, combined with acid rain, can lead to an even greater disturbance in the ecosystem, magnifying the detrimental impacts of acid rain and leading to further problems for the wildlife and the ecosystem as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Those called Judy and Joshua are the happiest, while Lynn or Ben is likely to be the unhappiest, according to research. Psychologist Dr David Holmes found that this might due to the association that others made with the name. Hearing the name Judy may make them think of actress Judi Dench or TV presenter Judy Finnigan, people who are seen as good natured and happy. On the other hand, people think Paulines are unhappy because of the character Pauline Fowler from the TV programme East Enders.

Answer the following question about this sentence: I burst into a fit of laughter. What is the effect? Choose your answer from: [1]. My teeth began to chatter.. [2]. My eyes welled up with tears..","completion":"[2]. My eyes welled up with tears. The effect of bursting into a fit of laughter, as described in the sentence \\"I burst into a fit of laughter,\\" is that one's eyes may well up with tears. This option is more closely related to the act of laughing than the first option, as laughter can sometimes be so intense and overwhelming that it causes the individual to tear up. When a person laughs, their facial muscles contract, and their body undergoes several physiological changes. One such change includes the increase in tear production as the lacrimal glands are stimulated. These glands are responsible for producing tears that help to keep the eyes lubricated and nourished. As laughter intensifies, the tear production may increase, causing the eyes to well up with tears. This can manifest as a physical response to the release of emotions, stress, or simply amusement due to a humorous trigger. The first option, \\"My teeth began to chatter,\\" is less likely to be the effect of bursting into laughter. Teeth chattering is typically associated with shivering or experiencing cold temperatures, which cause involuntary muscle contractions in the body, including the jaw muscles. This response can also occur during times of extreme fear or anxiety. While it could be theoretically possible for someone to experience teeth chattering when laughing, it is not a common or typical consequence of laughter and seems less related to the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paul, Geri, and Carol spend the afternoon at a carnival. While waiting in line for ice cream, Paul is pick-pocketed by five gang members: Nirvana (Thomas F. Duffy), PunkCut (E. Lamont Johnson), Stomper (Kevyn Major Howard), Cutter (Laurence Fishburne) and Jiver (Stuart K. Robinson). He catches up with Jiver, who denies taking Paul's wallet. Paul lets him go. Geri leaves to do an interview while Carol and Paul go on a boat ride. The five gang members break into Paul's house and gang rape the maid, Rosario (Silvana Gallardo), then wait for Kersey. When Paul arrives home with his daughter, he is beaten unconscious. Rosario tries to call the police, but a mugger hits her with a crowbar, killing her. They kidnap Carol, take her to their hideout, and begin to rape her. She jumps through a window in an attempt to escape, and dies after impaling herself on railings below. When the police arrive, Lt. Mankewicz (Ben Frank) asks for help identifying the muggers, but Paul refuses. After the funeral, he takes a .380 Beretta 84 handgun to a low-rent inner city apartment as a base of operations. The next night he spots Stomper and follows him into an abandoned building as a drug deal is about to be made. Kersey kills one of the dealers, then orders the others out and proceeds to execute Stomper. The following night, patrolling the streets, he hears a scream from a couple being assaulted by several muggers in a parking garage. One of the muggers is Jiver. Paul intercedes, killing two and wounding Jiver. Paul follows Jiver's blood trail and shoots him in the head with a .45 M1911A1 pistol. The LAPD and NYPD hear about the murders.

However it said the \\"vast majority\\", and all UK publications, had refused. The palace says in recent months, photographers have: It said the most recent incident, which was last week, involved a photographer who was discovered by police lying down in the boot of a rented car attempting to shoot photos outside a children's play area. Nicholas Witchell, BBC royal correspondent The palace hopes that by drawing attention to the way in which these photographs are being obtained, the readerships of these magazines will bring pressure to bear on the publishers to stop printing them. It says it wants to instigate a \\"public discussion\\" which will help publishers of what they call \\"unauthorised photos of children\\" to understand their responsibilities better.

He said: \\"It is of course upsetting that such tactics - reminiscent as they are of past surveillance by groups intent on doing more than capturing images - are being deployed to profit from the image of a two-year-old boy. \\"In a heightened security environment such tactics are a risk to all involved. \\"The worry is that it will not always be possible to quickly distinguish between someone taking photos and someone intending to do more immediate harm.\\" Mr Knauf said the duke and duchess wanted Prince George and his sister Princess Charlotte \\"to be free to play in public and semi-public spaces with other children without being photographed\\".

Clippers fans with a 'larger than life' performance at a rally, the former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced that he is stepping down from the company's board. Ballmer's decision brings to a close 34 years with the software giant. He said he plans to devote more time not only to his new basketball team, but also civic contributions, teaching and study. Microsoft published Ballmer's resignation letter on its website on Tuesday along with a response from current CEO Satya Nadella thanking him and wishing him well. Scroll down for video. Something to shout about: After 34 years at Microsoft, former CEO Steve Ballmer has announced that he is stepping down to focus on his latest role as the owner of the L.A. Clippers. The 58-year-old says he plans to hold on to his Microsoft stock and will continue to offer feedback on products and strategy. With 333.3 million shares worth 15 billion, Ballmer's 4 percent stake in the company makes him the largest individual holder of Microsoft shares. A few institutional investors hold slightly more. ‘I bleed Microsoft - have for 34 years and I always will,’ Ballmer wrote. ‘I will be proud, and I will benefit through my share ownership. I promise to support and encourage boldness by management in my role as a shareholder in any way I can.’ Ballmer stepped down as chief executive in February, and since then Microsoft shares have risen about 24 percent. He says his resignation from the board is timely as the company prepares for its next shareholder meeting set for sometime this fall. Nadella thanked Ballmer for his support during the transition period and used the opportunity to reiterate the company's new focus on mobile devices and cloud computing. Ballmer's enthusiasm was clear to see, with the Clippers' new owner even chest-bumping fans. New Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, center, fires up the crowd as he speaks at the Clippers Fan Festival on Monday in Los Angeles. ‘Under your leadership, we created an incredible foundation that we continue to build on - and Microsoft will thrive in the mobile-first, cloud-first world,’ Nadella said. Ballmer made a memorable entrance at the Staples Center on Monday evening. With Eminem's Lose Yourself playing over the PA, he made his way through the crowd exchanging high-fives and chest-bumping as he took the stage in front of 4,500 fans. Ballmer paid a record 2 billion for the team in a sale that was confirmed by a judge last week. The name of disgraced former owner Donald Sterling, who controlled the team for 33 years before being banned for life by the NBA for racist remarks, was never uttered during the rally. 'We're looking forward,' Ballmer proclaimed, having removed his blue Clippers hat. 'Everything is about looking forward.' Ballmer's fervor was in stark contrast to Sterling, who never spoke to the media and was famously frugal when it came to spending on the team during decades of losing - despite having amassed a fortune through real estate. 'Today is about this other guy who just happened to have two billion dollars in his pocket,' coach Doc Rivers joked on stage. 'I asked him are you sure it went through and he said, \\"I know my bank account is minus two billion so I know something went through.\\"' Satisfied: Ballmer applauds after his rousing speech, which he gave to a crowd of around 4,500 people. An enthusiastic Ballmer, right, shakes hands with head coach Doc Rivers after speaking at the Clippers Fan Festival. Ballmer gave out his email address during the televised rally and was quick to assure fans he won't move the team to Seattle, where he's lived for 34 years. He was nearly an NBA owner last year before league owners chose to keep the Kings in Sacramento, rather than allow them to be sold to a group that included Ballmer and moved to Seattle. 'I love Los Angeles,' he said. 'Yes, I live in Seattle. We're not moving the Clippers to Seattle for a hundred reasons.' Ballmer used a microphone, but his booming voice easily filled the arena without it. He prowled the stage and gestured to make his points in the enthusiastic style he was known for among Microsoft employees. 'We're going to be bold. Bold means taking chances,' he said. 'We're going to be optimistic. We're going to be hard-core. Nothing gets in our way, boom! The hard-core Clippers, that's us.' Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan were among eight players on hand, along with Rivers, who guided the Clippers to 57 wins last season, his first with the team. 'When he came through the crowd, I literally had goose bumps,' Griffin said afterward. 'I don't know if there's one good word to describe him. I know all our guys are excited about the energy he brings. It's completely different.' Ballmer took a few emailed questions from season ticket-holders, including a 26-year fan who asked how the next 26 years of the franchise would be different. 'I'll boldly say the Clippers will win many, many more Larrys in the next 26 years than they did in the last 26,' he said, referring to the Larry O'Brien trophy that goes to the NBA champion. Rivers clearly got a kick out of Ballmer's passionate display, cracking up at his new boss' proclamations after having previously seen him only on YouTube. Ballmer, center, fires up the crowd as he arrives at the Fan Festival. Ballmer listens to questions from the media during a news conference held after the Clippers Fan Festival. 'I love energy,' Rivers said later. 'You get caught up in that and that's good. That was great for our fans.' Interim CEO Dick Parsons testified during the court battle over the team's sale that Rivers would quit if Sterling was the owner going into next season. 'Sometimes you do have to take a stand,' Rivers said. 'I didn't think I was going to have to (quit), but a lot of us were willing to for sure.' He added, 'You always have to move on. I have.' Ballmer gave the title 'owner emeritus' to Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, who negotiated the deal. She will receive two floor seats, 10 other seats and parking at Staples Center for games. 'Without her this deal does not get done,' Rivers said afterward. 'She wants to be a fan. She's no longer the owner. I'm fine with that.' Ballmer shared dinner with Rivers and some of the players a night earlier, when the discussion focused on where he'll sit during games. Sterling sat at mid-court within earshot of the players. When someone suggested behind the Clippers' bench, like Dallas owner Mark Cuban does, Rivers said, 'I don't know if I could deal with that energy.'

It usually takes one to two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The father giant water bug jumps around to make sure the growing eggs get enough air and water. All this time he can't fly because of the weight of the eggs growing rapidly on his back. Now let's turn to the male stickleback fish. When the mother leaves after laying her eggs, the father tends his young. If the young fish go too far away, their father helps with their safe return by carrying them back in his mouth.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948? from the following article ? In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did Henry...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What animals' flock makes a call and answer in sequence? is inside the article: The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There is a variety of contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflection to signify its return to the nest to its mate., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The animal described in the article is the Australian raven. This bird species exhibits a specific communication behavior, where birds make a call and answer sequence if they are temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. This behavior helps them to stay connected and maintain a sense of group cohesion even when they are not directly visible to each other."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What's position made it a suitable base for raids? It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed.

The film opens on 12 April 1945 with the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the succession of Harry Truman to the presidency. In Europe, the Germans are close to surrender, but in the Pacific the bloody battle for Okinawa is still underway and an invasion of the Japanese home islands is not foreseen until the autumn. American battle casualties have almost reached 900,000, with Japanese casualties at 1.1 million, and some 8 million Asian civilians have died in the war that began with Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. The new president knows nothing about the nuclear weapons being developed at Los Alamos, and he must soon decide on whether to use them and how. The US Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, has doubts even about the wisdom of the American fire-bombing raids on Japan. \\"One of these Gadgets [bombs]\\", U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes says, \\"could end the war in one blow.\\" When nuclear physicist Leo Szilard delivers a petition signed by 73 scientists urging the president not to deploy the bomb, Byrnes tells him: \\"You do not spend two billion dollars and then show them [American voters] nothing.\\" The film suggests that Byrnes never mentioned Szilard's visit to the president.

These culinary descriptions pepper most medical textbooks, helping physicians identify often unusual ailments - from harmless birthmarks to sight-threatening conditions. Dr Ritu Lakhtakia, from Sultan Qaboos University in Oman, described these titbits of knowledge in the journal Medical Humanities. She says they were an integral part of her medical degree, making hard scientific facts less dry and huge chunks of biochemical wisdom more palatable. Food imagery has been used in medicine for many years. Here is an easy one to start with. Cafe au lait spots - flat patches of milk-coffee coloured skin are a tell-tale sign of diseases such as neurofibromatosis in which usually non-cancerous masses grow along nerves. More solitary spots can be seen in people without disease too. And visions of fruit can give doctors clues to diseases that are much harder to see. A cherry red spot at the back of the eye suggests the main vessel supplying blood to the eye has been blocked - an emergency situation, which needs immediate medical attention. And harmless birthmarks that look like a splash of a favourite tipple are described in medical text as port wine stains. The relatively common marks are caused by areas of small, abnormal blood vessels and can vary in hue from deep red to purple. About one in 3,000 babies is born with one and laser treatment can help them fade. Grapes crop up in various guises, not just in their alcoholic form. Some bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, that are often present harmlessly on our skin, can resemble bunches of grapes as they grow. The chest X-ray above shows miliary tuberculosis - a form of TB where the disease has spread around the body in a manner that is said to look like a scattering of millet seeds. Some people with tuberculosis can develop masses of bacteria in their lungs. And if you were to inspect them more closely they are said to resemble and have the consistency of soft cheese - medical students learn of them as caseating (cheese-like) granulomas. Dr Lakhtakia says: \\"For me it changed forever the delights of the cheese counter at the delicatessen.\\" She mentions perhaps even less palatable phrases including anchovy sauce - a term used to illustrate the dark pus seen in certain liver abscesses. But more popular treats have not escaped this medical treatment. Chocolate cysts can help diagnose a condition called endometriosis, when tissue behaving like the lining of the womb is found outside the uterus. It can cause the ovaries to fill with a dark fluid akin to chocolate. Yet perhaps most ubiquitous of all is the common beer-belly - used by doctors and patients alike to describe a stomach that has had a few too many. Dr Lakhtakia now uses food to teach her students - often walking round with samples of nutmeg and turmeric to help illustrate some of the more colourful workings of the inner body. She says turmeric can match the urine of patients with severe jaundice, while nutmeg helps illustrate the appearance of congested livers. They need fairly strong stomachs, she says. This article was about:","completion":"This article is about how doctors use food terms and descriptions to help describe different medical conditions in an easy to understand way. For example, there are spots on the skin that they call 'café au lait' because they are the color of coffee with milk - these can be signs of certain diseases. Doctors also talk about a 'cherry red' spot in the eye that can mean there's a big problem with the blood supply to the eye. They also use terms like 'port wine stains' and 'chocolate cysts' to describe some birthmarks and medical conditions. Even bacteria can be described as looking like bunches of grapes!

Buy Photo April Miller, right, and Karen Roberts exit the Clerk's office after obtaining their marriage license at the Rowan County Courthouse in Morehead, Ky. Sept. 4, 2015 (Photo: James Crisp; Special to the CJ)Buy Photo With clerk Kim Davis in jail, half a dozen same-sex couples walked out of the Rowan County Courthouse on Friday elated to have marriage licenses in hand after tangling with the Apostolic clerk for months. April Miller, a 54-year-old professor at Morehead State University, raised the form over her head when she emerged with her longtime partner, Karen Roberts, and shouted “we got it” to the roar of supporters demonstrating on the courthouse lawn. Surrounded by media cameras, James Yates and William Smith Jr. leaned into a long, tearful embrace after their sixth attempt to obtain the paperwork proved successful, even as Davis’ legal team asserted that they were invalid. The crowd chanted “love has won” as the couple hugged Yates’ parents outside. “This means, at least for this area, that civil rights are civil rights,” Yates said. But the licenses also brought derision, including from one religious protester who called out “perverts” as Tim and Michael Long applied for the papers. The couple held a commitment ceremony in 2008 and changed their names but were denied the ability to legally marry. Tim Long said the day carried great significance, and he felt “like we are accepted, like everyone else.” He said he was sorry that Davis is in jail “but she done it to herself.” “We waited for years and years and years,” Long said. “I just thought it would never happen.” It came a day after Davis was jailed for contempt by a federal judge and remained there after refusing a deal that would have allowed her to avoid incarceration while her office issued licenses. Most of her deputies had agreed to issue the licenses Friday at the Morehead courthouse, which opened at 8 a.m. and had already drawn 100 demonstrators on both sides of the issue as well as dozens of media outlets from around the country. Among those at the courthouse was Kim Davis’ husband, Joe Davis, who called U.S. District Judge David Bunning a bully for jailing his wife. He said she was in good spirits, has no intention of resigning and is prepared for months in jail. Later in the day, Liberty Counsel, the group representing Davis, said at a news conference outside the Carter County Jail that the licenses issued Friday were “not worth the paper they are written on” because Davis has refused to provide them with her name. While she locked up inside the jail, she still has a free conscience, they said. At the courthouse, deputy clerk Brian Mason, who issued licenses to six same-sex couples and two heterosexual couples before the office closed at 6 p.m., said he wasn’t certain if the forms, which did not bear Davis' name, were valid. “I can’t guarantee nothing,” he said. But those who got licenses were confident they would be honored. As couples arrived at the courthouse Friday, about 10 police officers were keeping the two groups of demonstrators apart as emotions again ran high. Some of the ire of Davis' supporters was directed toward Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, who has declined to call a special session to rewrite state law on marriage certificates, and his son Andy Beshear, who is running for attorney general. Davis’ supporters said a rally is planned at 11 a.m. Saturday outside the jail. Some criticized the deputy clerks for agreeing to issue the licenses. “I think everybody in that office should have stood behind Kim Davis,” said Penny Stinnett, who accused the deputy clerks of backing down and selling “out their salvation.” On the other side, Marsha Moore-Charles, pastor of Bluegrass United Church of Christ, said that while new civil rights are often slow to be accepted by some, the “onslaught of bigotry and prejudice” that has followed the Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage has been “heartbreaking.” Some said they hoped Friday’s events marked a turning point. Morehead resident Jerry Calvert, who wore a “Make cornbread, not war” T-shirt, called it a “good day,” saying “it’s about everybody being OK, living together.” Others, however, said the battle over gay marriage likely wouldn’t be over anytime soon. Indeed, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee was reportedly planning to visit Davis next Tuesday during a rally of supporters outside the jail. He has called her jailing “the criminalization of Christianity.” Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1UwDW9D ||||| James Yates, left, hugs his partner William Smith Jr., after receiving their marriage license at the Rowan County Judicial Center in Morehead, Ky., Friday, Sept. 4, 2015. Deputy clerk Brian Mason issued... (Associated Press) GRAYSON, Ky. (AP) — Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will spend Labor Day weekend in isolation at the Carter County Detention Center with her Bible and her clear conscience. At least three same-sex couples will spend the weekend planning weddings after finally receiving the marriage licenses they asked for months ago but were denied because Davis believes gay marriage is a sin. The Rowan County Clerk's office issued the licenses to same-sex couples on Friday under threat of jail time or fines if they didn't comply with a federal judge's order. While the licenses were freely given, the drama surrounding the clerk does not appear to be ending anytime soon. Davis met with her attorneys in jail Friday and told them she would \\"never violate her conscience or betray her God.\\" U.S. District Judge David Bunning has said he will not release Davis unless she agrees to obey his order. Davis' attorneys said the only way she would relent would be to change Kentucky's state law so that marriage licenses are not issued under the authority of the county clerk. They claim the licenses that were issued were not valid. The state legislature will not meet again until January. Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear has refused to call a special session, arguing it would waste taxpayer money to bring the legislature back on an issue that so far only affects one elected official. That means Davis could potentially be in jail for months until the state legislature has a chance to change the law early next year. Davis' supporters are not backing down. They planned a \\"Free Kim Davis\\" rally in front of the jail on Saturday and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said he planned to meet with Davis on Tuesday. Kim Davis' husband, Joe, said his wife will stay in jail how \\"ever how long it takes,\\" noting that she has held a Bible study at the Rowan County Detention Center every Monday night for the past few years. \\"She's not going to resign, she's not going to sacrifice her conscience, so she's doing what Martin Luther King Jr. wrote about in his Letter from the Birmingham Jail, which is to pay the consequences for her decision,\\" said Mat Staver, one of Davis' attorneys and founder of the Florida-based legal group Liberty Counsel. Davis' attorneys said the licenses issued Friday are not \\"worth the paper they are written on\\" because Davis did not authorize them. But attorneys for the gay couples who sued her along with the elected Rowan County attorney said the licenses were valid. U.S. District Judge David Bunning said he did not know if the licenses were valid but ordered them issued anyway. Gay couples who arrived at the Rowan County Courthouse on Friday said they were sad that Davis was in jail. But they were determined not to let her ruin their celebrations. James Yates and William Smith were the first couple through the door, pushing through a thick scrum of cameras and microphones to pay 35.50 for a marriage license. They embraced through tears once the deputy clerk, Brian Mason, handed the form back to them and told them \\"congratulations.\\" Yates, with Smith clutching his arm, dashed across the courtyard to hug his mother. \\"Civil rights are civil rights and they are not subject to belief,\\" said Yates, who had been denied a license five times previously. Dozens of protesters on both sides filled the courtyard with sound systems and signs, and a few even made their way inside to heckle gay couples. Timothy and Michael Long did not respond when a man wearing a white dress shirt and a black tie called them perverts as they were filling out their license. The couple had a commitment ceremony seven years ago but wanted to make their marriage official. April Miller and Karen Roberts, the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit that landed Davis behind bars, got their license around midday. Miller emerged in the bright sunshine holding her license above her head while Roberts let out a joyous whoop as supporters cheered. \\"Now we can breathe. I'm still ecstatic and happy. I just can't wait to get married now,\\" Roberts said. ||||| Buy Photo Supporters of Kim Davis chant in support of the Rowan County clerk after Davis denied marriage licenses to two same sex couples Tuesday morning. (September 1, 2015) (Photo: Tim Webb, Special to The C-J)Buy Photo Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis is reading the Bible in her jail cell and sleeping with a clear conscience, the head of her legal team said Friday after speaking with her at the Carter County Detention Center. Mat Staver, founder and chairman of the Liberty Counsel, said the clerk has remained in good spirits and told attorneys that “all is well” despite the federal contempt charge that resulted in her arrest Thursday. “She will never violate her conscience and never betray her God,” he said. “She is prepared for the consequences ... and that’s why she is here.” U.S. District Judge David Bunning ordered Davis into federal custody Thursday when she twice refused to heed a preliminary injunction requiring her to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. But Staver on Friday called the hearing \\"a charade\\" and said he expects her to remain behind bars at least into next week. He described her as a woman of “incredible resilience and incredible faith” who has no intention of resigning. Davis’ lawyers are appealing the contempt ruling to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals and plan to file writs of habeas corpus in efforts to free her from jail. “We will not allow her to just continually sit here and have her constitutional rights violated and her conscience trampled by what happened yesterday,” Staver said, citing the First Amendment and Kentucky’s Religious Freedom Act. Although deputy clerks in her office issued marriage forms to multiple couples Friday, Davis continues to withhold her authority. And Staver argues that any licenses granted Friday are “not worth the paper they are written on” because they lack her say-so. Staver said Davis still has a deep respect for her deputies, who are providing forms over her direction. She understands that they were threatened with arrest and has no animosity toward them, he said. Staver also repeated criticism of Gov. Steve Beshear, who has declined to call a special session for rewriting state marriage law. Supporters of Davis contend that her beliefs could be accommodated through changes to the forms and state statute. Davis has asked lawmakers for the changes since January. Demonstrators plan to rally for Davis outside the detention center at 3 p.m. Tuesday, reportedly with an appearance from GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. A separate event — “The Kim Davis Jailhouse Prayer Rally” — is scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday at the center. A flier circulated Friday urges officials to “free Kim Davis — Kentucky hero” and calls for Bunning's impeachment. Staver said the Liberty Counsel has been contacted by other clerks in Kentucky but that lawyers haven’t talked to them since Thursday’s hearing. Two others are denying licenses in Casey and Whitley counties.

Q:TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: One day, a man found the cocoon of a butterfly and he brought it home. A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little - then fly!

However, it does not necessarily mean that Julius was cheerful directly because \\"it was a pity for them.\\" The cheerfulness could be coming from a completely unrelated aspect of Julius's day or life, and the acknowledgement of the other person's situation can simply be an observation, empathy, or even a sense of relief that it happened to someone else and not himself. The statement could also indicate that Julius expressed his empathy or sympathy in a cheerful manner, either to lighten the mood, to appear flippant or unserious about the situation, or because being cheerful is just his natural way of communication. In summary, the statement implies that Julius was cheerful while expressing his thoughts on the unfortunate circumstances faced by another person or group, but it doesn't directly mean that Julius was cheerful because they experienced the pity.

Write some highlights for the following article: Lion, the latest version of Apple's operating software for its Mac computers, was released to the public on Wednesday. It's an update that continues to blur the line between software on mobile devices and desktop computers. Marking the eighth major release of new software for Apple computers, Mac OS X Lion offers 250 new features, according to the company. With multi-touch gesturing, full-screen app display and access to the Mac App Store built directly into the software, the system was clearly designed to make working on a Mac more similar to working on an iPad. \\"Lion is the best version of OS X yet, and we're thrilled that users around the world can download it starting today,\\" said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, said in a written statement. \\"Lion makes upgrading a Mac easier than ever before; just launch the Mac App Store, buy Lion with your iTunes account, and the download and install process will begin automatically.\\" Walt Mossberg of All Things Digital called Lion Apple's \\"most radical new MacIntosh operating system in years,\\" calling it a \\"giant step in the merger of the personal computer and post-PC devices like tablets and smartphones.\\" The new system, however, does not run iPhone or iPad apps (at least, not yet) and it does run Adobe Flash -- something Steve Jobs and company have summarily banished from their mobile devices. Its touch features use a touchpad, making them similar, but not exactly the same, as what iPhone and iPad users may be used to on their touchscreens. Mossberg said he likes the system, but warned that new users may suffer during their transition. \\"Switching to Lion will require a major adjustment even for veteran Mac users, though it will be easier for those who use iPhones or iPads,\\" he wrote. \\"Lion will significantly increase the learning curve for Windows users switching to the Mac.\\" Brian X. Chen of Wired wrote that \\"some of Lion's iOS-like features scale up very well, while others behave very poorly in a desktop environment.\\" He found the software's iPad-like scrolling feature distracting and dizzying (he eventually disabled it) but said he enjoyed the system's app-opening full-screen mode and praised new sharing and auto-save functions. Mac OS X Lion is available as a 29.99 upgrade for people with the latest version of the Snow Leopard operating system. It will be available at Apple Stores in August for 69.99. Lion is the latest in a long line of cat-named operating systems rolled out by Apple for its computers. Past versions have included Cheetah, Puma, Jaguar, Panther, Tiger, Leopard and Snow Leopard. Whether the king of the jungle marks the last version of feline-named software remains to be seen -- but we're still holding out hope for Jaguarundi. Highlights:","completion":"1.

I never write reviews, but I feel it is my responsibility to share my experience so others don't fall victim to what I encountered. Firstly, the service was abysmal. Upon arrival, the hostess took about 15 minutes to acknowledge us, despite staff being available and standing around talking. We were finally seated, but it took another 20 minutes for a server to come and take our drink orders. Throughout our entire meal, the server was inattentive and seemed disinterested in providing adequate customer service. Refilling water or providing bread was like pulling teeth. I couldn't believe how poorly we were treated. The atmosphere was also dismal. The lighting was too dim, making it difficult to see the menu and giving the place a creepy vibe. The music was too loud and obnoxious, making conversation challenging. Furthermore, the tables were crammed together, leaving very little privacy and comfort. Now to the food: it was absolutely horrendous. The appetizer we ordered, which was supposed to be a beautiful bruschetta with ripe tomatoes and fresh basil, turned out to be tasteless, mushy and drenched in an unappetizing amount of oil. The bread wasn't even toasted and just fell apart when you tried to scoop up the topping. The main courses were somehow worse. My chicken entrée was dry and overcooked, while my spouse's pasta dish was undercooked and swimming in a pool of watery sauce that had a weird, sharp taste we couldn’t quite place. We also had to send a side dish back because it arrived cold and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. The prices were completely unjustified considering the quality of food and service. I felt cheated and deceived by the glowing reviews and beautiful photos I saw online prior to visiting this establishment. I rarely give one-star reviews, but this place truly deserves every bit of criticism it gets. The poor service, lackluster atmosphere, and horrendous food make it an establishment I genuinely hope adopts some serious changes or shuts down altogether. Save your money and time and go elsewhere.

But don't count the CEO out of the running just yet. As of this article's writing, Spears leads at 767,936 followers, but Page is still within shooting range at 760,331 followers of his own. The official ousting of Page by Spears allegedly occurred this past Monday. It took spears just over two months since the July launch of Google Plus to hit the big 100,000 follower mark, and just around ten days after that to quadruple her count. According to the website Social Statistics, she currently follows around one person for every 178 followers that add her to one of their own Google Plus circles. Page only needed around a half or month or so to reach his first 100,000 followers, but it took him around two months to quadruple that figure.

Perhaps the better question is, \\"When?\\" Or even, \\"What,\\" as in, \\"What will these users do once they've followed their favorite celebrities?\\" Google announced in October that the service had surpassed the 40-million-user mark (after soft-launching in late June and officially opening up signups in late September), but that's a count of total signups, not active Google Plus users. Google has yet to disclose that number, and tech pundits have been suggesting it's a sign that actual user engagement on the platform is a lot lower than Google wants to currently admit. Ask Google reps, however, and you'll get a different answer: \\"It's a number we're very happy with,\\" said Vic Gundotra, senior vice president of engineering at Google, in an interview with ReadWriteWeb's Richard MacManus.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor. PUBLISHED:. 08:49 EST, 3 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 09:42 EST, 3 June 2013. Banks have cut the amount of money they have made available for loans despite taking billions from the government which was supposed to trigger a boom in lending. Total lending by banks and building societies fell by £300million in the first three months of 2013, leaving struggling small businesses ‘out in the cold’. However some of the biggest names on the high street have received billions of pounds from George Osborne’s Funding for Lending scheme, including the banks owned by the taxpayer. Net lending from some of Britain's biggest banks fell in the first three months of 2013, new figures show. New figures from the Bank of England reveal the slump in lending, renewing fears that the economy will struggle to grow if businesses are unable to access cheap and easy credit. Lloyds Banking Group – 39 per cent owned by the British taxpayer - lent almost £1 billion less from January to March, despite taking £3 billion from the Bank of England and Treasury scheme. A spokesman for Llyods said: 'The acid test for the Funding for Lending Scheme's success is whether we are lending to SMEs and First Time Buyers. 'We have been growing our SME lending by 4% a year, on a net basis, and we have also pledged to increase our new lending to first time buyers to £6.5bn in 2013 compared to £6bn last year. 'But as part of our effort to focus on these fundamental parts of the economy we are running down certain ‘non-core’ parts of our business. 'The decline in our overall lending in the first three months of 2013 as reported in the latest Bank of England figures, is entirely the result of this shift in focus and the figures show a reducing rate of decline, which demonstrates the progress we are making towards achieving overall growth in our lending this year.' Taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland also shrunk its net lending by £1.6 billion in the quarter, but has borrowed £750 million from the Funding for Lending scheme. The Bank of England said lending to homeowners has been positive but continues to fall to business. It added it will ‘take time’ for the scheme to feed through to bigger lending volumes. The Funding for Lending scheme has so far given £16.5billion to 40 participating lenders. But their lending has shrunk by a net £1.8 billion since the scheme was launched in August. Write caption here. Paul Fisher, executive director for markets at the Bank, said the net lending fall was ‘broadly as expected’. He added: ‘The plans of the FLS participants suggest that net lending volumes will pick up gradually through the remainder of 2013.’ There had been an increase in mortgage lending homebuyers but credit to businesses has ‘mostly been negative’. Spanish-owned bank Santander cut its net lending by £2.3 billion as it continued its retreat from riskier parts of the mortgage market. The FLS was recently beefed up to extend more loans to credit-starved small businesses after criticism over its impact. The scheme offers lenders discounted loans in return for boosting the flow of credit to the economy. The pace of lending decline slowed from a net £2.4 billion decrease in the final three months of 2012, and the Bank said net lending should pick up and turn ‘modestly positive’ over the rest of the year. Since last August banks have received billions of pounds from George Osborne's Funding for Lending scheme. Barclays, which has borrowed £6 billion from the FLS, increased its lending by £1.1 billion during the quarter. Nationwide Building Society also hiked its lending by £1.2 billion after drawing £2.5 billion from the scheme. There were also major credit injections from firms including Tesco Bank, Virgin Money and Coventry Building Society. But the scheme was criticised for failing to boost credit to businesses. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ‘The real test for Funding for Lending is whether it is able to get credit flowing to young and fast-growing businesses. ‘Unfortunately many of these growth firms are still being left out in the cold when it comes to accessing finance, which prevents them from expanding, creating jobs and helping to drive a business-led recovery.’ TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ‘The Funding for Lending scheme is not providing the support small businesses need in these tough economic times. ‘It seems that some banks are just using the Funding for Lending to improve their capital position. ‘This is why we need a properly resourced state investment bank that can provide the assistance firms need to grow and create jobs.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"This article is about banks getting money from the government to give out more loans, but they didn't give out as many loans as expected. This has left some small businesses struggling because they can't get the money they need to grow. Lloyds Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland are two big banks that took money from the government but didn't give out as many loans. The Bank of England said that the amount of loans being given out might increase over time, but some people are unhappy with the situation because it's not helping small businesses the way it was supposed to."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Convex lense bend toward principle axis why? Why does a ball when hit towards mid-wicket start bending towards square leg and when hit towards cover starts bending towards point (irrespective of whether it is on the ground or in the air)? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"While these two questions may seem similar, they are actually different because they involve distinct principles of physics in separate contexts. Let's look at each question separately to explain in detail. 1. Convex lenses and the bending of light toward the principal axis: A convex lens is a type of lens that has outward-curving surfaces and is thicker at the center than at the edges. Its ability to bend light towards the principal axis is due to the principles of refraction and lens geometry. Refraction is the phenomenon that occurs when light passes through different media with different refractive indices, causing the light to change direction. The index of refraction is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to that in the medium. Lenses are usually made of materials with a higher refractive index than the surrounding air. In the case of a convex lens, light enters the lens and slows down as it moves from the air to the denser medium (e.g., glass or plastic). According to Snell's Law, the angle of refraction is related to the angle of incidence, as well as the refractive indices of the two media. As the lens's surfaces curve outward, they cause the light rays to refract, and since the lens is thicker at the center, the rays entering the center part of the lens are bent more than those entering at the edge. As a result, the refracted rays converge to a point on the principal axis. This creates a real or virtual image, depending on the position of the object relative to the lens's focal length. 2. Ball bending in cricket: When a ball is hit towards mid-wicket and starts bending towards square-leg, or when it is hit towards cover and starts bending towards point, the effect is due to both the spin on the ball and the air resistance it encounters. These factors cause the path of the ball to curve as it travels through the air, a phenomenon known in physics as the Magnus effect. The Magnus effect is named after the physicist Heinrich Magnus and is caused by the interaction of the spinning ball with the airflow around it. When a cricket ball is hit with a certain spin, the asymmetrical circulation of air around the ball generates a pressure difference between the side moving against the air and the side moving with the air. For example, consider a right-handed batsman hitting the ball towards mid-wicket with a counterclockwise spin (upper side of the ball spinning forward). The spin creates a difference in air pressure, with higher pressure on the right side of the ball than on the left side. This pressure difference generates a force that pushes the ball towards square leg. The same principle applies when the ball is hit towards cover with a clockwise spin, causing it to bend towards point. In conclusion, while both questions involve the bending of paths, they address different principles of physics. The first question pertains to refraction in a convex lens, and the second question refers to the Magnus effect influencing the path of a spinning cricket ball. Although both phenomena involve bending, they occur in separate contexts and are therefore not the same question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.

Before meeting Christine, this man had been in a short relationship with another lady named Natalie, who was also the mother of a little girl named Tia. This is important to remember. The man had a difficult life before meeting Christine. He spent time in places called care, where people look after you, but sometimes it's because you can't be with your family. He also spent time on the streets, which means he didn't have a home to stay in, and he was in jail, which is a place people go when they do something wrong and have to be away from others for a while. Christine felt sorry for him because of all the hard times he had been through. She thought that being with her could help him become a better person.

Answer the question about text: Needless to say we needed to wait for housekeeping to come and clean up the room , which by the time it was done it was very late and we had been up since 5 am . We did get a slight discount on the cost of the 1st night . One day we walked into our room to find a boys underwear sitting on our luggage , we did n't have any boys in our room and they were n't my sisters sons underwear . Anyway .... Why did the narrator not immediately go to sleep in their room ?","completion":"The narrator did not immediately go to sleep in their room because upon arrival, they found that the room was not clean and in a suitable condition for them to use. This necessitated waiting for the housekeeping staff to arrive and properly clean the room before they could settle in and rest. As they mentioned, they had been awake since 5 am, which implies that they were quite exhausted and looking forward to resting. However, the state of the room hindered them from immediately going to sleep as they desired. Additionally, the process of waiting for the housekeeping staff and getting the room cleaned took a significant amount of time, causing further delays since it had to be done during the late hours. This suggests that the poor initial maintenance of the room and the subsequent delay caused by the cleaning process prevented the narrator from going to sleep right away. Furthermore, the fact that the narrator mentioned receiving a slight discount on the cost of the first night signifies that they were not completely satisfied with the quality of service during their stay. It seems that they had to complain about the situation and negotiate a discount, and this process could have also contributed to their inability to immediately go to sleep in their room. Their experience of finding someone else's underwear on their luggage later on also hints at potential lapses in the attention paid to the overall cleanliness and upkeep of the room. In conclusion, the narrator did not immediately go to sleep in their room because, upon arrival, they discovered that the room was not clean and properly prepared for their stay, causing them to wait for the housekeeping staff to rectify the situation. The time-consuming process and subsequent dissatisfaction with the overall service further exacerbated the delay, preventing them from going to sleep as soon as they would have liked."},{"prompt":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how many wives did henry the 8th have Suggested answer: His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive, educated and accomplished king, and he has been described as \\"one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne\\".

Given the question: Information: - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways. - The Straits of Florida, Florida Straits, or Florida Strait is a strait located south-southeast of the North American mainland, generally accepted to be between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Florida Keys (U.S.) and Cuba. It is 150 km (93 mi) wide at the narrowest point between Key West and the Cuban shore, and has been sounded to a depth of 6,000 feet. The strait carries the Florida Current, the beginning of the Gulf Stream, from the Gulf of Mexico. - South Florida is a region of the U.S. state of Florida, comprising the southernmost part of the state. It is one of Florida's three most common \\"directional\\" regions, the others being Central Florida and North Florida. It includes the populous Miami metropolitan area, the Florida Keys, and other localities. South Florida is the only part of the continental United States with a tropical climate. - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building having multiple floors. When the term was originally used in the 1880s it described a building of 10 to 20 floors but now describes one of at least 40-50 floors.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first initial of the person who didn't believe the story that Cocteau gave about the group taking a cab? At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a \\"Bohemian\\" group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would \\"acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes\\". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: \\"Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ...

Question: Process: - A virus enters a host body - The virus has receptors that lock onto a target cell - The virus enters the cell - The virus uses the cell like a factory to make new copies of the virus - The new copies of the virus leave the cell - Infect other cells - The host gets sick as its cells are damaged. Question: suppose less air enters the lungs happens, how will it affect a SMALLER spread of the virus. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's break down the process step-by-step and consider the possible effects of less air entering the lungs. Step 1 - A virus enters a host body: If less air enters the lungs, there is a chance that fewer viral particles could be inhaled, potentially leading to a lesser degree of initial infection. Step 2 - The virus has receptors that lock onto a target cell: A smaller viral load may result in fewer virus particles attaching to target cells. However, even if fewer viruses are present, they can still lock onto target cells effectively. So this has no effect on the virus's ability to attach. Step 3 - The virus enters the cell: Regardless of the initial viral load, the virus can still enter the cells efficiently. Thus, there is no effect on this step. Step 4 - The virus uses the cell like a factory to make new copies of the virus: Even with fewer viruses entering cells, they can still use the host's cellular machinery to replicate. While it may produce a smaller number of new viral particles due to the initial lesser degree of infection, the overall replication process is still effective. Therefore, it might have less effect on this step. Step 5 - The new copies of the virus leave the cell: Fewer new viral particles produced may result in slower spreading within the host's body. This has a less effect on the viral spread in this step. Step 6 - Infect other cells: With fewer new viral particles present, the spread of the virus might be slower, leading to a smaller number of additional cells being infected. This results in a less effect on the infection of other cells. Step 7 - The host gets sick as its cells are damaged: As fewer viral particles are present and the spread may be slower, the host may experience less severe symptoms or a delay in the onset of symptoms. This has a less effect on the host getting sick. In conclusion, if less air enters the lungs, it could result in a smaller virus spread within the host due to a lesser degree of initial infection, slower replication, and a smaller number of new viral particles produced. The overall effect on the process is less, as the initial perturbation influences the rate of infection, replication, and spread, but does not fundamentally change the virus's ability to enter and infect cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of Ellis' relative that lives in Washington DC?, using the article: Fifteen-year-old Ellis Whitman is leaving his home in Tucson, Arizona, for his freshman year at Gates Academy, an East Coast prep school. He leaves behind Wendy, his flaky, New Age mother and Goat Man, a weed-smoking goat trekker and botanist. Goat Man is the only real father Ellis has ever known, since his biological father, Frank, left when he was a baby. Upon arriving Gates Academy, Ellis befriends his roommate Barney Cannel, a cross-country runner, and Rosenberg, who usually does not get anything higher than a C in his classes, but is smart enough to sneak in marijuana. Ellis also takes an interest in Minnie, a local girl who works in the school library; his friends often refer to her as a prostitute, according to rumors. Meanwhile, Goat Man and Wendy have been incommunicado, which Barney points out often. On a phone call, Ellis discovers that his mother has a new boyfriend named Bennet, who is rude and disrespectful. One day, Ellis receives a letter in the mail from his long-estranged father from Washington, DC, requesting for Ellis to spend Thanksgiving dinner with him. Ellis decides to fly to Washington with Barney, who is also having Thanksgiving with his mother there. Ellis finally meets his father and his father's pregnant and kind-hearted wife, Judy. One night, Ellis gets a call from Barney telling him that he is in possession of marijuana. Ellis sneaks out for the night, but Frank finds out that he left. On the way back from his flight from DC, Barney and Ellis get drunk and fight with each other in their dorm room, resulting in a dent in the wall which costs Wendy 700 and Ellis to end up in the school hospital.

Review: Yawn, I can imagine teams of Kurt \\"No Brain\\" fans and Hole teeny boppers loving this stuff. Her \\"^%&ing great album\\" (her words) is hard to stay awake to. The first song teamed with its video was a ploy to get people to buy, but the rest of the CD is close to the best of Yoko Ono's melodious work. You'd have to really hate rock to really like this album. I give it 2 stars since I have bought far worse. Is this product review negative? A:","completion":"Yes B: No Step 1: Analyze the content of the review. The reviewer mentions that the album is hard to stay awake to, compares it to Yoko Ono's work (which is implied to be bad), and says you'd have to really hate rock to like it. Step 2: Determine the sentiment of the review. Given the negative statements made in the review and the low rating of 2 stars, it is clear that the reviewer has a negative opinion of the album.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Witchcraft (also called witchery or \\"spellcraft\\") broadly means the practice of, and belief in, magical skills and abilities that are able to be exercised by individuals and certain social groups. Witchcraft is a complex concept that varies culturally and societally; therefore, it is difficult to define with precision and cross-cultural assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious, divinatory or medicinal role, and is often present within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a magical world view. Although witchcraft can often share common ground with related concepts such as sorcery, the paranormal, magic, superstition, necromancy, possession, shamanism, healing, spiritualism, nature worship and the occult, it is usually seen as distinct from these when examined by sociologists and anthropologists. It is said to have been an ancient religion. - The Bricket Wood coven, or Hertfordshire coven was a coven of Gardnerian witches founded in the 1940s by Gerald Gardner. It was notable for being the first coven in the Gardnerian line, though having its supposed origins in the pre-Gardnerian New Forest coven. The coven formed after Gardner bought the Fiveacres Country Club, a naturist club in the village of Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, southern England, and met within the club's grounds. It played a significant part in the history of the neopagan religion of Wicca. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Initiation is a rite of passage marking entrance or acceptance into a group or society. It could also be a formal admission to adulthood in a community or one of its formal components. In an extended sense it can also signify a transformation in which the initiate is 'reborn' into a new role. Examples of initiation ceremonies might include Hindu diksha, Christian baptism or confirmation, Jewish bar or bat mitzvah, acceptance into a fraternal organization, secret society or religious order, or graduation from school or recruit training. A person taking the initiation ceremony in traditional rites, such as those depicted in these pictures, is called an \\"initiate\\". - The Fellowship of Isis (FOI) is an international spiritual organization devoted to promoting awareness of the Goddess. It is dedicated specifically to the Egyptian goddess Isis because the FOI co-founders believed Isis best represented the energies of the dawning Aquarian Age. The FOI is a multi-faith, multi-racial, and multi-cultural organization, and despite worshipping pagan deities, does not consider itself to be a Neopagan faith. - The New Forest coven were an alleged group of Neopagan witches or Wiccans who met around the area of the New Forest in southern England during the 1930s and 1940s. According to his own claims, in September 1939, a British occultist named Gerald Gardner was initiated into the coven, and subsequently used its beliefs and practices as a basis from which he formed the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca. Gardner described some of his experiences with the coven in his published books \\"Witchcraft Today\\" (1954) and \\"The Meaning of Witchcraft\\" (1959), although on the whole revealed little about it, saying he was respecting the privacy of its members. Meanwhile, another occultist, Louis Wilkinson, corroborated Gardner's claims by revealing in an interview with the writer Francis X. King that he too had encountered the coven, and expanded on some of the information that Gardner had provided about them. - Wicca, also termed Pagan Witchcraft, is a contemporary Pagan new religious movement. It was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and was introduced to the public in 1954 by Gerald Gardner, a retired British civil servant. Wicca draws upon a diverse set of ancient pagan and 20th century hermetic motifs for its theological structure and ritual practices. - A Craft name, also known as a magical (or \\"magickal\\") name is a secondary religious name often adopted by practitioners of Wicca and other forms of Neopagan witchcraft or magic. Craft names may be adopted as a means of protecting one's privacy (especially for those who are \\"in the broom closet\\"), as an expression of religious devotion, or as a part of an initiation ritual. It may also be used as a protective method, as it is believed by some that one's \\"true name\\" can be used as a taglock, to identify that person for the purpose of magical activities (predominantly curses). - Frederic Lamond ( born 1931 ) who also goes under the craft name Robert , is a prominent English Wiccan . He was an early member of the Gardnerian tradition having been initiated into the Bricket Wood coven in 1957 . He has since become involved in a number of Pagan organisations , including the Fellowship of Isis , and has participated in the interfaith movement . He has written a number of books on the subject of Wiccan theology and history . - Isis (original Egyptian pronunciation more likely \\"Aset\\" or \\"Iset\\") is a goddess from the polytheistic pantheon of Egypt. She was first worshiped in ancient Egyptian religion, and later her worship spread throughout the Roman Empire and the greater Greco-Roman world. Isis is still widely worshiped by many pagans today in diverse religious contexts; including a number of distinct pagan religions, the modern Goddess movement, and interfaith organizations such as the Fellowship of Isis.

Background: Alan Shearer, CBE, DL (; born 13 August 1970) is an English retired footballer. He played as a striker in the top level of English league football for Southampton, Blackburn Rovers, Newcastle United and the England national team. He is Newcastle's and the Premier League's record goalscorer. Context: In a surprise move, late on 1 April 2009, it was announced that Shearer would become the manager of his former club Newcastle United for the remaining eight games of the season, taking over from head coach Chris Hughton who was in temporary charge while the permanent manager Joe Kinnear recovered from heart surgery, having taken ill on 7 February. Shearer stated \\"It's a club I love and I don't want them to go down. I'll do everything I can to stop that.\\" Shearer was unveiled at a press conference the following day by club managing director Derek Llambias. In explaining his acceptance of a managerial role at Newcastle at this time, Shearer stated that he would not have done this for any other club in this position, including his two other previous Premier League clubs. Amid persistent questioning regarding the permanency of the appointment, Llambias announced that Shearer was to be manager for the remaining eight games, and after his recovery, Joe Kinnear would return as manager after the end of the season. Shearer confirmed that the BBC had agreed to giving him an 8-week sabbatical from his Match of the Day role. Llambias also confirmed Dennis Wise had left his executive role at the club and the club had no plans to appoint a replacement, with Shearer stating that \\"the people that have moved, were moving on anyways, that had nothing to do with me\\". Wise's presence had previously been speculated as being a blockage to any possible appointment of a manager. Shearer accepted the surprise offer on the Monday on the condition that he could bring in Iain Dowie as his assistant. Shearer also brought in Paul Ferris to oversee club medical, physio and dietary matters. Ferris had previously worked with Shearer in his playing days, and had been at the club for 13 years prior to an earlier departure under then manager Glenn Roeder. His first match in charge ended in a 2-0 defeat against Chelsea at St James' Park. On 11 April, Newcastle earned their first point under Shearer with a 1-1 draw with Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium with Andy Carroll scoring a late equalising goal. After a defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and a draw against Portsmouth, his first win for Newcastle came in a 3-1 victory over Middlesbrough that lifted Newcastle from the relegation zone. On the eve of the final day of the season on 24 May, where all fixtures are played simultaneously, Newcastle faced the prospect of being relegated to the Championship, along with Hull City, Middlesbrough and Sunderland, which would end their 16-year unbroken spell in the Premier League. After losing 1-0 at Aston Villa with Damien Duff scoring an own goal, Newcastle were relegated with local rivals Middlesbrough, joining West Bromwich Albion whose relegation had been confirmed in previous weeks, while Sunderland and Hull City survived. Shearer's eight games yielded only five points out of a possible twenty-four. Shearer did not get the manager's job on permanent basis. Chris Hughton stepped up from the coaching staff to take charge of the quest to get Newcastle back into the Premier League, which was achieved at the first attempt as Newcastle finished top of the Championship in the 2009-10 season. Question: During what years was he the manager?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Alan Shearer was the manager of Newcastle United for a short period in 2009.

Title: The Omega Man Movie plot: In 1975, biological warfare between China and Russia kills most of the world's population. U.S. Army Col. Robert Neville, M.D. is a scientist based in Los Angeles. As he begins to succumb to the plague himself, he injects himself with an experimental vaccine, rendering himself immune. By 1977, Neville believes he is the plague's only immune survivor. Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the deserted city of Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of \\"The Family\\", a cult of plague victims who were turned into nocturnal albino mutants. The Family seeks to destroy all technology and kill Neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for humanity's downfall. At night, living atop a fortified apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in his own home. One day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a woman who quickly runs away. He pursues her outside but later decides he is hallucinating and dismisses the sighting. On another day, the Family finally captures Neville. After a summary trial he is found guilty of heresy by the family's leader, Jonathan Matthias, a former news anchorman. Neville is sentenced to death and nearly burned at the stake in Dodger Stadium. He is rescued by Lisa, the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and Dutch, a former medical student. Lisa and Dutch are part of a group of survivors, some of whom are children. Although their youth has given them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it and will eventually succumb to mutation. Neville realizes that even if it is possible to duplicate the original vaccine, it would take years to salvage humanity. However, he believes it may be possible to extend his immunity to others by creating a serum from his own body.

How do proximity sensors and G-sensors differ? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"1. What is a magnetometer sensor? A magnetometer sensor is a type of sensor that can measure the strength and direction of a magnetic field. It is used to detect magnetic materials, determine the Earth's magnetic field, and in navigation systems, among other applications. Steps to explain what a magnetometer sensor is: - Define magnetometer: A magnetometer is a device that measures the strength and direction of a magnetic field. - Describe its functioning: Magnetometer sensors work based on the principle that a magnetic field can induce a current in a conductive material. - Mention the common types: There are various types of magnetometers, such as fluxgate, Hall-effect, and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers. - List some applications: Magnetometer sensors are used in various applications, including geophysical surveys, archeology, mineral exploration, and navigation systems. 2. How do proximity sensors and G-sensors differ? Proximity sensors and G-sensors are different types of sensors, serving different purposes and function based on different principles. Steps to differentiate proximity sensors and G-sensors: - Define proximity sensor: A proximity sensor is a device that detects the presence of nearby objects without physical contact, using infrared, ultrasonic, or electromagnetic technology. - Define G-sensor: A G-sensor, also known as an accelerometer, is a device that measures changes in acceleration or gravitational forces acting upon it. - Explain differences in technology: Proximity sensors detect the presence of objects, while G-sensors measure changes in motion or acceleration. - Mention typical applications: Proximity sensors are used for object detection, collision avoidance, or vicinity sensing in robotics or automation systems. G-sensors are used in smartphones, automotive sensors, and gaming controllers to detect movement or screen orientation. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? No, the questions do not have the same meaning. They ask about different types of sensors (magnetometer, proximity, and G-sensors) and their differences. The first question asks about what a magnetometer sensor is, while the second question seeks clarification on the differences between proximity sensors and G-sensors, which are two other types of sensors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"You see those who have learned to channed their anger, just get more and more focused.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the sentence \\"You see those who have learned to channel their anger, just get more and more focused.\\" can be translated as: \\"Vidíš ty, kteří se naučili svůj hněv směrovat, stávají se čím dál tím více soustředění.\\" Here is a breakdown of the translation: - Vidíš (You see) - This is the direct translation of the English word \\"you see\\" and is a second person singular form of the verb \\"to see\\", which in Czech is \\"vidět\\". - ty (those) - This word is used to specify the group of people being referred to in the sentence. In this case, it's the people who have learned to channel their anger. - kteří (who) - This is a relative pronoun used to further specify and describe the group of people mentioned previously. - se naučili (have learned) - This is the past participle form of the verb \\"naučit se\\" (to learn) and together with the reflexive pronoun \\"se\\" means \\"have learned.\\" - svůj hněv (their anger) - \\"Svůj\\" is a possessive pronoun, used in this context to indicate possession of the following noun, \\"hněv\\" (anger). Together, they convey the meaning of \\"their anger.\\" - směrovat (to channel) - This is the infinitive form of the verb \\"směrovat\\", meaning \\"to channel\\" or \\"to direct.\\" In this sentence, it is used to describe the action of controlling and directing one's anger. - stávají se (become/get) - This is the present tense form of the verb \\"stávat se\\" (to become), used to describe the process of becoming increasingly focused. - čím dál tím více (more and more) - This is a Czech idiom that directly translates to \\"the more, the more\\" and is used to emphasize the increasing intensity or extent of something, in this case, focus. - soustředění (focused) - This is the adjective form of the word \\"soustředit\\" (to focus) and used here to describe the state of being focused. So, the translated sentence \\"Vidíš ty, kteří se naučili svůj hněv směrovat, stávají se čím dál tím více soustředění.\\" conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence, emphasizing the ability to channel one's anger and how it leads to an increasing state of focus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: Though he describes himself as being to the right of Attila the Hun on crime, he authorized the Willie Hortenesque early parole of more than 700 sex offenders in 1992. Hypothesis: In contrast to his stance of being hard on crime, he authorized the early parole of more than 700 sex offenders in 1992. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. However, to provide a detailed and long answer, let us first analyze the key components of both the premise and the hypothesis. Premise components: 1. The individual describes himself as being \\"to the right of Attila the Hun on crime.\\" This statement indicates that the person sees themselves as having a very strong, hardline stance on crime and punishment. Attila the Hun is often used as a symbol of barbarism and ruthlessness, so the individual is essentially saying that they are extremely tough on criminals. 2. Despite the proclaimed stance on crime, in 1992, this individual authorized the early parole of more than 700 sex offenders in an action that can be likened to the \\"Willie Horton-esque\\" scenario. The reference to Willie Horton is significant because it was a notorious case in the United States where a convicted murderer, William Horton, was granted a weekend furlough and then committed rape and assault during that time. The Willie Horton case was famously used in political campaigns to criticize policies considered soft on crime. Hypothesis components: 1. This individual's actions contrast with his claimed stance on being hard on crime. 2. The authorization of early parole for more than 700 sex offenders in 1992 is the action that demonstrates this contrast. Connecting the premise to the hypothesis: The premise entails the hypothesis because it explicitly explains the contradiction between the individual's self-description of being tough on crime and the actual actions taken by him, by granting early parole to sex offenders. The reference to the \\"Willie Horton-esque\\" scenario further emphasizes the contradiction, as it highlights the potential risk and public backlash associated with such a decision. In conclusion, the premise entails the hypothesis as it demonstrates the contrast between the person's self-proclaimed hardline stance on crime and the actions that were taken in 1992, which involved a more lenient approach in the case of 700 sex offenders.

You are given a new situation: Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B. and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Please answer this question : Would zone B see less or more organisms than zone A? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's go through the steps and information provided: 1. Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. 2. He has identified two zones: Zone A (a lake near agricultural lands declared as a dead zone) and Zone B (a lake near a national park that is not a dead zone). 3. Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it away into bodies of water. 4. The fertilizer contains nitrogen, which promotes excessive algae growth. 5. When algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue, using up all the oxygen in the water. 6. The lack of oxygen creates a dead zone where nothing grows. Following this information, Zone B, being near a national park and not a dead zone, would likely have less agricultural runoff and thus less nitrogen pollution in the water. It can be inferred that there would be a more balanced ecosystem in Zone B, with less excessive algae growth, more available oxygen, and overall better water quality. Based on these factors, Zone B would see more organisms than Zone A, as it is not a dead zone and provides a more suitable environment for aquatic life to thrive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You didn't even open the book the night before and you hear a voice in your head saying \\"Cheat, cheat ...\\" So what are you going to do, ignore it and fail or go for it? It's a tough decision many students must make. Most young people believe that cheating is wrong. However, they have cheated at least once in their high school years. So, why do they do it? Are they too lazy to study? Perhaps, it's not as simple as that. According to some experts, one main reason why students cheat is that they see their friends get away with it. It's an easy way out. They avoid embarrassment and their parents' anger for not doing well in an exam. Another reason is that students think it's OK to cheat if the subject isn't important for their future career. What's more, most students have to put up with the pressure of getting into university. They need to get good marks to carry on with their studies. This means that there will always be students who will do anything for a better mark. It has never been easier to cheat than it is today. With all the technology available, students needn't cheat by looking over their shoulders anymore. They use mobile phones to send answers to each other during a test. There is also the Internet. With hundreds of websites, students don't have to worry because they can find lots of material which they can copy and use in projects. There are even tips on the art of cheating in exams. Obviously, if you get caught cheating, you fail the exam or the subject. But it doesn't really matter whether you get caught or not. What's important is that it's wrong. You mustn't cheat because cheating is a lie. It deceives people into thinking you know more than you actually do. How can you be proud of something you have achieved through cheating? In the end, it's not about deceiving your teachers and your parents, but about fooling yourself that you can do something you really can't.

Dale flees to Saul's apartment and learns that Ted is a dangerous drug lord and could trace the roach back to Saul. Dale and Saul flee into the nearby woods while Ted's henchmen persuade Red to arrange a meeting with Saul. They accidentally fall asleep in Dale's car and wake up to find that they missed their meeting with Red.

Given the following context: William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as... answer the following question: What is the last name of the English artist whose portraits of male nudes were generally well received?

Woo island was frequently shaken by earthquakes, but Mud island had no such problems. Which island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters? Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the given information, Mud island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters. This is because Woo island is frequently shaken by earthquakes, which cause the rocks to move. Meanwhile, Mud island has no such problems and therefore experiences less movement of rocks. Since earthquakes mainly occur at plate boundaries and involve rocks moving several centimeters or more, it can be inferred that Mud island is less affected by the tectonic activity responsible for earthquakes, resulting in fewer rocks moving several centimeters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two friends who served together during the Second World War have been reunited 70 years later after a chance encounter revealed they were living just 12 miles from each other. Bessie Thomas and Millie Titshall were radar operators for the WAAF when they were both teenagers, and became close friends serving at a station in Inverness. However, they lost touch towards the end of the war - and although they tried to contact each other during the following decades, they never managed to get in touch. But when Mrs Thomas, 89, from Consett in. County Durham, was reading her local newspaper she noticed an appeal. for information about a former RAF base in Norfolk. Together again: Bessie Thomas, left, and Miggie Titshall, right, have been reunited after 70 years. Friends: The pair - then known as Bessie Shackley, left, and Mildred Greener, right - pictured during the war. Although she did not know that base, she made contact with the enthusiast who placed the advert on the off-chance that some of her former colleagues might have served there. She was particularly keen to find her old friend Mildred Greener - but when she was given a phone number for Millie Titshall, who she was told lived near her, she had no idea they were the same person. Mrs Thomas called the number and asked, 'Do you know of a Mildred Greener?' - only to be told, 'That's me!' The day of the pair's first conversation happened to be Mrs Titshall's 90th birthday, and came 70 years after they had last seen each other. The two women, then aged just 17 and 18, first met at RAF Snaith in Yorkshire after volunteering for the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. Coincidence: The woman realised that they lived just 12 miles apart in Co Durham thanks to a newspaper ad. They were transferred together to radar operations in Inverness, but lost contact when they moved to different parts of the country. The younger woman, then known as Bessie Shackley, met her future husband Larry Thomas while they were both being de-mobbed at the end of the war. Mildred Greener also changed her surname when she married, and started calling herself Millie because other relatives shared her first name. Mrs Thomas was so keen to trace her friend that she once called every number listed under 'Greener' in her local phonebook. When the pair - now both widowed - finally made contact again, Mrs Thomas was so excited she immediately travelled to Mrs Tindall's Chester-le-Street home via bus and taxi. Memories: The pair have enjoyed reminiscing about their wartime experiences with the WAAF. Her first sight of her old friend was of her waiting on the street outside her house. 'I think I could have walked past her on the street, but she's still lovely and thin,' Mrs Thomas said. Once the pair started talking about their time in the WAAF, they could not stop reminding each other of all their unusual experiences. Both vividly remembered typing out messages on rice paper, which would be given to pilots so they could recognise beacon signals and then eat their instructions if they were captured. Mrs Thomas said: 'Millie told me, \\"I used to eat it!\\" as we didn't get sweets very much - they were rationed - and I said, \\"That's what I used to do!\\"' Hard at work: A group of other WAAF workers pictured during the war working at a radar station. They also recalled circling the perimeter of the airfield, attaching metallic strips to planes in order to interfere with enemy radar. 'Mildred would get taken around in a van as she was smaller than me and couldn't reach up - and I had to cycle,' Mrs Thomas said. Her daughter Marilyn, who was present during a second meeting between the pair, said they were soon laughing so much that they appeared to be shaking in photographs. The two old friends now intend to keep in regular contact - and Mrs Thomas is keen to get in touch with other former colleagues too.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Frederic Leighton used as a model? from the following article ? Hope is traditionally considered by Christians as a theological virtue (a virtue associated with the grace of God, rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless. In late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that...

Context: In January 2011, Rajinikanth was slated to appear in Rana, a period film to be produced by Soundarya Rajinikanth and directed by K. S. Ravikumar, who would work with the actor for a third time. During the principal photography of the film on 29 April 2011, he suffered a mild foodborne illness on the sets, which led to vomiting, dehydration, and exhaustion. He was treated at St. Isabel's Hospital for a day before being discharged. Five days later, he was rushed to the same hospital again after suffering from breathlessness and fever. He was diagnosed with bronchitis and was kept at the hospital for a week, while also spending a few days in an intensive care unit. Several conflicting reports of discharge dates arose, as well as claims of Rajinikanth's health deteriorating. Two days after his last discharge, Rajinikanth was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute on 16 May 2011 for recurring respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. The hospital maintained that Rajinikanth was in stable condition and showed positive response to treatment. It was widely reported that he required a kidney transplantation, which was later denied by Dhanush. On 21 May 2011, Aishwarya Rajinikanth released a photo of her and Rajinikanth in his hospital ward, both posing with a thumbs signal, responding to fans' negative reaction to news reports. The hospital restricted unauthorised visitors. Rajinikanth's brother, Sathyanarayana Rao Gaekwad, reported that the cause of the sudden illness was due to stress from rapid weight-loss and changes in diet, as well as withdrawal of alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. After addressing fans in a 4-minute digitally recorded voice message to the media, Rajinikanth, under the advice of Amitabh Bachchan, travelled from Chennai to Singapore with his family on 21 May 2011, where he was to undergo further treatment for nephropathy at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. After spending over two weeks at the hospital, he was finally discharged on 15 June 2011 and continued to recuperate in Singapore, before returning to Chennai on 13 July 2011. Despite several failed attempts to restart Rana upon his return, Rajinikanth reprised his Enthiran character, Chitti, in the Bollywood science-fiction film Ra.One (2011) in a guest appearance alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor. In November 2011, it was decided that Rana would be shelved in favour of a new project with Rajinikanth, titled Kochadaiiyaan. The motion capture film, which is the first of its kind in India, was released in 2014 to positive reviews. Kochadaiiyaan, and the 3D release of Sivaji in 2012, made Rajinikanth the first Indian actor to have appeared in four different forms of world cinema: black-and-white, colour, 3D and motion capture. Following the completion of Kochadaiiyaan, Rajinikanth began work in Ravikumar's next directorial venture, titled Lingaa alongside Anushka Shetty and Sonakshi Sinha. The film was released on 12 December 2014, coinciding with his birthday, and received mixed reviews from critics. Rajinikanth's next film was director Pa. Ranjith's crime drama Kabali, produced by S. Thanu. The film was released in July 2016. Rajinikanth is filming for 2.0, a spiritual successor to Enthiran, that is scheduled for release in 2017. In August 2016, it was announced that he would work with Ranjith again for a new film produced by Dhanush. Rajinikanth has often been referred to as the most popular film actor in South India by the media and audiences. In 2015, a film about his fandom, For the Love of a Man, premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. His popularity has been attributed to \\"his uniquely styled dialogues and idiosyncrasies in films, as well as his political statements and philanthropy\\". Many also cite reasons for Rajinikanth's popularity as coming from his larger-than-life super-hero appearance in many films, supported by gravity-defying stunts and charismatic expressions, all while attempting to maintain modesty in real-life. Almost every film of Rajinikanth has punchlines delivered by him in an inimitable style, and these punchlines often have a message or even warn the film's antagonists. These dialogues are usually fabricated to create new ones or even be taken in a comical way, but do not fail to create a sense of entertainment among viewers. It is suggested by the media that actresses such as Gouthami and Nayanthara got their initial breakthrough after co-starring with Rajinikanth very early in their careers, giving other aspiring actors the urge to work with him. Rajinikanth is also the only Indian actor to be featured in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus, in a lesson titled From Bus Conductor to Superstar. After opening his first official Twitter account in 2014, Rajinikanth received over 210,000 followers within 24 hours, which according to The Economic Times was deemed by social media research firms as the fastest rate of followers for any Indian celebrity, as well as among the top-10 in the world. Much like Chuck Norris facts, \\"Rajinikanth facts\\" or \\"Rajinikanth jokes\\" are widely circulated in text messages and memes over the Internet. These satirical jokes have also inspired several mobile applications for iOS and Android. Critics, such as Cho Ramaswamy, have commented that Rajinikanth has the potential to be successful in Indian politics due to his popularity and fan base alone. In 1995, Rajinikanth began supporting the Indian National Congress after meeting Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. An opinion poll conducted by the magazine Kumudam predicted that Congress, with Rajinikanth's support, might win up to 130 seats in the Tamil Nadu Assembly. In 1996, when the Congress Party decided to align with All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) for the assembly election in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth changed loyalties and supported the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) alliance. The TMC used a bicycle as their election symbol and used an image of Rajinikanth riding a bicycle from the film Annamalai in their posters. Rajinikanth said: \\"Even God cannot save Tamil Nadu if AIADMK returns to power.\\" Rajinikanth wholeheartedly supported the DMK and TMC alliance and asked the people of Tamil Nadu and his fans to vote for that alliance. This alliance had a complete victory in 1996. Rajinikanth also supported the DMK-TMC alliance in the parliamentary election, held the same year. Later in 2004, Rajinikanth said he would personally vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but would not extend his support to any front during the upcoming Indian general election. The party, however, failed to win any seats in Tamil Nadu in the Lok Sabha. Fans of Rajinikanth in Tamil Nadu have continuously speculated on his entry in politics, particularly to run for Chief Minister of the state. In 2008, a few fans in Coimbatore launched a political party for Rajinikanth, in an attempt to pressure his entry. The party was named the Desiya Dravadar Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, with a dedicated party flag and symbol. After learning about this, Rajinikanth submitted an open letter to the media, declaring that he had no connection with these events and requested fans not to indulge in such activities, warning that he would take legal action if they failed to adhere. He also mentioned that he was not interested in politics, and thus was only committed to working in films. He added that nobody can force him to enter politics, just as no one can stop him from entering it. Rajinikanth announced entry into politics on 31 Dec 2017 and confirmed that his newly formed party will contest in assembly elections in 2021 from all 234 constituencies in Tamil Nadu state. His party, he said, would resign if it was unable to fullfill its electoral promises within three years of coming into power. Question: In what ways did he support the prime minister?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Rajinikanth supported the Prime Minister in a few ways. In 1995, he started supporting the Indian National Congress after meeting Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. He showed his support for the Congress Party during the Tamil Nadu State Assembly elections. But later, in 1996, when Congress decided to align with AIADMK for the Tamil Nadu State Assembly elections, he changed his loyalties and supported the DMK-TMC alliance instead. In 2004, he said he would personally vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the upcoming general election. So, Rajinikanth supported different parties and Prime Ministers by voting for them and showing his loyalty during various elections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Generate a short movie review that has \\"negative\\" sentiment (Options: +negative. +positive.).","completion":"Title: A Fading Dream Movie Review: A Fading Dream, directed by a once-promising filmmaker Richard Revel, failed to deliver on its numerous promises, leaving viewers with a bitter taste and a negative sentiment about the wasted potential. This film is an unfortunate example of what happens when a great idea is poorly executed. The movie's premise of intertwining dreams and reality held so much potential, but it was squandered as the plot grew increasingly convoluted with little coherence or direction, making it difficult for the audience to stay engaged or develop any real investment in the characters. The many twists and turns in this poorly written script only succeeded in inducing confusion and frustration, instead of the awe and revelation they were apparently intended to evoke. In A Fading Dream, the performance of the lead actors, Alice Hambridge and Steven Quart, was lackluster at best and wooden at worst. Their obvious lack of chemistry made their supposed love story feel contrived and forced, resulting in cringe-worthy moments instead of sparks of romantic passion. The supporting cast failed to shine, with characters bordering on stereotypes and their development remaining largely stagnant throughout the film. There was an overt absence of any real emotional connection or empathy evoked in the audience for any of the characters. The cinematography and special effects also left much to be desired. While the concept of transitioning from dream sequences to reality could have provided visually stunning and imaginative sequences, the film disappointingly presented amateurish and unpolished scenes that were disorienting and ultimately detracted from the overall aesthetic. It seemed as though creative risks were either avoided completely or executed without a clear vision, resulting in a dull and uninspired movie experience. Moreover, the musical score by Samuel Stevens was forgettable and frequently felt discordant with the scenes it accompanied, drawing attention away from the on-screen action and further disconnecting the audience from the already disjointed narrative. The music could have played a significant role in amplifying the film's emotional resonance, but it ultimately fell short in achieving any meaningful impact. In conclusion, A Fading Dream is a film that fails to live up to its potential and leaves the audience with an overwhelming sense of disappointment. Its few redeeming qualities are overshadowed by the convoluted plot, subpar acting, drab visual scenes and forgettable score. A once-exciting concept is rendered lackluster and unfulfilling by its execution, leaving viewers with a negative sentiment as they watch a dream fade away into the abyss of missed opportunities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries. and the situation: John was studying the species in Siberia. He found that the Siberian tiger is an apex predator. It had a pretty stable population during the sixteenth century. He noted that information as case A. Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B. Answer the following question: In case B, would the number of mesopredators be less or more than in case A? A:","completion":"In case B, the number of mesopredators would likely be more than in case A. The reduction in the population of Siberian tigers, which are apex predators, due to the introduction of guns in the seventeenth century would lead to a phenomenon called mesopredator release. Mesopredator release occurs when the removal or decrease in top-level predators results in an increase in the population of mesopredators, which are smaller predators that are normally kept in check by the apex predators. In this situation, with fewer Siberian tigers to control their populations, mesopredators would likely experience a surge in their numbers as there is less predation pressure on them. This can lead to shifts in the ecosystem balance and potentially cause disruptions in trophic cascades."},{"prompt":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham.

Here is a question about this article: It is thought that annelids were originally animals with two separate sexes, which released ova and sperm into the water via their nephridia. The fertilized eggs develop into trochophore larvae, which live as plankton. Later they sink to the sea-floor and metamorphose into miniature adults: the part of the trochophore between the apical tuft and the prototroch becomes the prostomium (head); a small area round the trochophore's anus becomes the pygidium (tail-piece); a narrow band immediately in front of that becomes the growth zone that produces new segments; and the rest of the trochophore becomes the peristomium (the segment that contains the mouth). What is the answer to this question: What do annelid eggs become?","completion":"Okay little buddy! Annelid eggs are special because they grow up into something called trochophore larvae. Imagine them like little sea creatures floating around in the water. Later, they change again and turn into tiny grown-up annelids that live on the sea-floor. So, the answer is: Annelid eggs become trochophore larvae!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The narrator sat the person on the potty, which suggests that the person may be young or needs assistance with using the bathroom. Now let's evaluate the available choices: I. The narrator's best friend - This option is less likely as best friends usually wouldn't have such close involvement in each other's bathroom habits, and they typically wouldn't need assistance with using the bathroom. II. The narrator's infant son - This option is more likely because an infant would naturally have issues with bladder control and would require help using the potty. III.

She was crowned the Miss Sri Lanka Universe 2006, and represented her country at Miss Universe 2006. Context: Fernandez shares a close bond with her family, and admits that she misses being around them. She says: \\"I miss them so much everyday. You don't realise when you live away from home how difficult life can be [...] At the same time, staying away from them has taught me to be more responsible. It has taught me so many things about myself, about priorities and time management.\\" In March 2012, Fernandez turned vegetarian for a 40-day period to observe Lent, a period from Ash Wednesday to Holy Saturday. In 2008, Fernandez started dating Bahraini prince Hassan bin Rashid Al Khalifa, whom she met at a mutual friend's party; they separated in 2011.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which reaction will proceed slower? Alexander is conducting reactions in his college chemistry class. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses a high strength burner so the temperature of the reaction is high. In the second reaction, reaction B, he uses a weaker model of burner, so the temperature of the reaction is low. Hint: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. A:","completion":"To determine which reaction will proceed slower, we need to consider the effect of temperature on the rate of chemical reactions. Higher temperature usually leads to faster reaction rates due to increased kinetic energy of the particles involved in the reaction.

Given the two facts above, what causes growth? Choose your answer from: (I). Cancer. (II). bushes (III). Roundworms (IV). bamboo (V). hormones (VI). Earthworms (VII). collagen (VIII). Proteins The answer is:","completion":"(V). hormones and (VIII). Proteins Growth is a complex process that involves various factors, including hormonal and protein regulation. While it is not accurate to attribute growth to just one or two causes, hormones and proteins are two major factors involved in stimulating and controlling growth. Hormones, such as growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor, are released into the bloodstream by the endocrine system and influence cells to divide, grow, and differentiate. They play critical roles in regulating development, metabolism, and overall body size. For example, growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates the liver and other tissues to release insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), which in turn promotes cell division and organ growth throughout the body. Proteins also have essential roles in facilitating growth, as they are the primary building blocks of all cells. Proteins are involved in cell division, cell repair, and even replication of genetic material. During the growth process, proteins ensure proper communication, structure, and functionality within cells. In particular, the synthesis of collagen, actin, and myosin is necessary for the growth and maintenance of muscles, bones, and connective tissues. The family of proteins called growth factors is another important component of the growth process, as they act as signaling molecules that influence the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells. Aside from the main contributors mentioned above, other factors, such as genetic makeup, nutrition, and environmental factors, also play essential roles in growth. Although cancer (Fact 2) is a result of uncontrolled cell division, it is not the sole cause of growth in organisms. Similarly, including factors such as bushes (II), roundworms (III), bamboo (IV), and earthworms (VI) is irrelevant, as they are examples of organisms or plants that undergo growth, rather than what causes growth in living entities. Lastly, collagen (VII) is a protein that plays a role in providing structure and strength for connective tissues, making it a component of the proteins that contribute to growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They also visited the Vatican, the Pantheon and walked around the city’s famous Roman ruins. Part two: Rebecca flew to Disney World Florida in Orlando to enjoy the second week of her honeymoon. Never scared of making a splash, Rebecca laughed and smiled her way down the resort's log flume ride. Next stop – via a Virgin Atlantic flight – was Disney World Resort in Florida, Orlando, where they were joined by fellow swimmer Michael Gunning. Rebecca tweeted, 'Hello Orlando!! So excited to be spending the week here! Great flight with now off to hotel-theme park tomorrow!!' on their arrival. The trio rode on the famous long flume-style ride called Splash Mountain and visited Disney's Animal Kingdom. On one picture she put on Instagram of the ride Rebecca commented, ‘Sums up our trip…. @harryneeds loving life - @michaelgunning1 scared and me laughing/smiling the whole way through!!! #splashmountain #disney’. It's behind you! Mr and Mrs Needs walked around sights including Altare della Patria during their Rome trip. The 25-year-old ex-Olympic champion then posted a picture of her and Harry standing in front of the famous Cinderella Castle with the caption ‘where dreams come true’. She also found a pair of bridal style Minnie Mouse ears with a veil and posed for a shot in one of the gift shops. 'Couldn't help myself today,' she wrote. 'Was a Disney bride!' Lastly, Harry and Rebecca visited Universal Studios, another theme park in Orlando which has – as well as all sorts of rides and attractions – a ‘romantic’ restaurant and pool. The ex Olympic gold medallist looked relaxed while standing in front of ancient Roman ruins in Rome. The time of their life? The couple packed in many different sightseeing locations as well as two continents. The couple could well have visited The Wizarding World of Harry Potter while here. Keen to keep her followers abreast of their movements Rebecca put up a picture of the couple standing happily outside of the Universal sign. She wrote underneath, ‘Such an amazing day at Universal!!!!!!’ 'Couldn't help myself today.... Was a Disney bride!' Rebecca wrote after trying on bunny ears in Disney World.

A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: \\"The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.\\" He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, both questions 1 and 2 are asking about the same issue, which is the problems or conflicts in Baluchistan. To provide a detailed and long answer: Baluchistan, a region divided between Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, has experienced numerous problems and conflicts throughout its history. The problems can be broadly categorized into political, economic, social, and security issues, which have led to the Baluchistan conflict. 1. Political issues: The Baloch people, who are an ethnic minority in these three countries, have struggled for greater autonomy and even independence in some cases. They have not been able to effectively participate in the political process, leading to a sense of alienation from their respective governments. In both Iran and Pakistan, Baloch nationalists argue that their region has been politically marginalized and their culture oppressed, which has fueled a feeling of separation. 2. Economic issues: Despite being rich in natural resources like minerals, gas, and fisheries, the region remains economically underdeveloped. Many Baloch people feel that their resources are exploited by the central governments, with little benefit to the local population. This has led to widespread resentment and social unrest, driving people to support separatist movements. 3. Social issues: Baluchistan faces various social problems like poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, and lack of infrastructure. There is insufficient access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. Moreover, the Baloch people's distinct culture and language face erosion, as the younger generation loses the sense of their unique identity, leading to frustration and anger among the youth. 4. Security issues: The region has become a hotspot for various militant groups, both nationalist-separatist groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and religious extremist groups like the Taliban. The instability created by these groups has led to a precarious security situation, with violence and kidnappings becoming increasingly common. The Baluchistan conflict primarily centers around the struggle for greater political autonomy, fair distribution of economic resources, cultural preservation, and security. It has manifested in various forms, including insurgency, civil unrest, and diplomatic tensions. Baloch nationalists argue that their region has been politically marginalized and economically exploited by the central governments, leading to social unrest, economic disparity, and the emergence of violent separatist movements. The governments in Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have responded to these demands with varying degrees of force and repression, further complicating the conflict and deepening suspicion between the parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson (Anthony Mackie), and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired.

Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam (Rufus Sewell), a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma (Erin Wasson).

Though Sturgess warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary. Lincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam.

Allan David Bloom (September 14, 1930 - October 7, 1992) was an American philosopher, classicist, and academician. He studied under David Grene, Leo Strauss, Richard McKeon, and Alexandre Kojeve. He subsequently taught at Cornell University, the University of Toronto, Yale University, Ecole Normale Superieure of Paris, and the University of Chicago. Bloom championed the idea of Great Books education and became famous for his criticism of contemporary American higher education, with his views being expressed in his bestselling 1987 book, The Closing of the American Mind. Allan Bloom was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1930 to second-generation Jewish parents who were both social workers. The couple had a daughter, Lucille, two years earlier. As a thirteen-year-old, Bloom read a Readers Digest article about the University of Chicago and told his parents he wanted to attend; his parents thought it was unreasonable and did not encourage his hopes. Yet, when his family moved to Chicago in 1944, his parents met a psychiatrist and family friend whose son was enrolled in the University of Chicago's humanities program for gifted students. In 1946, Bloom was accepted to the same program, starting his degree at the age of fifteen, and spending the next decade of his life enrolled at the University in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood. This began his lifelong passion for the 'idea' of the university. In the preface to Giants and Dwarfs: Essays, 1960-1990, he stated that his education \\"began with Freud and ended with Plato\\". The theme of this education was self-knowledge, or self-discovery--an idea that Bloom would later write, seemed impossible to conceive of for a Midwestern American boy. He credits Leo Strauss as the teacher who made this endeavor possible for him. Bloom graduated from the University of Chicago with his Bachelor's Degree at the age of 18. One of his college classmates was the classicist Seth Benardete. For post-graduate studies, he enrolled in the University of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought, where he was assigned Classicist David Grene as tutor, and went on to write his thesis on Isocrates. Grene recalled Bloom as an energetic and humorous student completely dedicated to studying classics, but with no definite career ambitions. The Committee was a unique interdisciplinary program that attracted a small number of students due to its rigorous academic requirements and lack of clear employment opportunities after graduation. Bloom earned his Ph.D. from the Committee on Social Thought in 1955. He subsequently studied under the influential Hegelian philosopher Alexandre Kojeve in Paris, whose lectures Bloom would later introduce to the English-speaking world. While teaching philosophy at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, he befriended Raymond Aron, amongst many other philosophers. Among the American expatriate community in Paris his friends included leftist writer Susan Sontag.

Write a text based on this summary: bowls golds shared four ways Text:","completion":"In a small, serene village nestled in the heart of the countryside, the verdant landscape stretched as far as the eye could see. Trees bearing fruits of various colors, a river meandering gracefully through lush fields, and the sun perpetually reflecting its golden hues upon the surrounding land, it seemed that everything in this charming village was thriving harmoniously. Yet, it was not just the land that was reaping the benefits of this golden delight, but the very residents of the quaint village themselves. It all started one fateful day, years ago when the elders of the village discovered a secret that would forever change their lives and their community. The four wisest women of the village unexpectedly stumbled upon four golden bowls, each nestled deep within a mysterious cave, hidden in the forest's shadows. Curiosity piqued, they carefully examined each of the bowls and realized they were no ordinary vessels. They seemed to radiate with a nearly otherwordly energy, as if they were brimming with an unfathomable amount of fortune. The four village elders knew, even before uttering a single word to one another, that these bowls possessed the power to bless their beloved village with unparalleled prosperity for generations to come. Determined to keep their discovery a secret and use it exclusively for the good of the people, the village elders devised a plan that would best utilize the power of these golden bowls. Reaching a unanimous decision, they agreed upon dividing the bounties of the bowls among the four primary aspects of the village that needed their support the most: agriculture, education, healthcare, and infrastructure. And so, the prosperous era of the village began. Agriculture flourished as the fields sprung forth with a never-ending abundance of crops; the hungry hailed their good fortune, while the farmers nestled in their cozy homes without a financial worry in sight. Education received an unprecedented boost, with the children busily engaged in their studies and the most competent tutors to guide them. The sounds of laughter and learning transmitted through the corridors of the village's newly constructed school, which now habored the brightest minds who sought to bring about further progress. With their healthcare system revitalized, the villagers' well-being became the topmost priority. Any ailment or disease that dared to sneak into the community was treated swiftly, allowing the residents to live robustly and with few complaints about their physical condition. Finally, the care and attention given to the infrastructure of the village were unparalleled, as the roads, bridges, and buildings were all crafted meticulously and diligently maintained. Times of hardship became a mere memory for the village, as the gleaming gold from the bowls showered blessings of prosperity and growth throughout every corner of the community. The village elders would ensure that each of the four golden bowls would continue to be a shared force in sustaining their village's prosperity, handing down their secret only to the next wisest and most honorable individuals who would follow in their footsteps. With each new generation, the legacy of the bowls continued to weave a tapestry of good fortune, as the village not only thrived but also stood testament to the incredible power of unity, kindness, and selflessness. The golden bowls, shared four ways, not only illuminated the village but bestowed upon it a magical, perpetual infusion of wealth and growth. As the sun continued to warm the earth and cast its golden rays upon the land, the villagers smiled in grateful acknowledgment of their found treasure. More than the gleaming gold of the bowls, the shining spirits of the people connected hearts in friendship and cooperation, securing success, and happiness for generations to come. And so, once a simple village in the heart of the countryside transformed into a thriving haven, eternally blessed by the shared prosperity of four extraordinary golden bowls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He feels a mix of nostalgia and unease, as the hollow silence urges him to look deeper into the reason behind the reunion. As he explores the school, he encounters various clues and cryptic notes left by his former students. Each note shares a memory from their time with Holland, revealing the profound impact he had on their lives. As Holland pieces together the story, he finds out that his former students have all grown up to lead successful and fulfilled lives, each in their own way. From entrepreneurs and scientists to philanthropists and artists, they all attribute their achievements to the lessons and guidance they received from Holland during their formative years. Interlaced within these notes, Holland starts to uncover a sinister plot brews among a few of his students. As he digs deeper, he realizes that their goal is to take revenge on another former student, Daniel, who terrorized and bullied them in high school.

Here is an article: A jury will get final instructions from a judge on Friday and begin deliberations after hearing closing arguments in the case of man accused of sexually assaulting a boy in a remote Nova Scotia cabin. John Leonard MacKean, 64, is on trial in Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Bridgewater. He has pleaded not guilty to sexual assault and communicating for the purpose of obtaining sexual services from a person under 18. The charges stem from a 2012 incident in which a boy, 16, escaped from a cabin in the woods in Lunenburg County after being held captive by Wayne Cunningham and David James Leblanc. MacKean testified in his own defence on Thursday, saying he thought the boy was 21 and saw no indication he was there against his will. In closing arguments, Crown prosecutor Lloyd Tancock called MacKean’s version of events \\"absolutely preposterous.\\" He said everyone else believed the boy to be no older than 16. \\"(MacKean) didn't care,\\" Tancock said. \\"He was getting what he wanted.\\" MacKean’s defence lawyer, Mike Taylor, told jurors there were inconsistencies in the boy’s testimony, that he’s lied under oath before and been in trouble with the law. During his testimony Thursday, MacKean repeated some facts already presented to the jury. MacKean said he met Cunningham through Alcoholics Anonymous. They met several times to discuss AA but then MacKean said Cunningham — whom he knew as “Patrick” — offered to give massages to help him with pain associated with his sciatic nerve. He testified the massages eventually became sexual in nature, resulting in what MacKean called “happy endings.” MacKean said he knew there would be another man at the cabin but that he was expecting a two-man massage when Cunningham made the invitation. He said instead, he found a naked, blindfolded male, who he thought was a 20-something-year-old friend of Cunningham. The boy in the cabin was 16 at the time. MacKean insisted in court he saw no chains and no indication the boy was there against his will. He said if he had, he would have got the boy out of there himself. He said Cunningham initiated sexual contact by massaging both him and the boy on the bed at the same time. Cunningham invited him to touch the boy with his hand, which he said he did briefly. MacKean said Cunningham then massaged him until he ejaculated, then he left. He said he was only in the cabin for 12 to 15 minutes. That's less time than he told police he was in the cabin. When asked what the demeanour of the boy on the bed was, he said he seemed OK. \\"I wouldn't say jovial,\\" he said, but the person didn't cry or ask that the activity stop. MacKean maintained he never paid for sexual services, other than the massages, and never from someone who was underage. He admitted that he was frightened when he was arrested. \\"Scared doesn't even begin to cover it.\\" MacKean added: \\"Obviously the mistake I made was in judging [Cunningham's] character.\\" Mike Taylor, MacKean’s lawyer, urged jurors not to judge MacKean on his lifestyle choices or for things they might feel uncomfortable about. On Wednesday, the court watched a four-hour police interview in which MacKean admitted he touched the boy, but denied knowing he was underage. The court heard that MacKean's DNA was found on the boy and on the bed to which he was chained. Prosecutor Lloyd Tancock said it was valuable evidence. The youth testified earlier this week that he had been abducted by two other men and kept in the cabin 130 kilometres southwest of Halifax. The 17-year-old — who was 16 at the time the offences are alleged to have taken place — also said he had been bound to a bed by chains and forced to wear a black sleeping mask when a third man was brought to the cabin on Sept. 20, 2012. He said he never saw the third man. Cunningham and Leblanc were the co-accused in the case. Cunningham was found dead in northern Ontario during a manhunt after the teen escaped. Police ruled out foul play in his death. Leblanc pleaded guilty to kidnapping, forcible confinement, sexual assault, uttering threats and breach of conditions and was sentenced in June to 11 years in prison. MacKean was charged after the teen told police he was kept at a house in Upper Chelsea, Lunenburg County, for eight days in September 2012 before he managed to escape. He said he walked more than a kilometre to a home, where he sought help.

The answer to the question: In what year did Carlo Maria Giulini start to share the conducting at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra? is inside the article: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America.

Answer choices: - Metling snow - Condensation - The sun - friction - Gravitational pull - mechanical - Weathering - Animals Answer:","completion":"Ice wedging is caused by the process of mechanical weathering. Here's how it works: Water seeps into cracks or fractures in rocks during warmer temperatures. When the temperature drops and it becomes cold enough, this water freezes and turns into ice. When water freezes, it expands. This expansion exerts pressure on the surrounding rock, causing it to break or \\"wedge\\" apart. This repetitive freeze-thaw cycle that occurs with the changing seasons is at the heart of the ice wedging process.

Context: President Donald Trump made a fresh appeal Friday for support to arm some teachers to help stem mass shootings targeting schools. Trump's pitch came during a speech before a friendly conservative crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) meeting near Washington. Trump spent much of the past week dealing with the aftermath of the tragic high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Although a new experience for Trump, it is a situation many of his predecessors are all too familiar with. Former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all faced similar tragedies while in office. They also dealt with political pressures in the aftermath demanding action. Trump is also beginning to see why presidents are often frustrated when they try to bridge what pollsters and political pundits often refer to as the great divide over guns in the United States. In the aftermath of the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, President Clinton sought to calm the nation. \\"We must do more to reach out to our children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts with words, not weapons,\\" he said. In 2007, it was left to President Bush to lead the grieving at Virginia Tech after a gunman killed 32 people before committing suicide. \\"May God bless and keep the souls of the lost, and may his love touch all of those who suffer in grief,\\" he said at an on campus memorial service. And in 2012, an emotional President Obama wiped away a tear as he addressed the nation in the wake of the massacre of grade-school students in Newtown, Connecticut. \\"We've endured too many of these tragedies in the last few years. The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10 years old,\\" he said.

I can use this background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] Now, I have a new situation: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot. Answer this question please: Which lake had more dissolved nutrients?","completion":"Based on the given information, Low Lake had more dissolved nutrients. High Lake experienced water stratification, in which fresh and saltwater layers prevented nutrient mixing between layers, thereby limiting primary production due to nutrient availability. With less primary production, there would be less dissolved nutrients in the water. In contrast, Low Lake did not have the issue of water stratification. As a result, nutrients could mix freely throughout the water column, leading to an abundant and prolific fishing spot. The lack of stratification and presence of nutrient-rich waters would promote primary production, which in turn supports a higher concentration of dissolved nutrients in Low Lake compared to High Lake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

During her time there, her father and her new family neglect her emotionally, driving her to throw a stone through their dining room window, and catch a bus back to Maryland.

After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\". Released in November 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can't Leave Behind, setting a personal best for the band. Overall, it sold 9 million copies globally.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Where does the weasel become frightened? The cartoon starts with the arm of an animator drawing a farm scene. The farm scene then colors itself, and the camera zooms in just as the plot follows: A realistic-looking horse is seen, whinnying (courtesy of Mel Blanc), and a comic triple plays out: The narrator asks the horse to do a trot; the horse obliges. The narrator asks for a gallop; the horse again obliges. The narrator then asks the horse to do a \\"canter\\". The horse turns from realistic to a cartoon horse, with the bugged eyes of, and singing \\"I'm Happy About the Whole Thing\\" (by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer) in the style of, the vaudeville star Eddie Cantor, vocally impersonated by Kent Rogers. The narrator admonishes the horse, which grins sheepishly. The family dog is seen lazing on the porch, springing to alertness when the newspaper arrives. The dog makes a mad dash to the end of the driveway, gets the paper, comes back to the porch, and immediately starts to read the paper himself, starting with the Sunday comics. He turns to the audience, and says, \\"I can hardly wait to see what happened to Dick Tracy!\\" (This gag would be used by Clampett again in The Great Piggy Bank Robbery.) A hen leaves her eggs unguarded, and a mean-looking weasel stealthily creeps into the henhouse while the narrator frets. Just as he is about to grab the eggs, they all hatch at once, and the chicks shout \\"BOO!\\" in unison. The frightened weasel evokes a Joe Penner catch-phrase, \\"Don't ever DOOO that!\\" and gasps as his heart pounds. An owl is hooting dully until it briefly smiles while saying \\"Who's Yehoodi?\\" A few birds put a little twig, a bit of string, and piece of straw until they make a house approved by the Federal Housing Administration, singing, \\"There's no place like home!\\" A worried field mouse with huge ears is asked about what worries him; he claims \\"I don't know, Doc.

This means volcanoes and earthquakes, which can cause serious loss of life. Many people there have heard suggestions of what to do in an earthquake. For instance, they are taught to stand in a doorway or, in a building, avoid the elevators and head for the stairs. Mr. Doug Copp is an expert on earthquakes and is the Rescue Chief and Disaster Manager of the American Rescue Team International. He has worked at every major disaster in the world since 1985. What his years of involvement have taught Doug is that when roofs and ceilings collapse they fall on objects and furniture, crushing them. Anyone hiding under a desk or a bed is always killed. However, Doug says the falling roofs and ceilings always end up forming triangle of space between the crushed object and the floor, what he refers to as Triangles Of Life. Instead of hiding under a solid object, lie on the floor next to it and you will likely have a space to survive. Doug says paper does not crush and usually where there are boxes of paper in an office building there will be a triangle space next to it. What about the old idea of standing in a doorway because the roof falls into the room? Dough says people who stand in doorways are usually killed, too. If the door falls forwards or backwards you will get crushed by the falling ceiling. If it falls sideways you will get cut in half by the doorway. What about stairs? Stairs have a different \\"moment of frequency \\" to the rest of the building and will swing back and forth until they collapse. Getting caught on a destroyed set of stairs means you will probably be injured or even killed by the different parts. Who has the highest probability to survive an earthquake?

Larsson was born in Helsingborg, Scania. His father, Francisco Rocha, is from Cape Verde, and his mother, Eva Larsson, is Swedish. His parents, who never married and split up when he was 12, decided that he should take his mother's surname because they felt it would make it easier for their son to be accepted in Sweden. He credits his father for his love of football. At the end of the 2003-04 season, Larsson left Celtic on a free transfer and signed a one-year contract with Barcelona with an option for a second year. Larsson's contribution in Barca's La Liga win in his first season there was disrupted by serious injury. He scored 3 goals in 12 Liga games and one goal (against his former club Celtic) in four Champions League matches. After the match against Celtic, he said: \\"It was very difficult for me to celebrate my goal because I had so many great times here.\\" On 20 November 2004, during the 3-0 victory in El Clasico against Real Madrid, Larsson tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus in his left knee. Despite his injury-hit 2004-05 season, playing only 16 games, Barcelona took the option to extend his contract. In December 2005, Larsson announced that at the end of his contract, which ended in July, he would leave Barcelona and return to Sweden to end his career. He revealed that he had refused an offer by club president Joan Laporta to extend his contract to the end of the next season. On the announcement of his departure, Ronaldinho said: In Larsson's final match for Barcelona, his substitute introduction was pivotal to win the 2006 Champions League final. Larsson assisted both of Barcelona's goals in a 2-1 win over Arsenal. Thierry Henry paid tribute to Larsson's contribution to Barcelona's win after the match, saying, \\"People always talk about Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o, Ludovic Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; you need to talk about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight.\\" Indeed, his ability to give Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by the international press.

Robert Gordon Orr, OC (born March 20, 1948) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, widely acknowledged as one of the greatest hockey players of all time. Orr used his ice skating speed, scoring, and play-making abilities to revolutionize the position of defenceman. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 12 seasons, starting with 10 with the Boston Bruins followed by two with the Chicago Black Hawks. Orr remains the only defenceman to have won the league scoring title with two Art Ross Trophies. Orr joined the Bruins for the 1966-67 season, his first as a professional. The Bruins were not convinced Orr belonged on defence, trying him out at centre first. Through the pre-season, Orr was given jersey number 27. At the season's start, the Bruins offered him jersey number 5, that of past Bruins star Dit Clapper, but Orr chose jersey number 4. Orr made his NHL regular-season debut on October 19, 1966, against the Detroit Red Wings, getting one assist. On October 22, he scored his first NHL goal against the Montreal Canadiens. It was a slap shot past Gump Worsley and the Boston Garden crowd gave Orr a standing ovation. In that first season, Orr was challenged by the veterans, and he earned respect by defeating Montreal tough guy Ted Harris in his first NHL fight. On December 4, 1966, Toronto Maple Leafs' defenceman Marcel Pronovost checked him into the boards, injuring Orr's knees for the first time in the NHL. He would miss nine games and the Bruins would lose six of them. The team finished with a 17-43-10 record, leaving the Bruins in last place. However, attendance at Boston Garden increased by forty-one thousand fans. For the season, Orr scored 13 goals and 28 assists, one of the best rookie seasons in NHL history to that point by a defenceman. Orr won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's outstanding rookie and was named to the NHL's Second All-Star team. New York Rangers defenceman Harry Howell won the Norris Trophy as the league's best defenceman that year. In accepting the award, Howell said he was glad to win when he did, predicting \\"Orr will own this trophy from now on.\\" Orr was runner-up in voting.

In 1344, the regency concluded a further alliance with Bulgaria, which required the surrender of Philippopolis and nine other towns in northern Thrace along the river Evros. Nevertheless, after their occupation, Ivan Alexander refrained from direct action against Kantakouzenos' forces operating in southern and eastern Thrace. At the same time, Momchil, a former brigand whom Kantakouzenos had entrusted with control over the region of Merope in the Rhodope mountains, switched over to the regency. In early 1344, Kantakouzenos was deprived of Umur and the bulk of his army, who had sailed home to repel a Latin attack on his main harbour, Smyrna. On their way, the Turkish force was attacked by the Serbs under Gregory Preljub, but prevailed at the Battle of Stephaniana. Nevertheless, Kantakouzenos was able to ward off joint attacks by Dušan and Apokaukos until Umur returned to his aid the next spring at the head of an army of 20,000 men. Kantakouzenos and Umur raided Bulgaria, and then turned against Momchil. The latter had exploited the power vacuum in the Rhodope, an effective no man's land between the Serbs, Bulgarians and Byzantines, to set himself up as a quasi-independent prince, supported by a substantial force of around 5,000 men. On 7 July 1345, the two armies clashed at Peritheorion. Momchil's army was crushed, and he himself fell in the field. Soon afterwards, Dušan arrived before Serres and laid siege to the city. Rejecting demands by Kantakouzenos to withdraw, a clash appeared inevitable until the murder of Alexios Apokaukos in Constantinople forced Kantakouzenos to direct his attention there.

Dustin Poirier: 'If I get in the cage with Eddie Alvarez, I'll take the belt' Since moving to lightweight, Dustin Poirier has not only become one of the most thrilling fighters to watch on the UFC roster, but he's quickly risen up the ranks as a top challenger in arguably the deepest division in the sport. Poirier has reeled off four straight wins with three of those finished by knockout or TKO including his last victory over Bobby Green at UFC 199. This latest streak came after Poirier was already considered a top five featherweight before the cut to get down to 145 pounds just became too taxing on his body. This weekend, Poirier faces Michael Johnson in the main event as the UFC lands in Hidalgo, Texas for the first time and his confidence is soaring because he's no longer just the guy who goes out and earns 'Performance of the Night' for a vicious knockout — he's a legitimate threat to any top lightweights and that includes champion Eddie Alvarez. “I've been fighting for a long time and you don't accidentally climb your way into the top of two different divisions. This is hard work and dedication at its finest. This is self belief. This is things happening the way they're supposed to,” Poirier told FOX Sports. At only 27 years old, Poirier is still reaching his athletic prime and now that he's no longer dehydrating his body to the point of exhaustion to get down to a lower weight class, he's feeling better than ever. Now Poirier isn't just hitting guys with good punches and hurting them — he's knocking them unconscious and when you combine that with a new dedication to his overall technique, the Louisiana native is a threat to anybody atop the lightweight division rankings. “I can knockout anybody. I'm getting stronger, my technique's getting better and I feel like I have my power back,” Poirier said. “At 45, I feel like I was hurting guys with those shots but I wasn't putting them away every time. Now I know if I land a flush shot, these hands will seal the deal and leave a hell of a mess out there. “I'm having fun again. The story of my last few fights is I'm having fun again, just enjoying this. Going out there and not looking to win on points. I go out there and push the pace and bring the violence.” Following his last win, Poirier hoped the UFC would give him a top five opponent so he was a little surprised that the name on the other end of the contract with Michael Johnson. Johnson is currently riding a two-fight losing streak including his last bout against Nate Diaz and he's ranked lower than Poirier in the top 10. Still, Poirier knows Johnson is a tough opponent with wins over some of the top fighters in the division and a number next to his name doesn't take away what he'll bring into the cage on Saturday night. “I was thinking a top five guy but to give him a little bit of credit, I thought he got robbed in that decision (against Beneil Dariush). That was B.S. He hung in there and fought a tough fight against Nate (Diaz) but when he fought Nate I think he was No. 5 or No. 6 and now he's No. 10,” Poirier said. “Since that loss, he's dropped in the rankings but he's still a dangerous guy. Let's not forget he has wins over Edson Barboza, Tony Ferguson, two of the top guys in the division right now. But that being said, he's also lost to guys we've never heard of. We'll see who shows up on Sept. 17.” “When I watch him fight, I see a guy who moves around a lot. A guy who I think I'm going to finish,” Poirier said. “I've been working hard all camp and that's what I expect to do. I feel like I'm better than him in every aspect of the fight. Boxing, if he thinks his boxing is his strong point, this is an uphill battle for him.” A fifth straight win for Poirier coupled with a victory in a main event should put him on the precipice of a very big opponent for his next fight. Poirier has been happy to climb the ranks and fight whoever the UFC puts in front of him, but he hopes with another big finish over Johnson on Saturday night that a top five opponent awaits him as a reward. “I'm going to go out there put on a great show, beat Michael Johnson and you don't win a main event fight and go back to the undercard. You go into bigger and better fights and that's what I'm on,” Poirier said. “I feel like after this win, one more two more I should be fighting for the belt if not sooner.” I believe right now if I get in the cage with Eddie Alvarez, I'll take the belt. I feel like I'm going to be the world champion and it's going to be soon. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Dustin Poirier, a fighter in the lightweight category, is very confident in his abilities and believes he can beat anyone, including the current champion Eddie Alvarez.

Write some highlights for the following article: Arsene Wenger's 65th birthday celebration finally went off with a bang on Wednesday night. When Lukas Poldolski hit the hugely unlikely 90th-minute winner here, frustrated Anderlecht fans threw an exploding firework on the pitch. It was an act of extreme recklessness but doubtless caused by utter frustration and disbelief in the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. As a knot of Arsenal players celebrated their unlikely saviour in Podolski in front of their travelling fans in one corner of the ground, all around there was a sense of incredulity. For 88 minutes Anderlecht, the Belgian champions, had not just held Arsenal at bay; in the second half they had dominated them. They were were well worth their 71st-minute opener, set up by the excellent Dennis Praet, once a Gunners trialist, and finished at the near post by Andy Najar. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger: Podolski is frustrated but we rely on him to score. Lukas Podolski smashes home in injury time to complete a remarkable turnaround at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. Goalscorer Podolski celebrates with team-mate Per Mertesacker after converting from close range in the dying moments. The Germany international is all smiles as he celebrates his strike and is then mobbed by his Arsenal team-mates (right) Alexis Sanchez leaps on to the back of Podolski after he scored the winner in Brussels in Arsenal's Champions League clash. Arsene Wenger turned 65 on Wednesday and he celebrated reaching that landmark with a late, late win in Belgium. Anderlecht: Proto, Vanden Borre, Mbemba, Deschacht, Acheampong, Tielemans, Defour, Najar, Praet (Dendoncker 88), Conte, Cyriac (Suarez 83). Subs Not Used: Roef, Colin, Kljestan, Kabasele, Mitrovic. Booked: Deschacht. Goals: Najar 71. Arsenal: Martinez, Chambers, Mertesacker, Monreal, Gibbs, Flamini (Oxlade-Chamberlain 74), Sanchez, Ramsey, Wilshere (Podolski 84), Cazorla, Welbeck (Campbell 74). Subs Not Used: Huddart, Rosicky, Arteta, Bellerin. Booked: Monreal, Welbeck. Goals: Gibbs 89, Podolski 90. Att: 25,000. Ref: Carlos Velasco Carballo (Madrid). Not only that, they should have finished Arsenal off. It was Emiliano Martinez, the 22-year-old goalkeeper on whom so much pressure had been placed, who kept them in the game, making a string of saves, notably from Matias Suarez on 84 minutes. And it was the post that rescued them from an Anthony Vanden Borre chip on 80 minutes. Arsenal were creaking, the limitations of this squad seemingly exposed for all Europe to see, as were their pretensions as challengers for this trophy. But something curious has happened to Arsenal this season; the spirit that once characterised this side has returned. Their late comebacks are becoming a regular feature of games. This, though, topped the lot. Wenger, understated as ever, took the dramatic last two minutes completely in his stride. ‘It’s a bit unexpected to take the three points, considering the quality of the match that Anderlecht played tonight,’ said Wenger, his lips curling into the beginnings of a grin. ‘I know by experience that the last five minutes in the Champions League, the nerves play a part. And that we had to get into these five minutes without conceding the second goal.’ ‘A bit unexpected’ was stretching it. When Calum Chambers advanced into Anderlecht’s half in the 89th minute there had barely been a significant Arsenal chance since Santi Cazorla forced a 64th-minute save from Silvio Proto. But Chambers, who had endured a troubled night, redeemed himself: his cross was superb, the finish from Kieran Gibbs, at the far post and drilled across goal, even better. That in itself would have represented something remarkable. Just over a minute later substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain advanced goalwards, with Anderlecht complaining bitterly of a foul. His pass found Alexis Sanchez, who shot, and amid a rebound and something of a scramble, up popped perennial reserve Podolski to record the most improbable victory. ‘We always know he can score,’ said Wenger, denying that his German World Cup winner had been close to leaving in the summer due to his lack of appearances. Kieran Gibbs started and finished his first Champions League goal. Click here for more from our brilliant Match Zone. Nacho Monreal is booked after just eight minutes - the Spaniard was playing at centre half with Arsenal down to the bare bones. Danny Welbeck led the line for Arsenal in Wednesday night's Champions League clash against Anderlecht. Santi Cazorla vies for the ball with Anderlecht's Andy Najar during the first half of Arsenal's European clash in Brussels. Aaron Ramsey holds his head in his hands after missing an opportunity to give Arsenal the lead during the second half. Cazorla sees his second-half shot saved by Anderlecht goalkeeper Silvio Proto. ‘He is frustrated and I understand that of course. But he’s important as well and he showed that tonight and he will be important in the coming months. It took him a while to get back to a good physical level after the World Cup and now he’s nearly there. ‘He has 115 caps for Germany; that is not a coincidence, that shows you the quality. I think he is a guy you want to have the ball in the box. His shot is fantastic, his accuracy is great and he has very short backlift.’ There was praise too for Martinez, very impressive since it was his third Arsenal appearance. I had no worry for our goalkeeper because he has the presence and the quality and he resists stress well. For the rest? There was little to say. ‘We had the spirit,’ said Wenger. ‘It was disappointing we didn’t create more chances tonight but I put that down to the fact as well that Anderlecht defended very well.' Prior to that spectacular ending, Wenger’s birthday celebrations were proving very flat in Brussels. It was as though all the invited guests turned up but there was no cake, an absence of party poppers and definitely no champagne moments.The vintage Arsenal of old, with which we associate Wenger, went missing. Najar was unmarked as he fired a bullet header past the diving Emiliano Martinez, the goalkeeper making his Arsenal bow. Najar celebrates his shock goal against Arsenal and is only the second Honduran to score in the Champions League. Kieran Gibbs finished with aplomb in the final minutes of the Champions League clash to haul his side level. The defender sinks to his knees and is congratulated by Monreal after scoring his first goal in the Champions League. A solid Anderlecht side, who made up in endeavour what they lacked in quality, were too much for the visitors. The first half was a rum affair, neither side displaying much quality other than on the defensive side. The second started more promisingly. Ibrahima Conte almost provided Arsenal with the unpleasant shock on 48 minutes. Mertesacker mistakenly let the ball run across the box and Conte found himself with time and space to shoot. His strike was deflected wide but it was enough to lift the Anderlecht crowd, who increasingly believed they had the measure of the Premier League side. Their cause gathered momentum when Praet, increasingly influential, had space to play in Conte down the left on 53 minutes. Chambers seemed to react slowly and for a moment the 23-year-old Anderlecht winger looked as though he had the measure of Arsenal’s right back, and was poised to beat him as Chambers struggled back. Ultimately Chambers came out on top, winning the ball back cleanly, despite penalty appeals from his opponents. Arsenal could muster precious little in response. Sanchez again got clear on 55 minutes and pulled back a cross but Ramsey fired his effort well wide. Cazorla then burst free on 64 minutes but was blocked by Silvio Porto with Sanchez lifting the rebound over. After that there was little more, until that finish. At least it can be said they saved the real celebration until last. Wenger turned 65 on Wednesday and handed a start to Martinez - the 22-year-old filling in for Wojciech Szczesny. The travelling Arsenal supporters appeared in good voice during the Group D Champions League clash in Belgium. The home fans respond to the vocal support from the visiting end. Anderlecht have been champions for the last three seasons in Belgium. Like our Arsenal Facebook page here.

Step 1: Ensure Your Candied Ginger is Properly Dried To ensure that your candied ginger pieces will stay fresh for an extended period, it is crucial that they are thoroughly dried before storing them. If there is any excess moisture in the ginger pieces, it can lead to mold and spoilage. To dry the candied ginger, lay the pieces on a baking sheet and let them rest at room temperature for a few hours until there is no visible moisture on their surface. Step 2: Choose the Right Storage Container Selecting an appropriate storage container is essential for preserving the freshness of your candied ginger pieces. Use an airtight container made from glass or food-grade plastic, as these materials will prevent air and moisture from entering the container and spoiling your ginger. An airtight jar with a screw-on lid or a plastic container with a snap-lock lid are excellent choices. Step 3: Line the Storage Container Before placing the candied ginger pieces in the storage container, line the bottom with a sheet of parchment paper. This will help prevent the ginger pieces from sticking to the container and makes them easier to remove later on. Additionally, adding a layer of parchment paper can also help absorb any residual moisture that may still remain in the ginger pieces. Step 4: Place Candied Ginger in the Container Arrange the candied ginger pieces in your prepared container, making sure to leave some space between each piece. This will prevent the pieces from sticking together and makes it easier to remove individual ginger pieces from the container later on. Leaving space between the pieces can also improve air circulation, reducing the risk of mold or spoilage. Step 5: Store in a Cool, Dark Place To further preserve the freshness of your candied ginger pieces, it is essential to store the container in a cool, dark location, such as a pantry or cupboard. The ideal storage temperature is between 50-70°F (10-21°C), away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and moisture. Exposure to high temperatures or direct sunlight can cause the candied ginger to soften or even melt, while excessive moisture can lead to spoilage. Step 6: Check on Your Candied Ginger Periodically It's a good idea to inspect your stored candied ginger occasionally to ensure that it is still in good condition. If you notice any signs of mold, discard the affected ginger pieces and clean the container thoroughly before re-storing the remaining ginger. Additionally, if the ginger has become overly hard or has lost its distinct flavor, it may be time to replace your supply. Conclusion By following these simple steps, you can store your candied ginger pieces for up to three months, ensuring they remain fresh and flavorful. Proper storage not only helps prolong the shelf life of your candied ginger but also ensures that you can enjoy its taste and health benefits for an extended period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A bizarre invasive worm with its mouth in the middle of its belly has been found in the United States for the first time, according to new research. The New Guinea flatworm (Platydemus manokwari) is only a couple of millimeters thick but grows to be up to 2.5 inches (65 millimeters) long. As its name suggests, the worm is a New Guinea native, but it has been spreading across the globe, hitching rides on exotic plants and in soil. The worm wraps itself around snails and ingests them with a mouthlike structure on its underside. As an invasive species, it's a threat to native snails — so much so that the Invasive Species Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists it among the 100 worst invasive species in the world. The flatworm had previously been detected in the wild in 15 countries, as well as in a greenhouse in France, but this is the first time it's been found in North America. A multinational group of researchers, led by scientists at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in France, combed through flatworm specimens and photographs collected by locals around the world. [See Photos of Bizarre Flatworm & Other Destructive Invasive Species] Spreading threat The researchers discovered P. manokwari in five countries and territories where it had never been reported before: New Caledonia, a small collection of islands in the southwest Pacific; Singapore; the Solomon Islands, also in the southwest Pacific; Puerto Rico; and Florida. A New Guinea flatworm discovered in Coral Gables, Florida. This is the first report of this invasive flatworm on the American continent. Credit: Courtesy of Makiri Sei. CC- BY 4.0 The introduction of the species appeared to be recent in many of these cases. The worm probably arrived in Florida in or around 2012, the researchers reported in the open-access journal PeerJ. Since then, it seems to have established itself and can now be found in multiple places in Miami-Dade County. In Puerto Rico, the worm showed up in San Juan, the capital, in 2014. The first discovery of the worm in the Solomon Islands also occurred in 2014, on Guadalcanal. Wormy genetics The researchers also discovered two genetic groups, or haplotypes, of the worm. These two groups are virtually indistinguishable except on the level of their genetic codes. One, dubbed the \\"Australian haplotype,\\" was found only in Australia and the Solomon Islands. The other, dubbed the \\"World haplotype,\\" has been found in France, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Singapore, the Solomon Islands and Puerto Rico. The specimens found in Florida also belonged to this World haplotype. The genetic findings suggest that both haplotypes of worm exist in their native New Guinea, but that for unknown reasons, only the World haplotype has spread significantly, the researchers wrote. The discovery of the flatworm in the United States is particularly concerning because the flatworm had previously been confined mostly to small islands, they added. From Florida, however, P. manokwari could easily spread to the rest of the United States and the Americas. Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitter and Google+. Follow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

All specimens from France (3), New Caledonia (9 from different localities), Singapore, Florida and Puerto Rico (2 in each case) were identical and displayed the World haplotype; all specimens from Townsville had the Australian haplotype with a minor difference of one base for one specimen (haplotype Australian 2). Sequences from Henderson (Solomon Islands) were identical in the five specimens, with haplotype Australian 1. In contrast, the ten specimens from Dodo Creek included three animals with haplotype Australian 1 and seven with haplotype World. The Solomon Islands were thus the only country in which genetic variation among specimens was observed. The analysis of the 21 long sequences also revealed the same two haplotypes, World and Australian. The difference between the two haplotypes was 42 bases, on a total of 848 ( p -distance: 4.8%; kimura-2 parameter distance: 5.0%). A minor variation was found in the Australian haplotype, with one specimen having a one-base difference (distance from this specimen to the World haplotype: p -distance: 5.0%; kimura-2 parameter distance: 5.2%); this haplotype is designated as “Australian 2” and the other, major haplotype is designated as “Australian 1”. No variation was found in the World haplotype (15 sequences from four countries) for these long sequences. A tree constructed from these sequences shows two well differentiated branches, with identical sequences in the World haplotype branch and minor variation in the Australian haplotype branch ( Fig. 6 ). The analysis of the 38 “short” sequences showed that only two haplotypes were present. One haplotype was found in specimens from France, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Singapore, Florida and Puerto Rico, and certain specimens from the Solomon Islands; we designate it as the “World haplotype”. One haplotype was found only in specimens from Australia and certain specimens from the Solomon Islands; we designate it as the “Australian haplotype”. The difference between the two haplotypes was 15 bases, on a total of 401 ( p -distance: 3.7%; kimura-2 parameter distance: 3.8%); no individual variation of these “short” sequences was found in any of the two haplotypes. A tree constructed from these sequences shows two well differentiated branches, with identical sequences in each of the branches ( Fig. 5 ). We obtained COI sequences from 38 individuals. Of these, 21 were “long” sequences, obtained with two pairs of primers, and 17 were “short” sequences, when only one pair of primers provided results. The dimensions and characters that were compared between specimens of the two haplotypes included body length and width, the distance of the mouth and gonopore from the anterior end, the lengths of the oesophagus, pharynx and pharyngeal pouch, distance between the common sperm duct and common ovovitelline duct, distance from the common sperm duct to the tip of the penis papilla, penis length and penis width at it base, length of the male atrium, length of the female atrium, length of the glandular canal, length of the common ovovitelline duct and depth of the viscid gland. Sexually mature specimens of P. manokwari from the Solomon Islands were found to be considerably smaller (22–28 mm long) than those from Caen, France (44.5 mm long) and Townsville, Australia (45 mm long). The only characters that were found that may possibly differentiate between the two haplotypes are the length of the penis papilla expressed as a percentage of the total body length ( Table 2 ), and the shape of the penis papilla. Specimens of the World haplotype generally exhibited a finger-shaped or elongate conical penis papilla that was 1.4–1.7% of the body length, similar in appearance of the copulatory organs of P. manokwari figured by de Beauchamp (Figs. 1A and 1B in de Beauchamp, 1962 ) whereas in specimens of the Australian haplotype the penis papillae tended to be a low regular conical shape with a length less than 1% of the total body length (0.7–0.9% of the body length), closely resembling the copulatory organs of P. manokwari figured by de Beauchamp (Fig. 1 in de Beauchamp, 1972 ) and by Winsor (1990) (Fig. 1 in Winsor, 1998 ). The flatworms ( Figs. 1 – 4 ) presented the following morphological characteristics: body broadest in the middle, tapering evenly anteriorly but more abruptly posteriorly; two large prominent eyes back from the tip of the elongate snout-like head; dorsum a dark olive brown colour; pale cream median dorsal longitudinal stripe beginning just behind the eyes and continuing to the posterior tip; olive brown colour grading to grey at anterior tip; two thin submarginal cream stripes with fine lower greyish margin running laterally from the anterior end along the length of the body; ventral surface a pale finely mottled light brown. These features are consistent with those of Platydemus manokwari de Beauchamp, 1963 (Platyhelminthes, Continenticola, Geoplanidae, Rhynchodeminae) ( de Beauchamp, 1962 ; Justine et al., 2014 ; Kawakatsu, Ogren & Muniappan, 1992 ; Winsor, 1990 ). Time of invasion and other remarks In France, after the first finding of P. manokwari (October 2013), the hothouse of the Jardin des Plantes in Caen in which the species was found was closed and public access restricted. In April 2014, a thorough search was performed in the same hothouse. Several species of land planarians were found (some are still unidentified), including four adult specimens of P. manokwari. A citizen-based survey of land planarians in France (Thévenot, Justine & Rome, 2014), supported by important media involvement (list of links: https://peerj.com/articles/297/#links), yielded hundreds of records of non-indigenous land planarians in France (Justine, 2014; Justine, Thévenot & Winsor, 2014) but never a record of P. manokwari in the wild. The presence of the species in Singapore had already been noted in 2010, according to unpublished observations listed in Table 1, and the species is probably spreading; according to the observations of one of us (AWKH), the species was not present in his garden before 2013. Local observations show that P. manokwari predates the introduced giant African snail, Achatina fulica Bowdich, 1822. The detection of P. manokwari in New Caledonia is recent (2014). After the discovery of the first specimens in the capital city, Nouméa, in April 2014, a survey was conducted from September 2014 to April 2015. Specimens were found in several places in the mainland, including Southern and Northern Provinces, and in two of the three Loyalty Islands, Maré and Lifou. The current extensive distribution of such a cryptic species, evidenced after only eight months of survey, suggests that the introduction of P. manokwari is not recent. Moreover, discussions with scientists involved in the observation of soil species revealed that the flatworm had been observed several years ago, but no substantiated proof of these observations could be found. Since a number of endemic land planarians exist in New Caledonia (Schröder, 1924; Winsor, 1991), it could not be ascertained if these earlier observations were actually of P. manokwari, or of other species. P. manokwari was not detected when large surveys were conducted in the 1990s (Gargominy et al., 1996)—it is thus likely that its introduction occurred in the last 20 years. Local observations show that P. manokwari predates introduced A. fulica. In Wallis and Futuna, our records of P. manokwari are based only on two photographs taken by one of us (JYM), in 2007 in Uvea (Wallis Islands) and in 2008 in Futuna (Hoorn Islands). These two island groups are separated by more than 100 km of sea. No more recent records are available. The presence of P. manokwari on Guam has been known since 1977 (Eldredge & Smith, 1995; Hopper & Smith, 1992). Our records, dated 2004, confirm the continuing presence of the species; to our knowledge, no more recent records are available. In the USA, the accidental introduction of P. manokwari through human agency to Florida is probably recent, with our first specimens found in August 2012. The species is apparently now well established, with several different locations found in 2014 in Miami Dade County (Table 1). The introduction of P. manokwari to Puerto Rico is also probably recent, with the first specimens found in December 2014, in a single locality, San Juan (Table 1). To our knowledge, no survey aiming specifically at detecting P. manokwari has been done in other parts of Florida or in other US states. Land planarians are often photographed by amateurs; however, a survey of various websites and various Google searches (December 2014) did not reveal any photographic report of P. manokwari in the US. The introduction of the species to Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands also seems recent (2014). Specimens of P. manokwari were found in fields invaded by the introduced Giant African snail, Achatina fulica. Although the report of these flatworms in Guadalcanal is recent, we do not know if this is truly an indication of a recent introduction or not. The case of New Caledonia, where the species was found in many localities after a coordinated participative survey was initiated, and, on the contrary, the case of Guam, for which we have no report for the last decade, show that land planarians are detected and reported only when an appropriate survey is undertaken. It is obvious that land planarians in Solomon Islands, a country with low income and expensive internet access, are less often photographed by amateur photographers who post their findings on the internet than they are in the US or Singapore. Figure 7 shows all available records of P. manokwari in the world. The spread of the species mainly concerns countries and territories in the Pacific Area; Florida and Puerto Rico are the first records in the Americas. The record in Florida is the first on the American mainland. ||||| Why are Earthworms Important Only a few decades ago, the predominating thought was that earthworms were not very important for agriculture. Emphasis was placed on physical and chemical aspects of plant growth while biological aspects were neglected. We are now realizing how interactions between crops, climate, soil, and living organisms play important roles in sustaining our agriculture. Earthworms are among the most visible of soil organisms and have received considerable attention. They play a pivotal role in maintaining the productivity of our soils. This makes understanding these lowly animals and finding ways to make them thrive very important. Benefits of Earthworms The burrowing and feeding activity of earthworms have numerous beneficial effects on overall soil quality for crop production. The following soil properties can be improved by earthworms. Water infiltration Some earthworm species create vertical burrows, whereas other species live in horizontal burrows in the soil. The vertical burrows are typically open, although the worms cap the top with residue and excrement. The vertical burrows are very important points of entry for quick water infiltration into the soil, especially in no-till systems. Soil aeration Air-filled porosity is critical in helping plant roots to thrive. Roots need oxygen for their growth, whereas they produce carbon dioxide that needs to leave the soil. Because earthworms improve soil porosity, they improve the exchange of these gases with the atmosphere. Earthworms increase porosity by two mechanisms: (1) by creating permanent burrows, and (2) by improving soil aggregation. Aggregation is improved by the mixing of soil and organic matter in the earthworms’ guts. These highly stable aggregates are deposited by some earthworms in their burrows, and by others at the surface of the soil. In one pasture study, earthworms consumed between 20 and 40 tons of soil per acre per year. In another study, earthworms were estimated to consume 4 to 10 percent of the top 6 inches of the soil annually. This only goes to show the enormous amounts of soil that can be processed by earthworms. Soil compaction and soil tilth Soil compaction reduces the porosity of the soil. Because earthworms increase porosity, they reduce the effects of compaction. In addition, the excrement of earthworms has a very stable structure, which makes the soil more resistant to compaction and improves its tilth. Soil organic matter Typical earthworm populations can easily consume 2 tons of dry matter per acre per year, partly digesting and mixing it with soil. The importance of earthworms to mix surface residue with soil becomes very clear in soils that do not have any earthworms. Most of our Pennsylvania soils have at least some earthworms and the effect of their complete absence therefore cannot be noted. In the Netherlands, some soils reclaimed from the sea at first did not have any earthworms. In these soils the formation of topsoil with reasonable organic matter content did not take place, resulting in poor crop growth. Once the cause was established, the government of the Netherlands started a campaign to introduce earthworms. After the introduction of the earthworms, a dark topsoil layer was formed, and crop growth increased substantially. Plant available nutrients Earthworm casts have higher available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium contents than surrounding soil, as well as a higher cation-exchange capacity. Some micronutrients, such as zinc and boron, are more available in the excrement of earthworms through chelation of the micronutrients. Soil pH Soil passed through the gut of earthworms has a neutral pH. This is probably due to the pH buffering action of organic molecules produced in the gut of worms. Beneficial microbes Earthworms excrete material that has high concen- trations of beneficial microbes that help decompose crop residue. Nematode control Some earthworms eat harmful nematodes, thus decreasing the concentration of these harmful organisms in soil. Types of Earthworms There are more than 1,000 different earthworm species, but they can be placed into one of three groups (Fig. 1): Litter dwellers or epigeic species live in crop or forest litter. They are not common in most agricultural soils. These species do not ingest large amounts of soil. The manure or red worm, Eisenia foetida, is an example of a litter dweller. Topsoil dwellers or endogeic species live in the upper 2 to 3 inches of the soil. They live primarily from partially decomposed organic matter that is already incorporated in the soil. They eat their way through the soil, creating horizontal burrows that they fill with their excrement. These species ingest large amounts of soil that they mix with digested crop residue in their guts. Subsoil dwellers or anecic species live in permanent vertical burrows that can be 5 or 6 feet deep. These earthworms need surface crop residue to live. Their burrows remain open, although they cap the top with crop residue that they pull to the entrance. These species ingest substantial amounts of soil that they mix with digested residue in their guts. Their excrement is primarily deposited at the surface of the soil. The nightcrawler Lumbricus terrestris is the most prominent member of this group. Figure 1. Three major groups of earthworms are: litter dwellers, topsoil dwellers, and subsoil dwellers. Earthworm Biology Earthworms are invertebrates composed of many segments (Fig. 1). They don’t have bones and move by contracting and relaxing the body segments in sequence. They also have little bristlelike organs that help them cling to slippery surfaces. Most earthworms have both male and female organs. Typically, however, they still need a partner to reproduce. When earthworms mate, they lay side by side in reverse position. At that moment they exchange sperm. The sperm of the partner is stored in little chambers called spermathecal apertures. These are positioned in front of the egg-producing organs. After mating, the swollen external gland, called clitellum, produces egg cases called cocoons. A cocoon case slides slowly forward, picking up eggs and sperm as it moves over the head of the earthworm. From 3 to 1,000 cocoons can be produced per year, depending on species and environmental conditions. Typically, an earthworm will produce 20 to 30 cocoons per year, with each cocoon containing 1 to 10 eggs. Peak cocoon production is in the spring or early summer. The eggs in the cocoons hatch when conditions are right. Under ideal conditions, it may take from 1 to 5 months for the eggs to hatch. It may then take from 3 to 12 months before these worms are sexually mature. Worms typically live only a few months because of the many environmental threats they face. They have been observed to live for 10 years in a protected environment. In a favorable environment previously without earthworms, earthworm populations increased 80-fold in 4 years after introduction. Environmental Effects on Earthworms The burrowing and feeding activity of earthworms, as well as their overall population, are affected by the soil environment in which they live. Some of the properties important to earthworms include the following. Moisture Earthworms absorb and lose moisture through their skin. If soils are dry, earthworms may move to deeper soil layers, die, or revert to a hibernation condition called diapause. Earthworms in diapause are tied up in a knot in a little hole that is lined with a slimy substance to avoid moisture loss. Eggs in cocoons survive prolonged drought, allowing earthworm populations to survive drought periods. Because of dry conditions, earthworm populations in Pennsylvania are low in the summer. Earthworms can live under submerged conditions if the oxygen content of the water is high enough. In most cases, however, earthworms will die when exposed to excessive waterlogging. They move to the surface when the soil is saturated to avoid suffocation. Temperature Most earthworms don’t tolerate temperatures below freezing, nor do they tolerate high temperatures. Prolonged exposure to temperatures above 95°F kills them. They can move down into the soil to escape these adverse temperatures. Optimum temperatures are between 50 and 60°F. pH Earthworms commonly found in agricultural fields thrive at neutral pH, but can tolerate a pH from 5.0 to 8.0. Soil texture Earthworms prefer soils with loamy texture. Coarse sand can be a negative factor either because the abrasive action of sand grains damages their skin, or because these soils dry out more easily. In some studies, clay soils had fewer earthworms than lighter-textured soils. The reason for this phenomenon is not clear. Food supply Quantity, quality, and placement of food influence earthworm populations. Earthworms eat organic residue that needs to be present in sufficient quantity. The quality of residue is also important. Residue with a high carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio is not very palatable for earthworms. Manure can help make it more palatable. Packed manure is an excellent food source for earthworms. In some cases, residue has to undergo some weathering before earthworms are able to digest it. Topsoil dwellers need smaller particles than subsoil dwellers, which can use large leaves, for example. The placement of food becomes a critical issue for some earthworm species. Topsoil dwellers prefer small organic residue particles incorporated into the soil, but subsurface dwellers need residue at the surface of the soil. Management Effects on Earthworms Soil and crop management practices can influence many soil properties that affect earthworms (Fig. 2). Some practices can have immediate effects on earthworms, whereas others may gradually change earthworm population and activities over several years. So when you are considering management options, you should also think about their effects on earthworms. Some of the more important management effects on earthworms are described below. Figure 2. Management practices favoring/hurting earthworms. Tillage Soil tillage greatly affects earthworms (Table 1). The burial of crop residue and manure by tillage favors topsoil dwellers over subsoil dwellers. In long-term clean-tilled fields, nightcrawlers are scarce. Tillage also stimulates drying the surface soil and wide day/night temperature fluctuations. This is another reason earthworms are less numerous in clean-tilled fields compared to no-tilled fields. Tillage brings earthworms to the surface where they are subject to predators such as birds. Total earthworm populations in long-term no-tilled fields are typically at least twice those of clean-tilled fields. Table 1. Earthworm Populations as Affected by Management Tillage Management Earthworms/Acre From Earthworms and Crop Management by E. J. Kladivko, 1993. Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service Agronomy Guide AY-279. Crop and management systems had been continuous for at least 10 years. Continuous corn Plow 39,000 Continuous corn No-till 78,000 Continuous soybean Plow 235,000 Continuous soybean No-till 549,000 Bluegrass-clover Alleyway 1,568,000 Dairy pasture Manure 1,333,000 Dairy pasture Manure (heavy) 5,097,000 Crop rotation Providing earthworms with a diverse diet is important. Crop residue of leguminous species (low C:N ratio) is more palatable to earthworms than that of mature grass and grain species (high C:N ratio). However, a legume such as soybean produces very little crop residue, which limits the quantity of food available to earthworms. Earthworms thrive in grasslands and alfalfa. In one grassland study, 70 earthworms were counted per square foot (more than 3 million earthworms per acre). Crop residue If crop residue is removed, earthworms lose their food source. Use of a cover crop that is left in the field or removal of only part of the crop are ways to feed earthworms. Manure Manure is a food source for earthworms. It also makes crop residue with a high C:N ratio more palatable to earthworms. Manure stimulates crop residue production because of its fertilizing effect, increasing the food supply for earthworms. Liquid manure can have a temporary depressing effect on earthworms due to its ammonia and salt content. After this effect has subsided, however, earthworm populations tend to increase. Organic amendments Sludge and compost can greatly stimulate earthworm populations by providing a quality feedstock for them. Fertilizer and lime There is good evidence that most inorganic fertilizers favor the buildup of large numbers of earthworms, probably due to the increased amounts of crop residues being returned to the soil. Anhydrous ammonia and ammonium sulfate have been found to have negative effects on earthworms. This may be due to the acidifying effect of this fertilizer, but also due to the toxic effect of ammonia. Liming to neutralize acidity stimulates earthworm activity. Pesticides The effects of pesticides on earthworms depend on the type of pesticide and its rate of application, earthworm species and age, and environmental conditions. Appendix 1 gives test results of pesticide toxicity on earthworms. The studies simulated normal exposure rates of pesticides commonly used in field crops. The table summarizes a great number of different studies that used widely varying methods of evaluation and should therefore be used with caution. Most inorganic chemicals tested are no longer in use as pesticides. Based on the limited amount of information available, these chemicals do not seem to be very toxic to earthworms, except when they accumulate in soil over a long period of time. Organochlorine insecticides were extensively used from the 1950s to the 1970s, but are not used in large quantities today. Endosulfan and lindane are moderately toxic and probably toxic at normal exposure rates, respectively. Some organophosphate insecticides, such as acephate, azinphos methyl, chlorpyrifos, ethoprophos, ethyl- parathion, and phorate are very toxic to earthworms. The other organophosphate insecticides listed are nontoxic to moderately toxic to earthworms. Carbamate insecticides and fungicides are very toxic to earthworms. Carbaryl and carbofuran, both commonly used in field crop production, are extremely toxic to earthworms. Pyrethroid insecticides, on the other hand, have not been found to be toxic to earthworms. Most contact fumigant nematicides/fungicides are broad-spectrum biocides that will kill most earthworms, even those living deep in the soil. Of the other fungicides tested, none were found to be toxic to earthworms except carbamate fungicides such as benomyl and carbendazim (not listed). Most herbicides are nontoxic to earthworms, although some, such as 2,4-D, pendimethalin, and simazine, are toxic at high exposure rates. Similar to that of humans, pesticide health risks to earthworms depend not only on the toxicity of the chemical but also on the exposure to it. On the other hand, earthworms that crawl on the soil surface (such as nightcrawlers) have a higher exposure to surface- applied pesticides than those feeding and burrowing below the soil surface. On the other hand, pesticides injected in a small slot in the soil (such as the seed slot) may not come in contact with many earthworms and therefore will not pose a significant threat for the population at large. Remember that earthworms are most active in the spring and fall under favorable temperature and moisture conditions. Pesticide application during these periods is most likely to pose a threat to earthworms. If the soil is moist, earthworms will be more active and therefore more likely to come into contact with pesticides. The effects of pesticides on earthworms also depend on age of the earthworms. Juvenile earthworms are more sensitive to pesticides than adults because they move slower and are not able to burrow away deep into the soil. Appendix.

They help improve soil structure and soil chemical and biological properties. They are especially important in no-till, helping to stimulate air and water movement in soil. Earthworms tend to thrive most without tillage, if sufficient crop residue is left on the soil surface.

Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Article: A FORMER Queensland internet king is believed to have been a key figure behind FBI action against three major gambling websites in the United States. Daniel Tzvetkoff, who had been facing 75 years jail in the US, has done a deal with prosecutors which has seen him freed on bail and living in a secret New York location. The Courier-Mail reported today that the deal came after Tzvetkoff - a Brisbane boy wonder, who started a company with school mates at 13 - became embroiled in a massive, 543 million stew of money laundering, bank fraud and conspiracy that could bring down the world of online gambling. Federal prosecutors in New York yesterday charged the founders of the three largest internet poker companies in the US with bank fraud, money laundering and other gambling offenses and are seeking penalties upward of 3 billion. Federal authorities also froze approximately 76 bank accounts in 14 countries that contain proceeds from the alleged offenses. They also shut down five internet domain names used by the three companies to host their games. A total of 11 defendants, including the founders of Poker Stars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker, were named in the indictment unsealed Friday. The Courier-Mail reported today that two of those companies Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars, had been seeking 100m they believed Tzvetkoff had taken from them. Tzvetkoff was arrested in April last year and charged with money laundering, bank fraud and conspiracy for processing 543m in illegal internet gambling earnings through his British Virgin Islands corporation, Intabill, the trading arm of his now liquidated Brisbane company, BT Projects. He was mysteriously bailed last August, and US authorities are using his inside knowledge of the gambling industry to go after gaming companies. In yesterday's indictment, federal prosecutors explain that poker companies operating offshore cannot accept most forms of payment \\"in connection with the participation of another person in unlawful internet gambling.\\" Since most banks in the US would not process their payments, the companies circumvented federal law by making payments appear to be transactions for other types of merchandise. In the indictment, federal prosecutors say they arranged for payment processors with bank accounts in the US to receive payments from US gamblers and disguise them as payments for products such as jewelry or golf balls. Of the billions of dollars in payment transactions that the Poker Companies tricked US banks into processing, approximately one-third or more of the funds went directly to the Poker Companies as revenue through a charge players must make on almost every poker hand played online. That scheme worked for a while until some banks caught on. By 2009, they had shut down many fraudulent bank accounts used by the poker companies. Two of the defendants later came up with a scheme to persuade the principals of a few small, struggling banks to process payments in return for multi-million investments. In one case, they persuaded the vice chairman of SunFirst Bank in Saint George, Utah, to process gambling transactions in return for a 10 million investment. \\"As charged, these defendants concocted an elaborate criminal fraud scheme, alternately tricking some US banks and effectively bribing others to assure the continued flow of billions in illegal gambling profits,\\" said Preet Bharara, US Attorney in Manhattan. \\"Moreover, as we allege, in their zeal to circumvent the gambling laws, the defendants also engaged in massive money laundering and bank fraud.\\" Read more on Tzvetkoff in today's print edition of The Courier-Mail. ||||| The U.S. government disrupted the weekend—and life—plans of Cory Albertson and thousands of others like him who earn much of their living playing poker online. Federal prosecutors have targeted the three largest online poker companies doing business in the U.S., charging their founders with money laundering and bank fraud and seizing five of the companies' domain names. Alexandra Berzon has details. For nearly eight years, Mr. Albertson has camped out every Sunday on his couch with his laptop to play No Limit Hold'Em with thousands of other online players at PokerStars or Full Tilt Poker. He might pocket 500 for the day, or lose money, but sometimes he'd win big, as much as 75,000 at a time, adding a nice sum to his income as a freelance writer in Austin, Texas. The U.S. Justice Department announced Friday it was blocking players in the U.S. from accessing Full Tilt Poker, along with other online poker sites, accusing 11 people of bank fraud and of illegally operating gambling websites. The government seized accounts run by the sites that held money stored by players. The crackdown came after years of tension between the sites and the U.S. government, which long held that online gambling is illegal. The case could test the claim by the poker site operators that operating a poker site online isn't illegal because, they say, as a game that involves skill, poker is not gambling. The government action shined a light on a game that had become a vocation for thousands of Americans and pastime for millions of casual players. Online poker has spawned an industry of celebrity players, bloggers, coaches and television shows sponsored by the sites now charged with criminal activity. \\"We understood there were issues,\\" said Jonathan Wein, a professional poker player who runs a business teaching poker online. \\"We never assumed there'd be some type of black-out overnight.\\" Congress passed a law in 2006 that forbid financial institutions from processing financial transactions related to online gambling. That made it much more difficult for websites to accept money from players and pay them back. Many sites left the U.S after the law passed. Others, namely Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars, built lucrative businesses by catering to U.S. players from overseas. PokerStars is based in the Isle of Man, Full Tilt is regulated by Alderney in the U.K.'s Channel Islands and Absolute Poker, another site, is in Costa Rica. The approach seemed to work, allowing the sites to build a market that last year included about 1.8 million people in the U.S. who played poker online for money, according to PokerScout, which tracks online poker site data. Other organizations say there are many more players. The sites saw around 16 billion in wagers from U.S. players last year, with the bulk of that taken in by Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars, according to PokerScout. The indictment last week and accompanying civil complaint alleged that the companies skirted the 2006 ban on electronic transfers related to gambling by working with third parties to create fictitious websites for fake companies to trick banks into thinking that it was not an Internet poker site. One was Green2YourGreen, an apparent environmentally-friendly household products company. In later years the sites invested in small U.S. banks in exchange for their cooperation in processing funds, the government alleges. Enlarge Image Close Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Last year about 1.8 million people in the U.S. played poker online for money, according to PokerScout. Full Tilt said in a statement that it \\"is, and has always been committed to preserving the integrity of the game and abiding by the law.\\" Representatives for PokerStars and Full Tilt didn't respond to requests for comment. Absolute Poker representatives could not be reached. Regular online players said in interviews that while they were aware that financial transactions had become difficult under U.S. law, they turned a blind eye to the specifics. \\"All of the fake websites and phony bank accounts—that was something the players assumed was taking place,\\" Mr. Albertson said. \\"But we're totally detached from that. We didn't know exactly how it works. We just knew it did work.\\" In 2009, the government began seizing bank accounts managed by third-party processors, such as Allied Systems Inc. and Account Services, which held millions of dollars of player money. Poker players say that their money was reimbursed by the sites. Yet since then, cashing out began to take more time and checks were issued under numerous different account names, the players said. In a statement on its website PokerStars said that players would get their money back. Mr. Wein said he had about 15,000 in his poker accounts. More than the fate of that money, he's concerned that poker playing and teaching won't be as lucrative now. \\"Our entire business plan has changed overnight,\\" he said. Players may move to other sites, although many say they're hesitant to do so. The number of U.S. players using Bodog, a gambling website that wasn't named in the government suit, showed a 21% rise in player numbers on Saturday compared to a week earlier, a gain of around 150 players, according to Dan Stewart, who runs PokerScout. In interviews, several professionals said they may transfer to live games—even though that is likely to bring in less income, in part because the players can't play as many games at one time. Some also said they are considering moving abroad. \\"Online I can play 500 tournaments a week,\\" Mr. Wein said. \\"In a casino it might be three to five.\\" Mr. Wein was among the players this weekend who said they'll consider moving abroad so they can continue playing. For Mr. Albertson, the crackdown is likely to bring a new career path—and schedule. \\"I was joking with my girlfriend, 'I guess now I have to learn how to socialize with people on Sundays,'\\" he said.

Article: Please enable Javascript to watch this video OKEMAH, Okla. -- A 4-year-old was allegedly forced by his teacher to write with his right hand, even though he’s left-handed. The child was sent home with a letter about how left-handedness is often associated with evil and the devil. Zayde is only 4 years old. It's his first year at Oakes Elementary in Okemah, but his mom kept him home Monday after a dispute with his teacher over being left-handed. Zayde, like most kids in Pre-K, is learning how to read and write. And like his mom, Alisha, Zayde is a lefty. “From picking things up to throwing things, to batting, to writing, to just coloring you’d do at home with him, he’s always, always used his left hand,” Alisha Sands said. That was until last week at homework time. Alisha asked him why he was writing with his right hand, not his left. “I just asked ‘Is there anything his teachers ever asked about his hands?’ And he raises this one and says this one’s bad,” Sands said. Alisha sent the teacher a note and got a strong response. It was an article calling left-handedness “unlucky,” “evil,” and “sinister.” It even says “for example, the devil is often portrayed as left-handed.” Alisha couldn’t believe it. “It breaks my heart for him because someone actually believes that, believes my child is evil because he’s left handed, it’s crazy,” Sands said. She went to the superintendent with the article. “There was no suspension of any kind. There was basically nothing done to this teacher,” Sands says, “She told them she thought I needed literature on it.” Zayde will likely transfer to another class just two months into the school year. “I don’t feel like the school did what they were supposed to for him,” Sands said. NewsChannel 4 called the school and were told the superintendent was out Monday, so they transferred us to the principal at Oakes Elementary. She said she’s aware of the situation and the district is investigating. She hung up before we could ask any questions. Sands is going to file a formal complaint with the Oklahoma Board of Education. ||||| A pre-K teacher in Oklahoma is making news this week after forcing a left-handed 4-year-old boy to write with his right hand. The boy was sent home from school with an article discussing left- and right-handedness. The article mentions historic attitudes toward left-handedness that associate it with evil and the devil. It's written carelessly enough that it isn't clear whether the writer believes left-handedness is still seen as evil or whether that was only the case in the past. Regardless, it's surprising that today, in 2015, a teacher would try to force a child to write with his non-dominant hand. Roughly 10 percent of people are left-handed, according Chris McManus, a University College of London researcher who wrote a book chapter on the history and geography of left-handedness. Scientists generally agree that there is a strong genetic component that determines whether a person is right- or left-handed. But good data on the prevalence of left-handedness has been difficult to find, McManus writes. One of the best available data sets on left-handedness comes from a scratch-and-sniff survey of olfactory ability mailed out to millions of National Geographic subscribers in the 1980s. Go ahead and read that sentence again — it doesn't get any less weird the second time around. In 1986, National Geographic published a special issue on smell. As McManus recounts it, the issue \\"was accompanied by a 'scratch and sniff' card, which readers were encouraged to scratch, report what, if anything, they could smell, and then, after completing a brief demographic questionnaire, return the card.\\" The researchers who created the survey, from the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, thought that smell and handedness might be linked. So they included questions about the dominant hand used for writing and throwing things in their demographic section. So, 1.4 million people scratched, sniffed and mailed back their cards. As it turned out there was no link between smell and left-handedness, but the resulting 1.4 million datapoints created the largest dataset of hand preference ever constructed. As an opt-in survey of magazine readers, it has obvious weaknesses. Ninety-seven percent of respondents were white, and National Geographic readers in the 1980s were almost certainly economically and demographically distinct from the general population in other ways, too. Still, the sheer size of the database gave researchers a glimpse into the geography and history of left-handedness that they'd never had before. For starters, they show that rates of left-handedness fell during the late Victorian era, reaching their nadir in the early 1900s. They then rebounded steadily until about the 1950s or so, when they flattened out. McManus theorizes that the late-Victorian dive in left-handedness reflects stigma against southpaws, of the kind that might have been on display in that elementary school in Oklahoma. He attributes a lot of that to the Industrial Revolution. \\"Left-handers may also have appeared less capable and more clumsy, as left-handed adults worked on machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind, and left-handed children were taught to write with steel dip pens that needed to be dragged across the paper from left to right by right-handers, and were not capable of being pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains.\\" The National Geographic data also show significant variation in rates of left-handedness by U.S. state, with higher rates in the Northeast and lower rates in the middle of the country. Again, these differences may largely be explained by genetics. If certain families in certain areas are more likely to pass on left-handedness traits than others, you'd expect to see higher rates of left-handedness in those areas. Other than the occasional joke or stupid comment, you might think that Victorian-era attitudes toward left-handedness are a relic of the past. But the Oklahoma case makes clear that these attitudes survive, at least on some level. ||||| An Oklahoma teacher is forcing a 4-year-old boy who is left-handed to write with his other hand because she believes lefties are \\"evil,\\" the child's furious mother claims.

But fewer people realize that early in his career, Ruth was also one of the game’s élite pitchers. Between 1915 and 1919, he won 85 games (plus three World Series contests) while notching an ERA of 2.02, before the Boston Red Sox decided he’d be more valuable at the plate. But while Ruth is baseball’s most decorated left-handed player, he’s hardly the only Hall of Fame southpaw. It’s almost impossible for lefties to thrive in certain positions — including catcher, shortstop, second and third base — because they are required to throw awkwardly across their bodies to make plays in the field. But southpaws have distinct advantages on the diamond. Lefty Grove, Sandy Koufax, Warren Spahn and Steve Carlton are among the left-handed pitchers who have frustrated hitters. Lefty batters also do better at the plate: they do better against right-handed pitchers and stand a precious step or two closer to first base, advantages that sluggers from Ty Cobb and Stan Musial to Ted Williams and Barry Bonds have clearly used to their benefit. |||||Summary:","completion":"A 4-year-old boy named Zayde from Okemah, Oklahoma, was allegedly forced to write with his right hand by his pre-kindergarten teacher despite being naturally left-handed. The teacher sent a note home with Zayde that discussed how being left-handed is associated with evil and the devil. Zayde's mother, Alisha Sands, kept her son at home after becoming embroiled in the dispute with the teacher. She brought the issue to the attention of the school superintendent but received no satisfactory response to her complaint. Historically, left-handedness was viewed negatively, with people in the late Victorian era being stigmatized for their left-handedness. The situation improved over time, but cases like Zayde's demonstrate that negative attitudes towards left-handed individuals still persist. Roughly 10% of people are left-handed, with scientists agreeing that there is a strong genetic component to being left- or right-handed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Ohio Former Mahoning Valley Congressman Jim Traficant dies at age 73 The fiery Democrat from Youngstown was injured Tuesday on his farm after the tractor he was riding tipped over by WKSU's KABIR BHATIA Reporter Kabir Bhatia Jim Traficant represented himself during trials in 1983 and 2002, winning the first time but going to prison for 7 years the second Courtesy of C-SPAN In The Region: A family spokeswoman has confirmed that former Ohio Congressman Jim Traficant has died at age 73. Traficant was working on his farm Tuesday when his tractor flipped over, and he’s been unconscious and in the hospital ever since. The fiery Democrat represented Youngstown for 17 years before being convicted of bribery and racketeering in 2002. But he was popular enough locally to get 15 percent of the vote when he ran for re-election from prison. He lost to his former aide, Tim Ryan. “People called and they'd need help with a veteran's benefit [or] social security. He was in alcohol and drug rehab work for a long, long time. So I think those people who have those personal experiences with him will have a much different take than the national persona.” Traficant was released from prison in 2009, and unsuccessfully ran for Congress again the next year. He was also known for his fashion sense, which included bell bottoms, cowboy boots and hair that he himself said looked like it had been styled by a weed-wacker. His 2002 conviction came for accepting kickbacks and having staffers work on his farm. But he remained popular in the Mahoning Valley with people like Artha Mitchell. “I think he made some mistakes and apparently they caught up with him. But he's a human being. He's somebody's husband. He's somebody's father. I'm not here to judge.” Traficant was also known for championing autoworker John Demjanjuk, who was convicted by Israel of being notorious Nazi guard Ivan the Terrible. The conviction was set aside in 1993. ||||| Ohio's James Traficant Dies, Days After Accident On Farm Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images Former Rep.

Traficant's family had been fearing for his life since earlier this week, when he was critically injured in a tractor accident. Traficant's death comes years after he attempted a political comeback, filing to run for his old seat in 2010 as an independent in Ohio's 17th District. He had been kicked out of Congress in July of 2002, after being convicted on charges that included racketeering, bribery and tax evasion. \\"A spokeswoman for the family of James A.

(Associated Press) Traficant was seriously injured Tuesday after a vintage tractor flipped over on him as he tried to park it inside a barn on the family farm near Youngstown. He died four days later in a Youngstown hospital, said Dave Betras, chairman of the Mahoning County Democratic Party. The Democrat's expulsion from Congress in 2002 came three months after a federal jury in Cleveland convicted him. Prosecutors said he used his office to extract bribes from businesspeople and coerced staffers to work on his farm and his house boat on the Potomac River in Washington. He also was charged with witness tampering, destroying evidence and filing false tax returns. He spent seven years in prison. Traficant's notoriety was rivaled only by his eccentricity. He loved to play the buffoon during his 17 years in Congress. He got plenty of notice within the staid, buttoned-down Capitol and airtime on C-SPAN for his messy mop of hair — revealed to be a wig when he went to prison — his typical wardrobe of cowboy boots, denim or polyester suits, and his bombastic speaking style. His made-for-TV rants on the House floor invariably ended with the signoff \\"Beam me up,\\" which Traficant borrowed from \\"Star Trek\\" to show his disgust or bemusement at whatever he found particularly outrageous. \\"Mr. Traficant was a complex man,\\" Betras said. \\"He gave voice to the frustrations and anxieties of the common man. The public felt he was one of them and because of that connection, they supported him in good times and in bad. He was a larger than life character who will long be remembered.\\" Traficant was born May 8, 1941, in Youngstown and was a quarterback for the University of Pittsburgh, where he played with future NFL coaches Mike Ditka and Marty Schottenheimer. He worked as a drug counselor for 10 years before running for Mahoning County sheriff at a colleague's suggestion. He endeared himself to voters in the early 1980s by defying the courts and going to jail for three nights rather than foreclose on the homes of workers laid off from the city's dying steel industry. The antagonism between Traficant and federal law enforcement authorities lasted throughout his public career, with Traficant trumpeting it as proof that he was on the side of \\"the little guy\\" against powerful government interests. He faced his first federal bribery and corruption trial in 1983, when he was Mahoning County sheriff. Prosecutors accused Traficant of taking bribes to protect mobsters' criminal activity. He defended himself in court, although he was not a lawyer, and won. He argued that he was conducting a one-person sting. He was elected to Congress the following year and was easily re-elected eight times. He championed \\"Buy American\\" requirements on virtually every spending bill and prided himself on landing federal grants for hometown prospects, including highways, a sports arena and Youngstown's airport. Yet he often exasperated fellow Democrats by breaking ranks, such as his decision to vote for Republican Dennis Hastert as speaker and his differences with President Bill Clinton on trade and other issues. He denounced Justice Department tactics and belittled Clinton's attorney general, Janet Reno, as a good prospect to run for governor of Beijing. In 2000, as he geared up for re-election, Traficant was indicted in a grand jury investigation that targeted corruption and organized crime in the Youngstown area and led to the convictions of scores of people, including judges, a prosecutor and a sheriff. But Traficant was the biggest prize, and he was not as lucky in his second trial as in his first. He claimed the government had tried to frame him because of his criticism of the FBI, CIA and Internal Revenue Service. During the two-month trial, he did a curbside interview on live network TV outside the courthouse each morning and then went inside to challenge U.S. District Judge Lesley Brooks Wells, who tried to dissuade Traficant from representing himself. He often slumped alone at the defense table preparing handwritten motions as a team of prosecutors and investigators pressed the government's case under the eye of Justice Department attorneys. He was expelled from Congress in a 420-1 vote on July 24, 2002, three months after being convicted on 10 corruption-related counts. He could have avoided the indignity of expulsion by choosing to resign, but he remained defiant to the end. \\"I'm prepared to lose everything. I'm prepared to go to jail,\\" Traficant told colleagues as they debated his political fate. \\"You go ahead and expel me.\\" Six days later, at his sentencing, he abruptly fired his attorney. \\"Take your things and move,\\" he told the lawyer, who then switched seats with Traficant. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and led from the federal courtroom in handcuffs. Traficant called life in prison \\"tough.\\" \\"Most political figures go to some camps in country clubs,\\" he said. \\"I didn't.\\" His case over, Traficant ran for re-election from prison as an independent in 2002 and lost to former aide Tim Ryan. Traficant got 15 percent of the vote in a three-way race. He was released from prison in September 2009 and the following year ran for the Youngstown-area congressional seat as an independent. He received 16 percent of the vote, again losing to Tim Ryan, and then faded from the spotlight. From then on, he lived a quiet life on his farm, doting on his grandchildren. The barn where his tractor tipped over played a key role in his criminal case. A Youngstown businessman had the barn built for Traficant in return for a favor. The businessman later billed Traficant for the full construction cost after the congressman continued asking for favors. Traficant ended up paying him far less than what the barn was worth, and the businessman testified against him. ___ Biographical material in this report was written by former AP staffer Thomas J.

A:","completion":"Yes, based on the information you have provided, the correct answer to the question \\"which are required for animal survival?\\" would be \\"hydrogen and oxygen.\\" However, it is important to understand the context and the broader implications of these elements in the survival and functioning of animal life. Hydrogen and oxygen, in the form of water (H2O), are essential to the survival of animal life on Earth. Water is vital for various physiological processes, and animals need a constant intake of it to maintain optimum health. Here, we can break down the significance of both hydrogen and oxygen for animal survival. Hydrogen, as a constituting element of water, plays a primary role in the formation and function of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the molecular unit of energy used by cells to power life processes. In addition, hydrogen ions (protons) are involved in many cellular enzymatic reactions. Hydrogen is also part of many organic compounds, including carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, which are essential building blocks of life. Oxygen, on the other hand, is necessary for animal life for several reasons: 1. Cellular respiration: Oxygen is a key component of cellular respiration, which is the process by which energy is generated at the cellular level. In this process, cells use oxygen to convert glucose and other nutrients into ATP, the main molecule for intracellular energy storage and transfer. 2. Oxidative phosphorylation: Oxygen acts as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, a sequence of biochemical reactions within the mitochondria of cells. By accepting these electrons, oxygen allows the process of oxidative phosphorylation to continue and generate ATP, the energy currency of living organisms. 3. Oxygen-carrying molecules: In animals, specialized molecules like hemoglobin (in vertebrates) and hemocyanin (in some invertebrates) bind to oxygen and transport it through the circulatory system. These molecules deliver oxygen to tissues and organs, allowing aerobic respiration to take place efficiently. Though hydrogen and oxygen are necessary, there are other essential elements and molecules for animal survival. These include carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and various trace elements, as well as organic molecules like carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Furthermore, animals require a stable environment, appropriate habitats, and adequate nutrition to survive. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question \\"which are required for animal survival?\\" is indeed \\"hydrogen and oxygen,\\" given the context you provided. However, this answer only encompasses one aspect of animal survival that focuses on water intake and the importance of hydrogen and oxygen in physiological processes.

A new study has found many of us have programmes which we regularly sit down to enjoy - but prefer to keep our guilty pleasure to ourselves. The latest adventures of Joey Essex, Sam Faiers and Lucy Mecklenburgh on TOWIE came top of the pile, while Jeremy Kyle’s show and The Great British Bake Off came second and third respectively in the poll. The Only Way really IS Essex! A new study has revealed that Brits love watching TOWIE but hate to admit it. The study revealed that while many may be quick to insist they are avid viewers of high-brow programmes like Newsnight, it's actually the antics of the TOWIE cast and lure of conflict and emotional drama of Jeremy Kyle that have viewers hooked. Other guilty pleasures include tea-time drama Hollyoaks and Strictly Come Dancing. Brits are also keeping their love of Storage Hunters secured tightly as the show where treasure seekers bid on garages full of junk made the top ten. The report found that the average TV viewer clocks up over 25 hours of television in an average week - more than 1,266 hours a year - which may explain why over a third said they love nothing more than a night in front of the box. Guilty pleasures: Jeremy Kyle's show and The Great British Bake Off came second and third respectively in the poll of our favourite TV shows that we hate admitting to watching. The study also saw Downton Abbey voted the most popular programme in recent times by the average British viewer. Dr Helen Wheatley of the University of Warwick said: 'This report shows the versatility of TV as a medium. 'The research shows that people continue to turn to television for entertainment, to learn new things, to become absorbed in the twisting plot lines of a television drama, but also to indulge in \\"guilty pleasures\\". 'It is clear that whilst viewers simultaneously find a wide range of programmes fascinating and compelling, they also worry about what their viewing habits say about them.'

Please answer the following question: Information: - Upstate New York is the portion of the American state of New York lying north of New York City. The region includes most of the state of New York, excluding New York City and its environs, as well as Long Island, though the precise boundary is debated. Upstate New York includes the major cities of Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, and Syracuse. - Raquette Lake is the source of the Raquette River in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. It is near the community of Raquette Lake, New York. The lake has 99 miles (160 km) of shoreline with pines and mountains bordering the lake. It is located in the towns of Long Lake and Arietta, both in Hamilton County. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - An inholding is privately owned land inside the boundary of a national park, national forest, state park, or similar publicly owned, protected area. In-holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property. In the United States, the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States. When the park system was formed, many of these now-called \\"in-holdings\\" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed. Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the United States Congress to acquire private residences especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other federal lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas. - The Adirondack Park is a part of New York's Forest Preserve in Upstate New York, United States. The park's boundary corresponds to the Adirondack Mountains. Unlike most preserves, about 52 per cent of the land is privately owned inholdings heavily regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency. This area contains 102 towns and villages, as well as numerous farms, businesses, and an active timber harvesting industry. The year-round population is 132,000, with 200,000 seasonal residents. The inclusion of human communities makes the park one of the great experiments in conservation in the industrialized world. - The lake's popularity derives from its remoteness, climate and beauty, as well as its notoriety as the location of the murder of Grace Brown in 1906. Alleged ghost sightings and subsequent media attention have added to the allure. - The Adirondack Mountains form a massif in the northeast of Upstate New York in the United States. Its boundaries correspond to the boundaries of Adirondack Park. The mountains form a roughly circular dome, about in diameter and about high. The current relief owes much to glaciation. - The Pigeon Lake Wilderness Area , an Adirondack Park unit of the forest preserve , lies in the town of Webb , Herkimer County , and the towns of Long Lake and Inlet in Hamilton County . It is bounded on the north by Stillwater Reservoir and large blocks of private land in the vicinity of Rose Pond , Shingle Shanty Pond and Upper Sister Lake ; on the east by a private road from Brandreth Lake to North Point and by Raquette Lake ; on the south by private lands along the Uncas Road ; and on the west by the Big Moose Road , private lands near Big Moose Lake , Thirsty Pond , Twitchell Lake , Razorback Pond , and the Remsen to Lake Placid railroad tracks . The terrain consists of low , rolling hills , with the exception of West Mountain near the eastern boundary . There are many brook trout ponds and streams and a considerable expanse of swampland along the courses of Sucker Brook and Beaver Brook . The forest cover runs to mature or near - mature mixed softwoods and hardwoods , with some dense spruce - balsam types near the summit of West Mountain and in the swamplands . Old - growth white pine can be found in the vicinity of Pigeon Lake and a few other places . It is easily accessible to the public from the south , southeast and southwest , but to a lesser extent from the west and north because of posted private lands . The chief attractions for the public are the trout ponds , which entice fishermen as well as campers who frequent scenic spots around Cascade Lake , Queer Lake , Constable Pond , Pigeon Lake and Gull Lake . It is also a popular area for hunters during the big game season . The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation maintains Brown Tract Pond Campground on the southeast perimeter . Motorboats are now banned from operating on Brown Tract Ponds to provide a more compatible situation for canoes and other non-motorized boats utilized by the campers . - Raquette Lake is a hamlet in the Town of Long Lake in Hamilton County, New York, United States. - Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity. It may also be defined as: \\"The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planetthose last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.\\" - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.

Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - A wilderness area is a region where the land is in a natural state; where impacts from human activities are minimalthat is, as a wilderness.

Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - The Adirondack Park Agency (APA) was created in 1971 by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller as a governmental agency that performs long-range planning for the future of the Adirondack Park.

Visa holders from the affected nations have been scrambling to get flights to the US, fearing they have a slim window to enter America. Mr Trump's ban last week led to mass protests and confusion at US airports. There were further demonstrations on Saturday in Washington, Miami and other US cities as well as in a number of European capitals. Thousands of people turned out in London, with smaller protests in Paris, Berlin, Stockholm and Barcelona. Trump supporters staged some counter-protests in the US. Some 60,000 visas have been revoked since Mr Trump's executive order was issued. But Judge James Robart's temporary restraining order halted it nationwide with immediate effect. He found that legal challenges launched by two states, Washington and Minnesota, were likely to succeed. State lawyers had argued that the ban was unconstitutional because it denied people with valid entry documents the right to travel without due process. It also violated freedom of religion rights by appearing to target Muslims, they said. Mr Trump called Judge Robart's ruling \\"ridiculous\\", vowing to restore the ban. The ban envisages a 90-day visa suspension for anyone arriving from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The directive also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Programme for 120 days, and places an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. The appeal against the suspension was formally filed by the US Department of Justice on Saturday. Mr Trump is named as one of the appellants in his capacity as president, along with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The administration argues that the travel ban is designed to protect the US, and it is seeking an emergency stay that would restore the restrictions. Meanwhile, the US president took to Twitter to rage against Judge Robart, who has served on the federal bench since 2004 after nomination by President George W Bush. \\"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\\" he wrote. Mr Trump later added in another tweet: \\"What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?\\" The president later predicted that the appeal would succeed. \\"We'll win. For the safety of the country, we'll win,\\" he told reporters. On Friday evening a federal court judge in Seattle suspended the Trump administration's controversial immigration executive order. On Saturday Donald Trump tweeted his disapproval. And tweeted, and tweeted. He attacked the \\"so-called judge\\" who issued the ruling, prompting criticism that he was undermining a co-equal branch of government. He warned that \\"many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country\\". And he wondered why lawyers weren't \\"looking at and using\\" the decision of a federal court in Boston that did not suspend the entire order. On this last point, Mr Trump misunderstands how the US legal system works. No-one - not even a president - gets to pick and choose which court rulings to listen to and which to ignore. Rather, appellate courts - all the way to the US Supreme Court - are charged with reviewing the validity of judicial decisions and resolving any conflicts. Mr Trump's government lawyers are already setting that process in motion by appealing against the Seattle judge's decision. For now, the fate of Mr Trump's immigration order rests in the hands of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals - no matter how many times the president tweets. The state department has said it is reversing visa cancellations and US homeland security employees have been told by their department to comply with the ruling. Customs officials told airlines that they could resume boarding banned travellers. Qatar Airways, Air France, Etihad Airways, Lufthansa and others said they would do so. Travellers from the affected countries have been trying to use the window of opportunity by boarding US-bound flights on Saturday. Green Card holder Ammar Alnajjar, a Yemeni national, had to cut short a planned three-month visit to his fiancee in Turkey. He told the Associated Press he had paid 1,000 (Â£800) to return immediately. But there were also reports that a number of travellers were not allowed to fly to America. In Djibouti, east Africa, immigrants from all seven countries on the list were not allowed to fly, an immigration attorney was quoted as saying by AP. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"This story is about President Trump's recent decision to stop people from certain countries from coming to America. A judge said that this is not allowed, so now some people from these countries are trying to come to America quickly before anything changes.

In recent years, the economy has suffered because of depressed international demand for nickel, due to the ongoing financial crisis of 2007–2008. Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition to nickel, the substantial financial support from France and tourism are keys to the health of the economy. In the 2000s, large additions were made to nickel mining capacity. The Goro, New Caledonia is expected to be one of the largest nickel producing plants on Earth. When full-scale production begins in 2013 this plant will produce an estimated 20% of the global nickel supply.

Answer the above question based on the context below: MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea. When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice. Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya. The answer to this question is:","completion":"MSgt Mike Takashima is the person who was a paratrooper during World War II in the given context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Four Christmases Movie plot: Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) are an upscale San Francisco couple. Having both come from dysfunctional families, with divorced parents and siblings with out-of-control kids, the two disdain the idea of getting married or having kids. In an effort to avoid their families at Christmas, the two go on vacation abroad while pretending to be doing charity work there. The third Christmas of their relationship, Brad and Kate are trapped at San Francisco International Airport by a fog bank that cancels every outbound flight, and interviewed by a news crew, alerting their families to the fact they're stuck at home for the holidays.

They first visit Brad's father (Robert Duvall), then Kate's mother (Mary Steenburgen), then Brad's mother (Sissy Spacek) and, finally, Kate's father (Jon Voight), thereby celebrating four Christmases in one day. As they brace themselves for a marathon of homecomings, Brad and Kate expect the worst, but are nevertheless unable to prepare themselves enough for what they get. As the day progresses, each discover a new secret about their partner that they had previously been too embarrassed to share, namely that Brad's real name is \\"Orlando\\", and Kate has a fear of inflatable castles, stemming from being ostracized as a child, and these discoveries put an intense strain on their relationship. While Brad counts down the minutes to freedom, Kate finds herself looking at the lives of Brad's and her own siblings and comes to realize that she does want a marriage and children of her own, the prospect of which frightens Brad when she mentions it to him. Eventually, in the final visit of the day, at Kate's father's house, Kate asks Brad to let her spend the visit on her own and claims to her family that they had split up. Meanwhile, Brad spends some time at his own father's house with just his father and realises that he wants a marriage and children, and that he loves Kate way too...

The film has become a political point of controversy between left-wing filmmakers who think the movie is propaganda and conservative politicians dedicated to deafening the memory of slain Navy SEAL Chris Kyle whose memoir inspired the film. The Academy Award-nominated movie stars Bradley Cooper as real-life Navy SEAL Kyle, who became the deadliest sniper in U.S. history for making more than 150 kills. He was tragically killed just a few years after leaving the military, allegedly by a fellow soldier struggling with PTSD. Michael Moore was the first to speak out against the film on Twitter last week by calling snipers 'cowards'. He has continued to rant about both the film and the Iraq War for the past two weeks while American Sniper has set box-office records. Meanwhile, conservatives like Sarah Palin have been calling Moore out for his 'disrespect' of U.S.troops.

A U.S. Marine is presumed lost at sea after bailing out from a MV-22 Osprey plane after it lost power over the Persian Gulf on Wednesday, the U.S. Navy announced today. The tilt-rotor aircraft - which can take off and land like a helicopter, but fly like a fixed-wig plane - had just taken off from the amphibious assault ship U.S.S. Makin Island when it suddenly lost power. Two crew members bailed out, but the pilot stayed on board and was able to save the 70million aircraft and land it again on the deck of the ship. Numerous ships from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Navy's Fifth Fleet scoured the area in search of the crew members. An MV-22 Osprey plane (like the one pictured right) lost power while taking off from the U.S.S. Makin Island assault ship (pictured) on Wednesday (stock image) One Marine was rescued and is recovering aboard a Navy ship. The other was not found. The service member has not been identified. The Makin Island - which can carry Harrier jets, an assortment of helicopters, up to 22 Osprey planes and nearly 2,000 Marines - is currently stationed in Bahrain to support military operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Bahrain is home to the Navy's Fifth Fleet. The San Diego-based warship left for the Middle East on July 25. It carried elements of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which is also based in San Diego. The MV-22 (like the one pictured here) is a title-rotor aircraft capable of taking off and landing like a helicopter, but can fly like an airplane. The V-22 is a small, fast transport plane that is able to fly and maneuver like an airplane, but can take off and land on ship decks and makeshift landing pads like a helicopter. Each plane can carry up to 36 troops or a small, specially designed fighting Growler vehicle. Its 35billion development, long delayed and far over-budget, came at the cost of several deadly crashes. More recently, though, the aircraft has had a slightly better record. Two crashes in 2012, however, raised questions. One on a training exercise in Morocco killed two Marines. In another, the aircraft flipped over at a Florida air base and injured all five aboard.

By about week two we both had an awakening. Something about being exact opposites and together 24/7. We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other.

Here is a news article: The most revealing moment of Stephen Colbert’s interview with Michael Wolff came near its end, when the comedian asked the Fire and Fury author to name one thing, in the 18 months he spent reporting on the Trump administration from the White House, that gave him cause for optimism. In response, Wolff perform an exaggerated roll of the eyes, accompanied by a groan. “People gotta go to sleep after this,” the Late Show host reminded, but Wolff’s deadpan stare into the camera made perfectly clear that he had no interest in soothing Colbert’s viewers, nor the millions of Americans who’d devored Fire and Fury over the weekend. “Nothing,” Wolff finally said. “Nothing. This is alarming in every way.” CBS The interview took place on Monday night, after a weekend in which President Trump assailed Wolff on Twitter, calling him a “total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book.” He then dispatched emissaries to the Sunday talk shows, where they sought to counter Wolff’s most damaging assertions, in particular those involving the president’s mental acuity. Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now Monday night found Wolff playing defense as well, as the Republican attacks on his reputation were bolstered by disapproval — often voiced on Twitter – from Wolff’s fellow journalists. Since the book went on sale on Friday, a number of small errors have been unearthed. More grave have been charges that while Wolff wants to claim the authority of a journalist, he freely resorts to novelistic flights of imagination when it suits his narrative. And although Colbert is a daily critic of Trump, and a vicious one at that, he did not fawn over Wolff. “I’m deeply conflicted when I read this,” he admitted near the beginning of the interview. “How much of it should I believe?” “You should believe all of it,” Wolff countered. “That’s the alarming thing. That this is all true.” But there remains the troubling possibility that Wolff resorted to excessive dramatization of events in order to appeal to a liberal audience already terrified of Trump. “Does this comport with what you already know?” Wolff wondered to Colbert. Indeed, the book paints a portrait of Trump that had become prevalent: that of a dissengaged, self-obsessed chief executive. But Wolff is more creative with his brush than other journalists. Moreover, the opacity of his sourcing makes it difficult to confirm his version of events. Colbert pressed Wolff on more than one occassion to produce the recordings he claims to have made during his year-and-a-half of reporting from the White House. Wolff declined to do so, though without offering a compelling reason why. “I’m in the writing business,” he said. The exchange was especially ironic because it was Colbert who invented the concept of truthiness — the slightly askew version of reality that is the staple of cable news and, according to some, marks Wolff’s own reporting. Wolff’s interview with Colbert marked six days of almost unimaginable publicity for Wolff. An excerpt from his book had been published in The Guardian on Wednesday, with others quickly following. The threat of a potential lawsuit by Trump lead Wolff’s publisher, Henry Holt & Co., to move up the book’s release date by several days to last Friday. Trump’s tweets about Fire and Fury appear to have only launched the book into the stratosphere, where few political memoirs can ever hope to orbit. Trump “asked for my media schedule today,” Wolff informed Colbert. “So that might mean that all he’s done today is watched me on television,” Wolff said, a statement made with great mockery and even greater glee. ||||| Via WashPost's @ MarkBerman: This page in Wolff's book has 3 errors. @ HilaryRosen's name is misspelled.

Bannon, uncharacteristically, tried to de-escalate his ill-timed feud with Trump, issuing a public partial apology Sunday for his comments about Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr., but inside the White House the statement was \\"seen as too little, too late for an operative unaware of the self-inflicted damage his hubris could cause,\\" Politico says, and \\"it did nothing to quell Trump's rage at his former chief strategist or the anger of Bannon's former West Wing colleagues.\\" Trump's tweets about his intelligence notwithstanding, the White House strategy for parrying questions about Trump's mental fitness has focused on \\"umbrage and indignation,\\" attacking anybody who raises the question, the Post says. \\"The White House perspective is outrage and disgust that people who do not know this president or understand the true depth of his intellectual capabilities would be so filled with hate they would resort to something so far outside the realm of reality or decency,\\" Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders emailed the Post.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Don't initiate any contact with your ex, including phone calls, texts, emails, messages on social media, and in-person conversations. If he tries to initiate contact with you, don't respond. Depending on the situation, you may want to respond to a text or email by simply telling your ex that you are not interested in talking to him. If he is being completely unreasonable, don't bother responding. If you are getting threatening messages from your ex or he is stalking you, report the behavior to the police immediately. You may be able to get a restraining order to keep him from contacting you or coming near you. If your ex-boyfriend will not stop calling, texting, or emailing you, you can block his number and email address. If he is very persistent and starts calling you from other people's phones or emailing you from different addresses, you might want to consider changing your phone number and/or email address. Most social media sites allow multiple options for blocking or ignoring a person. If you want to prevent your ex-boyfriend from viewing your profile and you want him to get the message that you don't want any contact with him, block him. If you don't want to take it to that extreme, but you also don't want to see any updates from your ex, ignore or unfollow him. If possible, avoid places where you know you are likely to run into your ex. If this is not possible, just keep walking when you see him instead of stopping to talk. If you share mutual friends, have classes together, or work together, you might have no choice but to spend some time in the same room with your ex. It might be hard at first, but do your best to interact with everyone else in the room normally, and avoid talking to your ex as much as possible. Don't go overboard by literally pretending not to see him. This will probably make him think that you're uncomfortable being around him, which is not what you want. Instead, address him as you would a stranger. Keep your interactions brief and avoid body language that suggests intimacy, like direct eye contact. If you're with a group of people, make an effort to talk to other people in the group instead of to your ex-boyfriend. If your ex starts talking to you, respond politely, but very briefly, so he will know you're not interested in talking. For example, if he says, \\"That math test was really hard. How do you think you did,\\" just say, \\"Fine,\\" and show no interest in continuing the conversation. If your ex-boyfriend tries to use other people to give you messages, respond according to the situation. If the messenger is your friend, just tell him that you're not interested in hearing what your ex has to say and you hope that he won't let that get in the way of your friendship. If the messenger is not your friend and has been sent by your ex to say something mean to you, just ignore him. If you're like most people, your boyfriend was probably the first person you went to for consolation when something bad happened to you, and also the first person you told when something exciting happened. This can make it very hard to let go of your ex because you may still feel like contacting him in these situations. Instead, try turning to a friend, a sibling, or a parent. It might be tempting to replace your ex with a new boyfriend, but don't do this unless you're really ready to commit yourself to a new relationship. If you do feel ready, then go ahead and date new people. It will be much easier to ignore your ex-boyfriend if you really are occupied with other things. Start doing more things with your friends, join a club, or take up a new hobby to get your mind off your ex and make ignoring him completely natural. If you and your ex-boyfriend are in the same social circles, it will help if he sees you looking happy and enjoying life without him. This will make him feel like none of the mean things he's been doing are having any effect on you. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short version of a longer story or explanation.

Seven others were so badly damaged that their owners had to leave them, and fifteen others had broken windows or broken roofs. One person was killed, several were badly hurt and taken to the hospital, and a number of other people received light hurt. In total, over two hundred people were homeless. Mr Tan said that the storm began early in the morning and lasted for over an hour. \\"I was eating with my wife and children when we heard a loud noise,\\" he said. \\"Several minutes later, our house fell down on top of us. We tried our best to climb out but then I saw that one of my children was missing.

Pick from: A. yes B. it is not possible to tell C. no","completion":"C. no Given the premise \\"Today it is the site of bullfights,\\" we can infer that the location mentioned is currently being used for bullfights. This information directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"It is not used for anything these days.\\" Since the location is being used for bullfighting events, it cannot be considered unused or abandoned. The premise tells us that the location has a specific purpose and function in the present, which is to host bullfights. This demonstrates that it has an active role and is being utilized by people who either organize or attend these events. In this case, the site is far from being unused or inactive, as suggested by the hypothesis. It is also essential to consider the cultural and historical significance of bullfighting in certain regions, particularly in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of Latin America. Bullfighting events often serve as a symbol of tradition, and the arenas or sites where they take place can be considered important landmarks that hold significant relevance for both locals and tourists. Therefore, based on the provided information, the answer is \\"C. no\\" because the premise clearly indicates that the location is being used for bullfights, which refutes the hypothesis that it is \\"not used for anything these days.\\" The fact that it is an active site of bullfighting events demonstrates that the location has a significant role and purpose in the present, contrary to what the hypothesis suggests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic .","completion":"The sentiment of the given movie review sentence appears to be mostly negative, with some mixed feelings. The analysis of this sentiment can be broken down as follows: 1. \\"as convincing as any other arnie musclefest\\" - This part of the sentence seems to be mildly positive or neutral, depending on the reader's stance on Arnold Schwarzenegger's (Arnie) action films. The reviewer is stating that this movie is on par with other films in the \\"musclefest\\" genre. If the reader enjoys such films, they might find this statement positive or neutral. If they don't appreciate these types of films, they may consider it negative. 2. \\"but has a little too much resonance with real world events\\" - The reviewer seems to be expressing a negative sentiment here, as they are criticizing the movie for being too closely related to real-world events. This could mean the movie may not provide escapism or entertainment, but instead, it may feel like a reminder of the harsh realities that the audience might want to forget while watching a film. 3. \\"ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic\\" - This part of the sentence clearly demonstrates a negative sentiment. The reviewer seems to be disappointed with the movie's simplicity and even goes as far as to call it \\"insulting.\\" The use of the word \\"insulting\\" shows strong disapproval, suggesting that the movie might not have met the reviewer's expectations in terms of depth or complexity. Overall, the sentiment of this movie review sentence leans towards negative. The reviewer appears to be dissatisfied with the film's connection to real-world events and its simplicity. While there is a slight positive or neutral sentiment based on the comparison to other \\"arnie musclefest\\" films, it does not outweigh the negative aspects highlighted in the review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Firefighters worked to protect hogs in one building as a fire burned through another, killing over 4,000 baby pigs at a North Carolina farm. Emergency responders arrived at 700-acre Deerfield Farms in Eagle Springs around 11 p.m. Wednesday to find the nursery already in flames. Aberdeen Times reports that 10 emergency teams were on the scene working to put out the blaze as well as keep it from spreading to other structures or setting nearby propane tanks on fire. Factory: The USDA categorizes farm structures with more than 1,000 animals as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs (file photo) Water needed to be shuttled onto the farm down the mile of dirt road where the farm is located because there was no sufficient water source on the farm itself. Though fire officials said the fire was eventually controlled, about 4,200 pigs housed in the nursery were killed. The pigs ranged from 14 to 45 pounds.The animals are not considered hogs until they reach about 120 pounds and are ready to be butchered at about 220 pounds. 'It smelled bad,' said Eagle Springs Fire Department Chief Marshall Nall. 'It didn't smell like what you're going to eat at a restaurant.' 'When you have animals confined indoors they're not able to escape from problems like this,' said Gene Baur, president of Farm Sanctuary, a non-profit that opposes factory farming.

Sentence 2: The chapel was destroyed in 1943 during a World War 2 bombing raid. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Based on the information provided in both sentences, it appears that there might be a contradiction or discrepancy in the two statements. However, the truth of both sentences ultimately depends on the source and the timeline in which the events took place. According to the first sentence, Goya's greatest frescoes were found remarkably preserved in an 18th-century chapel located between railway yards and a river. If this sentence is true, it makes a solid claim about the presence of Goya's artwork on the chapel's cupola. This would mean that, at least at the time of the sentence's claim, the chapel (and consequently, the frescoes) was still standing and intact. On the other hand, the second sentence states that the chapel was destroyed during a bombing raid in 1943, which occurred during World War 2. If this sentence is true, it means that the chapel cannot be in existence after 1943. It is essential to consider the temporal context in which both sentences were written. If the first sentence were written on or before 1943, it's possible that the chapel still had the frescoes at that time. In that case, the second sentence's claim could also be true, meaning that at some point after the first sentence had been written (and before 1943), the bombings destroyed the chapel. However, if the first sentence were written after 1943, while the second sentence is true (based on historical records or evidence), there would be a clear contradiction in the information provided. It is also possible that the information in either sentence is not accurate, in which case determining the truth of either statement would require additional evidence and context from reliable sources. In conclusion, the truth of both sentences cannot be determined solely based on the information provided.

Ella is a girl who is better known as Cinderella (Sarah Michelle Gellar). She lives as a servant to her step family, dreams of the Prince (Patrick Warburton) who will sweep her off her feet. Her best friend at the palace is Rick (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), the palace dishwasher. Rick takes it upon himself to deliver the invitations to the royal ball to Ella. Ella sees Rick only as a friend, but Rick secretly loves Ella, although he is too cool and proud to admit it. Rick can't really understand what Ella likes about the Prince. Rick's Three Amigos, the comic chefs (all voiced by Phil Proctor, Rob Paulsen and Tom Kenny) in the palace kitchen, believe that Rick has a bad case of \\"Prince envy\\". The Prince does everything by the book, and plans to meet his maiden at the ball. However, things don't go as planned at the ball. Thanks to the assistants, Ella's evil stepmother, Frieda (Sigourney Weaver) gains access to the Wizard's lair during the Prince's ball. She manages to chase off Munk and Mambo and tip the scales of good and evil, causing a series of fairy tales to go wrong and have unhappy endings, including Jack getting stepped on by the Giant (John DiMaggio) yet surviving, Rumpelstiltskin (Michael McShane) winning his bet with the miller's daughter (Jill Talley) and taking her baby, and the unseen demise of Little Red Riding Hood. She summons an army of Trolls, witches (Tress MacNeille and Jill Talley), three Big Bad Wolves (Jon Polito and Tom Kenny), the Giant (John DiMaggio), and...

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do some animals need to survive?\\" is \\"smell\\", given that some animals need smell to survive? A:","completion":"To determine if the answer \\"smell\\" is the right answer to the question \\"what do some animals need to survive?\\" let us analyze the question and its context step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking for a factor that some animals need in order to survive. Step 2: Consider the given answer The given answer is \\"smell.\\" Smell is a sense that helps various animals in different ways, such as finding food, detecting predators, or even communicating with other members of their species. Step 3: Evaluate the answer's relevance Smell does play an important role in the survival of certain animals. While some animals rely more on other senses (such as sight or hearing), it is true that some animals' survival depends significantly on their sense of smell. Step 4: Compare with other possible answers There are other factors that animals need for survival, such as food, water, air, and shelter. However, since the question specifically asks for \\"what do some animals need to survive?\\" and not \\"what do all animals need to survive?\\", the answer \\"smell\\" does address the question accurately. Conclusion: Considering that the question asks for a factor needed for survival by some animals, and that smell is indeed crucial for the survival of certain species, the answer \\"smell\\" is a correct answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mrs Merkel did not mention US President Donald Trump, who has vowed to erect a barrier across the Mexican border. She said history showed that migration pressures were resolved only when empires got on well with their neighbours. Mrs Merkel grew up in communist East Germany, behind the Iron Curtain. Addressing a panel discussion with Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto, she said: \\"Obviously the main reason for people leaving must be addressed on site first, which means that putting up walls and cutting oneself off will not solve the problem.\\" Mrs Merkel suggested the key to managing large-scale migration was to improve living standards and opportunities in affected areas. The German leader has sometimes faced criticism at home for welcoming more than a million refugees since 2015. In another counter to Mr Trump, Mrs Merkel backed Mexico's free trade position ahead of talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between Mexico, the US and Canada. Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised the agreement, and threatened to withdraw from it if he cannot renegotiate it in America's favour.

The reviewer further goes on to say that the book made them feel depressed and that reading should be for enjoyment. Instead, the reviewer recommends the Nancy Drew Files series, praising it for being better in their opinion. The customer states that this series is more enjoyable, and Nancy Drew appears more mature in these books.

Among the newcomers were two young men, one of handsome presence with a bold, frank face expression and manner; the other a ruffled, glum-faced person, heavily built and roughly dressed. The two were handcuffed together. As they passed down the aisle of the coach the only available seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman. Here the linked couple seated themselves. The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her face and a tender pink tingeing(,) her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard. \\"Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - The Allman Joys was an early band with Duane and Gregg Allman fronting.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause.

I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning.

Step 1: Analyze the statement The statement provided is: \\"Woman in red shirt and white cap rollerblading on gray surface.\\" This tells us about the woman's clothing and activity (rollerblading), but it does not mention anything about her motivation or intention for rollerblading. Step 2: Consider necessary conditions for the conclusion For the conclusion \\"The woman is practicing to enter a roller derby\\" to logically follow, the statement should provide information or evidence that supports this conclusion. For instance, if the statement mentioned that the woman was participating in roller derby training or that she was practicing specific roller derby skills, then the conclusion may logically follow. Step 3: Evaluate if the conclusion logically follows from the statement Given the information provided in the statement, there is no direct evidence to suggest that the woman is practicing to enter a roller derby.

Answer:","completion":"Joshua Grenier, born on July 16, 1979, in Manchester, New Hampshire, is a retired American soccer player known for his strong defensive skills as a central defender. Throughout his storied career, Grenier has played for a variety of clubs, both in the United States and internationally. Some of his most notable clubs include New England Revolution in Major League Soccer, FC St. Pauli in Germany's second division, 1. FC Kaiserslautern in Bundesliga, and his last team Tus Koblenz, also in the 2. Bundesliga. Grenier has a total of 52 caps, or appearances, for the United States national team. As a central defender, he was primarily tasked with providing a protective barrier to prevent the opposing team from scoring goals. Throughout his career, Grenier was known for his exceptional ability to read the game, making crucial tackles and interceptions to keep his team out of danger. Joshua Grenier has accumulated robust experience playing professionally from the late 1990s until his retirement in the late 2010s. His career spanned approximately two decades, during which he represented numerous clubs and left an indelible mark on the field of soccer. Grenier stands tall at 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm), a height that helped him dominate aerial duels, giving him a significant advantage in both defensive and offensive set-pieces. Before turning professional, Joshua Grenier spent his youth years playing for local club New Hampshire Classics, followed by the University of Maryland as part of their collegiate soccer team. It was during his time with these youth clubs that Grenier honed his skills, laying the foundation for his successful professional career. His youth career spanned the mid-1990s, from approximately 1994 to 1998. As previously mentioned, Joshua Grenier was born on July 16, 1979, in Manchester, New Hampshire. This birthplace provided him with the opportunity to develop his passion for soccer in his home country before branching out to play for clubs internationally. While exact statistics on Grenier's career goals may not be readily available, as a central defender, his primary focus rested on preventing the opposition from scoring rather than racking up goals himself. That being said, it is not uncommon for central defenders to occasionally find the back of the net, typically through headers during set-pieces like corners and free kicks. Given Grenier's height and aerial presence, it would not be surprising if he had managed to score a handful of goals during his remarkable career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which part of the factory is most similar to the nucleus of a living cell?. Answer:","completion":"The part of an automotive factory that is most similar to the nucleus of a living cell is the central control center or the management office. In order to understand the analogy between a living cell and a car factory, let's first look at the functions of the nucleus as well as the central control center or management office within a car factory: 1. The Nucleus in a Living Cell: The nucleus is considered as the 'control center' or the 'brain' of a eukaryotic cell (cells with a defined nucleus). It is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the cell's genetic material in the form of DNA. The primary functions of the nucleus are to store and protect this genetic information, regulate gene expression, and control the synthesis of proteins. - DNA Stores Genetic Information: DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes. Human cells, for example, typically have 46 chromosomes that store all the genetic information required for an organism's development, functioning, and reproduction. - Regulates Gene Expression: The nucleus is responsible for orchestrating which genes are expressed (active) and which are not (inactive), thereby controlling the production of various cellular components, including proteins. - Controls Protein Synthesis: The nucleus is also involved in the process of transcription, where the DNA code is transcribed into RNA. This RNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to be translated into proteins by ribosomes. 2. Central Control Center or Management Office in a Car Factory: The central control center or management office serves as the coordinating hub within an automotive factory that houses all the key personnel, such as managers, executives, and engineers. This office is responsible for overseeing the entire car production process, from design and planning to assembly and quality control. - Oversees Production: The management office manages all aspects of car manufacturing, including setting production schedules, supervising workers, and ensuring that the assembly line runs efficiently. - Designs and Plans: This department is responsible for designing new car models and creating the production plan in collaboration with different teams. The engineering department develops detailed specifications and blueprints for each aspect of the vehicle's assembly. - Quality Control: One goal of the control center is to maintain high quality throughout the production process. To achieve this, they implement quality control measures, monitor assembly line performance, and address any potential issues to ensure that the final product meets the company's standards. Based on these functions, the central control center or management office in a car factory is most similar to the nucleus of a living cell. Both the nucleus and the control center serve as the central hub that stores essential information, regulates various processes, and ensures the smooth and efficient functioning of the larger system, whether it is a living cell or a car factory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On Snapchat, if I block someone and they saved my messages, how can they still see the messages when they can't search for me? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choices: [1]. no. [2]. yes.","completion":"[1]. no. The two questions are not the same; they address two different aspects of being blocked on Snapchat, though both questions revolve around the topic. Let's discuss each query separately and more in-depth. 1. \\"If someone blocked me on Snapchat, can they see if I'm 'typing'?\\" When someone blocks you on Snapchat, it means they are doing so to prevent you from contacting them or seeing their snaps (either private ones or their stories). The \\"typing\\" feature is a real-time indication of when a user is about to send you a message. Once you are blocked, this person will no longer be able to see your snaps, stories, messages, and even your typing status. Snapchat places a barrier between you and the person who blocked you, eliminating interaction and communication within the app. In the same vein, you also won't be able to see the person who blocked you on Snapchat. You won't be able to see their snaps, stories, or if they are typing. The blocking feature essentially severs the connection between both parties within the app. 2. \\"On Snapchat, if I block someone and they saved my messages, how can they still see the messages when they can't search for me?\\" Once a person is blocked on Snapchat, they won't be able to view your profile or search for your username. However, if they had saved previous messages exchanged in a chat, they may still have access to those messages. This retained message feature is due to Snapchat's chat interface, designed to automatically delete chats after the receiver reads them or once they leave the chat screen. When someone saves a message by tapping on it, the message appears highlighted in gray in the chat. This action prevents the message from disappearing even after the receiver reads it or leaves the chat screen. Consequently, if a user had saved messages in a conversation with you before being blocked, they would still be able to view those saved messages, as they are locally stored on their device. However, despite being able to see saved messages, the person blocked will not be able to search your profile, send snaps or messages, see your stories, or interact with you on Snapchat in any other way. In conclusion, being blocked on Snapchat effectively eliminates communication between two users and minimizes visibility, but it does not have any impact on messages that have already been saved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Lenny McCourt's Family Exposes Alleged Police Negligence Leading to Tragic Death: A Catalogue of Failures (Video) The family of Lenny McCourt has recently brought to light a shocking revelation regarding his death, which they believe resulted from systematic negligence on the part of responding police officers. To support their claims, they have released startling CCTV footage, which captures the tragic moments leading up to his death. This critical evidence has led to further inquiries, with the police watchdog acknowledging the presence of a \\"catalogue of failures\\" surrounding the events leading to McCourt's untimely passing. Lenny McCourt, who was suffering from a health condition at the time, had his life taken in a tragic turn of events amidst his interaction with police officers. His grieving family is now demanding justice for their beloved, and they've presented CCTV footage as undeniable evidence of the negligence that they allege has cost them more than just emotional turmoil. The CCTV footage portrays a dire scene in which Lenny McCourt was left helpless and unresponsive as police officers disregarded the severity of his condition. With the damning images made public, the McCourt family hopes to draw attention to the harsh reality of police misconduct, an issue that impacts countless families worldwide. By exposing these frailties within the system, they aim to instigate change and prevent future instances of life-shattering neglect. The entire incident has subsequently come under the scrutiny of the police watchdog, which has delved into the case to uncover the truth behind McCourt's death. Upon investigating the matter, the watchdog has expressed its recognition of the \\"catalogue of failures\\" that allegedly played a role in Lenny's demise. This disturbing conclusion only amplifies the family's accusation and showcases the need for a systemic reform to end such tragic outcomes. In a time where trust in law enforcement is dwindling, the McCourt case serves as a resonant reminder of the grim consequences that can arise from negligence within the force. The pain and suffering endured by Lenny's family further underscores the urgency for a thorough examination and reevaluation of police conduct, training, and response in critical situations. As the investigation unfolds and more details come to light, the McCourt family remains steadfast in their pursuit of justice for Lenny. Aided by the ever-watchful eyes of the public and the continuous efforts of the police watchdog, they hope to see those responsible held accountable for their failures. Ultimately, the resolution of this tragic case may lead to a safer and more accountable law enforcement landscape, saving lives and preventing any further loss of innocent life due to negligence or misconduct. In light of the ongoing public outcry for a more ethical and accountable police force, the Lenny McCourt case forces us to confront the harsh reality that even the most innocuous and well-intended encounters can have fatal consequences. Through steadfast vigilance and unyielding dedication to the pursuit of justice, the McCourt family embodies the hope of a brighter future, where such tragic circumstances can be avoided and a lasting change can be implemented within the system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: - Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"A: The last step in the process, after the metamorphic rocks melt, is the formation of new magma, which will eventually lead to the creation of new rocks. To give a detailed explanation, let's break down each step in the rock cycle and see where it leads us. 1. Magma formation: Magma is molten rock material that is formed within the Earth's mantle due to extreme heat and pressure. It primarily consists of silicate minerals mixed with dissolved gases and water. 2. Cooling and crystallization: As the magma rises to the Earth's crust, either through a volcanic eruption or tectonic activity, it starts to cool down. As the temperature decreases, the magma begins to crystallize, and the minerals within the magma start forming solid crystals. 3. Formation of igneous rocks: When the magma has cooled and solidified, it forms a type of rock called igneous rock. There are two major types of igneous rocks: extrusive rocks, which cool and solidify quickly on the Earth's surface (e.g., basalt), and intrusive rocks, which cool slowly beneath the Earth's surface (e.g., granite). 4. Weathering and erosion: Over time, igneous rocks exposed to the Earth's surface break down due to weathering (physical and chemical processes) and erosion (transportation of rock fragments by water, wind, or ice). These processes create smaller rock fragments and sediments. 5. Formation of sedimentary rocks: As the sediments accumulate and are buried, they become compacted and cemented together, forming sedimentary rocks. There are many types of sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone, limestone, and shale. 6. Transformation into metamorphic rocks: Sedimentary rocks that are subjected to high heat and/or pressure due to tectonic activity are transformed into metamorphic rocks. This transformation causes the rock's mineral composition and texture to change, leading to the formation of new minerals and different rock structures. Examples of metamorphic rocks include marble, schist, and gneiss. 7. Melting of metamorphic rocks: The final step in the process is when the metamorphic rocks are exposed to extreme heat from the surrounding mantle materials or other sources, causing them to melt once again. This melting of metamorphic rocks triggers the formation of new magma, thus returning the process back to the first step. The new magma can eventually rise and be erupted from a volcano or intruded into the Earth's crust, where it will cool and solidify to form new igneous rocks. The rock cycle is a continuous process that occurs over millions of years, shaping and transforming the Earth's crust and giving us an understanding of its dynamic geologic history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both have been shot and are in pain. Joshua thinks back to his childhood, when his father was shot in front of his eyes. In a flashback, Joshua and his partner, Mickey, visit people that owe money to Vincent. They encounter a crazy druggie who tells them that a small-time drug dealer named Frankie Tahoe wants to kill Vincent. Joshua and Mickey inform Vincent, and the trio intimidate a guy who works for Tahoe into telling them where he can be found. They find Tahoe at a nightclub.

Potty-Training Your Toddler: Is There a Right Way? When it comes to potty-training, parents' methods vary greatly. Some take a regimented, reward-and-punishment approach, while others ease into it by encouraging poop talk. Is any one way better than the next? Sorry, parents, there is surprisingly little evidence on the effectiveness of toilet training techniques, reports Dr. Darcie Kiddoo, a professor in the divisions of pediatric surgery and urology at the University of Alberta. In her brief review of the available literature, published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Kiddoo highlighted two main philosophies in potty-training technique: one, which was first introduced by pediatrician Dr. T. Berry Brazelton in 1962 — and later promoted by Dr. Spock — is child-oriented. Once children are mentally and physically ready to exert bladder and bowel control, and show interest in doing so, parents are encouraged to let the process unravel in an unregimented and child-focused way, generally using coaxing, repetition and encouragement, while avoiding absolute rules that could result in behavioral problems. In a group of 1,170 children who started potty-training this way at 18 months, Kiddoo reports, daytime continence was achieved by 28.5 months on average. In 1973, Dr. Nathan Azrin and Dr. Richard Foxx prescribed a contrasting, parent-focused technique. The doctors also recommended beginning only when the child was psychologically and physiologically ready, then using a regimented, four-step process that includes a strategic increase of fluids, a bathroom schedule, positive reinforcement and strong correction of accidents. Two small studies using this method, of 34 and 49 children, respectively, suggested that the average time until continence was just 4.5 hours. (Other methods noted by Kiddoo involve potty-training infants by holding them over the toilet after meals and \\"making a noise that is linked to elimination\\"; using rewards like affection and candy when kids stay dry, and using punishment or lack of positive attention when kids have accidents; or attaching daytime wetting alarms to diapers, which ring when wet and signal that it's time for the potty. None have been adequately scientifically studied.) Based on her review, Kiddoo concluded that there really isn't enough evidence to recommend one training philosophy over another. There is some data to suggest, however, that higher rates of incontinence and urinary tract infections in children may be associated with reward-and-punishment techniques or with later potty training. Despite the lack of hard evidence, pediatricians groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), recommend that parents use a child-centric approach, planning to get started at about 18 months of age, only if the child shows interest in toilet training. Kiddoo offered some advice for parents who are anxious about their child's bathroom behavior: For more information on potty training, check out the Mayo Clinic's tips.

Pitt sets out after the car to try and retrieve the gun.Meanwhile, on the way to Vegas Roberts is in a restroom when a gunman grabs her and before anything happens, James Gandolfini saves her by shooting the man. Gandolfini claims that he is working for the mobster and that his name is Leroy. He is a very sensitive, gay psychotic killer who is there to protect Roberts.They get to Vegas and along the way Gandolfini picks up a gay postal worker who spends a romantic evening with Gandolfini. In the morning Roberts and Gandolfini go out for breakfast and while they're eating, the gunman goes to their hotel room and kills the postal worker by throwing him off the balcony. Roberts and Gandolfini get back and this time Gandolfini shoots the man in the head to kill him for good.Roberts and Gandolfini are told by Balaban to head to Mexico and meet Pitt because things have gone wrong.In Mexico, Pitt has recovered the gun and then lost it a second time.

Pitt has an argument with Roberts and nearly wrecks the car causing a blowout. While Pitt is changing the tire, Gandolfini pulls a gun on him. Roberts is furious with Pitt and has been walking away. Pitt hasn't seen Gandolfini's gun yet but Gandolfini sees Roberts walking away and puts his gun away. He knows that Roberts loves Pitt and he just can't kill him.Gandolfini helps Pitt change the tire and now Pitt pulls a gun on Gandolfini. Gandolfini sees the gun in the reflection on the hubcap and turns to fire but Pitt shoots first and kills Gandolfini.It seems that Pitt had once met Leroy and knew that Gandolfini was not who he claimed to be. He realized that he was there to kill him. Roberts is extremely upset but Pitt and her stay together trying to decide what to do now.In their hotel room, Pitt looks out the window and see someone trying to break into his car. the same person that stole it the first time. He goes down to stop him and is punched in the face (twice) and knocked out.He is driven to a very nice ranch house and there he meets the mob boss who has been let out of prison - Gene Hackman.In prison Hackman was befriended by the grandson of the ranchowner. the son was killed saving the life of Hackman in prison.

On the wedding day the nobleman's son is presented with the gun and it fails to work. He notices his future bride and the assistant staring at each other. He realizes they are in love and shoots and kills the assistant. The girl picks up the gun, puts it to her head and shoots herself.

Hugh Redwald Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton, FBA (15 January 1914 - 26 January 2003), was a British historian of early modern Britain and Nazi Germany. He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford. Trevor-Roper was made a life peer in 1979 on the recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, choosing the title Baron Dacre of Glanton. Trevor-Roper was a polemicist and essayist on a wide range of historical topics, but particularly England in the 16th and 17th centuries and Nazi Germany. In November 1945, Trevor-Roper was ordered by Dick White, the then head of counter-intelligence in the British sector of Berlin, to investigate the circumstances of Adolf Hitler's death, and to rebut the Soviet propaganda that Hitler was alive and living in the West. Using the alias of \\"Major Oughton\\", Trevor-Roper interviewed or prepared questions for several officials, high and low, who had been present in the Fuhrerbunker with Hitler, and who had been able to escape to the West, including Bernd Freytag von Loringhoven. For the most part Trevor-Roper relied on investigations and interviews by hundreds of British, American and Canadian intelligence officers. He did not have access to Soviet materials. Working rapidly, Trevor-Roper drafted his report, which served as the basis for his most famous book, The Last Days of Hitler in which he described the last ten days of Hitler's life, and the fates of some of the higher-ranking members of the inner circle as well of key lesser figures. Trevor-Roper transformed the evidence into a literary work, with sardonic humour and drama, and was much influenced by the prose styles of two of his favourite historians, Edward Gibbon and Lord Macaulay. The book was cleared by British officials in 1946 for publication as soon as the war crimes trials ended. It was published in English in 1947; six English editions and many foreign language editions followed. According to American journalist Ron Rosenbaum, Trevor-Roper received a letter from Lisbon written in Hebrew stating that the Stern Gang would assassinate him for The Last Days of Hitler, which they considered portrayed Hitler as a \\"demoniacal\\" figure but let ordinary Germans who followed Hitler off the hook, and for this he deserved to die. Rosenbaum reports that Trevor-Roper told him this was the most extreme response he had ever received for one of his books. Trevor-Roper was famous for his lucid and acerbic writing style. In reviews and essays he could be pitilessly sarcastic, and devastating in his mockery. In attacking Arnold J. Toynbee's A Study of History, for instance, Trevor-Roper accused Toynbee of regarding himself as a Messiah complete with \\"the youthful Temptations; the missionary Journeys; the Miracles; the Revelations; the Agony\\". For Trevor-Roper, the major themes of early modern Europe were its intellectual vitality, and the quarrels between Protestant and Catholic states, the latter being outpaced by the former, economically and constitutionally. In Trevor-Roper's view, another theme of early modern Europe was expansion overseas in the form of colonies and intellectual expansion in the form of the Reformation and the Enlightenment. In Trevor-Roper's view, the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries can ultimately be traced back to the conflict between the religious values of the Reformation and the rationalistic approach of what became the Enlightenment. Trevor-Roper argued that history should be understood as an art, not a science and that the attribute of a successful historian was imagination. He viewed history as full of contingency, with the past neither a story of continuous advance nor of continuous decline but the consequence of choices made by individuals at the time. In his studies of early modern Europe, Trevor-Roper did not focus exclusively upon political history but sought to examine the interaction between the political, intellectual, social and religious trends. His preferred medium of expression was the essay rather than the book. In his essays in social history, written during the 1950s and 1960s, Trevor-Roper was influenced by the work of the French Annales School, especially Fernand Braudel and did much to introduce the work of the Annales school to the English-speaking world. In the 1950s, Trevor-Roper wrote that Braudel and the rest of the school were doing much innovative historical work but were \\"totally excluded from Oxford which remains, in historical matters, a retrograde provincial backwater\\". In Trevor-Roper's opinion, the dispute between the Puritans and the Arminians was a major, although not the sole, cause of the English Civil War. For him, the dispute was over such issues as free will and predestination and the role of preaching versus the sacraments; only later did the dispute become a matter of the structure of the Church of England. The Puritans desired a more decentralised and egalitarian church, with an emphasis on the laity, while the Arminians wished for an ordered church with a hierarchy, an emphasis on divine right and salvation through free will. As a historian of early modern Britain, Trevor-Roper was known for his disputes with fellow historians such as Lawrence Stone and Christopher Hill, whose materialist (and in some measure \\"inevitablist\\") explanations of the English Civil War he attacked. Trevor-Roper was a leading player in the historiographical storm over the gentry (also known as the Gentry controversy), a dispute with the historians R. H. Tawney and Stone, about whether the English gentry were, economically, on the way down or up, in the century before the English Civil War and whether this helped cause that war. Stone, Tawney and Hill argued that the gentry were rising economically and that this caused the Civil War. Trevor-Roper argued that while office-holders and lawyers were prospering, the lesser gentry were in decline. A third group of history men around J. H. Hexter and Geoffrey Elton, argued that the causes of the Civil War had nothing to do with the gentry. In 1948, a paper put forward by Stone in support of Tawney's thesis was vigorously attacked by Trevor-Roper, who showed that Stone had exaggerated the debt problems of the Tudor nobility. He also rejected Tawney's theories about the rising gentry and declining nobility, arguing that he was guilty of selective use of evidence and that he misunderstood the statistics.

A small watchmaker in Switzerland in 1922 designed the first automatic watch to show the day, month , and date. Only seven of these splendid watches were ever made and these watches were almost lost to history. Today, it is so hard to get and original watch that some watch historians are even willing to offer 200,000 for one. These watches attracted a lot of people for their splendid color1, fashionable style and new uses in the 1920s. The owners of the watches were admired and set apart from the crowd. Because the number of the original watches is very limited, owning such a watch will make you feel very special. Today, you are offered the same kind of watch with improvement. It has a 24-jewel mechanical movement, the kind desired by watch collectors. The watchmaker has made the movement of the watch much more modern with an automatic rotor so that the watch never needs to be wound by hand. The watch comes in a very beautiful case with a crocodile design on it. To get a watch in such a perfect design means to get a chance to know a piece of watch-making history and to wear such a watch will show your personal taste and social position.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Older fathers have uglier children, researchers have claimed after linking age to genetic mutations . The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Before Medal of Honor, beer with Obama LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Dakota Meyer saved 36 lives from an ambush in Afghanistan and the former Marine will collect the nation's highest military honor at the White House on Thursday. While he is receiving the Medal of Honor, Meyer's slain comrades will be memorialized in hometown ceremonies at his request. His hero's moment was his darkest day. Meyer lost some of his best friends the morning of Sept. 8, 2009, in far-off Kunar Province. \\"It's hard, it's ... you know ... getting recognized for the worst day of your life, so it's... it's a really tough thing,\\" Meyer said, struggling for words. Meyer: Afghan battle was \\"worst day of my life\\" Meyer charged through heavy insurgent gunfire on five death-defying trips in an armored Humvee to save 13 Marines and Army soldiers and another 23 Afghan troops pinned down by withering enemy fire. Meyer personally killed at least eight insurgents despite taking a shrapnel wound to one arm as he manned the gun turret of the Humvee and provided covering fire for the soldiers, according to the military. President Barack Obama will bestow the medal at a White House ceremony. The two have also met privately, having a beer on a patio outside the Oval Office on Wednesday. \\"Over the weekend, the President's staff called Meyer in preparation for Thursday's Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House. Meyer asked the staffer if he could have a beer with the President. POTUS invited Dakota to come by the White House this afternoon,\\" spokesman Jay Carney tweeted. Appearing on \\"The Early Show\\" Thursday, Meyer said he took the opportunity to ask the president for advice on how to be successful. \\"He said, 'You know, first thing, get an education and he said just take it slow and don't try to make any rash decisions,'\\" he said. In Afghanistan, Meyer was part of a security team supporting a patrol moving into a village in the Ganjgal Valley on the day of the ambush. Meyer and the other Americans had gone to the area to train Afghan military members when, suddenly, the village lights went out and gunfire erupted. About 50 Taliban insurgents on mountainsides and in the village had ambushed the patrol. As the forward team took fire and called for air support that wasn't coming, Meyer, a corporal at the time, begged his command to let him head into the incoming fire to help. Four times he was denied his request before Meyer and another Marine, Staff Sgt. Juan Rodriguez-Chavez, jumped into the Humvee and headed into the fray. For his valor, Rodriguez-Chavez, a 34-year-old who hailed originally from Acuna, Mexico, would be awarded the Navy Cross. \\"It's simple, you know. My guys were in there and they were in there fighting and I needed to be in the fight with them,\\" Meyer told \\"The Early Show.\\" \\"I think all of us went in the valley, accepted we wouldn't make it out and that is just part of it.\\" With Meyer manning the Humvee's gun turret, the two drew heavy fire. But they began evacuating wounded Marines and American and Afghan soldiers to a safe point. Meyer made five trips into the kill zone, each time searching for the forward patrol with his Marine friends  including 1st Lt. Michael Johnson  whom Meyer had heard yelling on the radio for air support. With Meyer and Rodriguez-Chavez ready to test fate a fifth time in the kill zone, a UH-60 helicopter arrived at last to provide overhead support. Troops aboard the chopper told Meyer they had spotted what appeared to be four bodies. Meyer knew those were his friends and he had to bring them out. \\"It might sound crazy, but it was just, you don't really think about it, you don't comprehend it, you don't really comprehend what you did until looking back on it,\\" Meyer said. Wounded and tired, Meyer left the relative safety of the Humvee and ran out on foot. \\"He just really took a chance,\\" Dwight Meyer said. Ducking around buildings to avoid heavy gunfire, he reached the bodies of Johnson, a 25-year-old from Virginia Beach; Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, 30, of Roswell, Ga.; Corpsman James Layton, 22, of Riverbank, Calif.; and Edwin Wayne Johnson Jr., a 31-year-old gunnery sergeant from Columbus, Ga. Meyer and two other soldiers dodged bullets and rocket-propelled grenades to pull the bodies out of a ditch where the men had died while trying to take cover. The deaths of Meyer's comrades prompted an investigation into events that day, and two Army officers were later reprimanded for being \\"inadequate and ineffective\\" and for \\"contributing directly to the loss of life.\\" Along with Meyer's friends, a fifth American  Army Sgt. Kenneth W. Westbrook, 41, of Shiprock, N.M.  was fatally wounded in the ambush. Meyer said he'll be humbled by the memory of his fallen comrades as he receives the award Thursday. One of the memorials will be at a Columbus cemetery for gunnery sergeant Johnson, a father of three who served nearly 13 years in the U.S. Marine Corps. Will Duke, one of the organizers, said the memorials spoke volumes about Meyer. \\"I can tell by his actions, not only the actions he took in earning the Medal of Honor in Afghanistan but also the actions he is taking now. Essentially by requesting these memorial services for his fallen comrades, he's saying this is about them,\\" Duke said.","completion":"Dakota Meyer, a former Marine, is set to receive the Medal of Honor, the highest military honor in the United States, at the White House for his bravery in saving 36 lives during an ambush in Afghanistan.

Summarize this article: Murderer sues state for right to look at porn Posted: Monday, October 20, 2014 5:48 PM EDT Updated: Monday, November 17, 2014 9:52 PM EST Dwight Pink, Jr. is suing the state over what he calls his right to view sexually explicit materials. (DOC photo) A convicted murderer at a prison in Cheshire thinks he should be able to view sexually explicit materials. Dwight Pink, Jr., 40, is suing the state. He said its ban on pornography in prison violates his constitutional rights. Pink is serving a 50-year sentence at the Cheshire Correctional Institution for his part in the 1998 murder of a 35-year-old father of two in Old Saybrook. Despite the conviction for a violent crime, Pink believes it's his right to view such material behind bars. Some folks Eyewitness News spoke with were baffled that Pink would have the audacity to ask for such a thing. \\"Absolutely not,” said Tammy McKechnie of Rocky Hill. “It's not their right. It's not their privilege. They're in there for a reason.\\" The lawsuit stems from Pink's rejected request to get a book called “Art Models 7.” The book contains photos of men and women in various poses and shows how to draw the human form. “They're supposed to be in there to better themselves,” said Luis Figueroa of Rocky Hill. “So I don't think they should be allowed to do that.\\" \\"They got arrested for a crime they did and they shouldn't be watching women or porn or anything like that,\\" agreed Semir Huric, also of Rocky Hill. In 2012, the state Department of Corrections banned printed material depicting sexual activity or nudity. Pink's suit claims prison guards have used that policy to deny him the art book, which he says is a violation of his free speech rights. The state filed its response on Monday and said Pink has not been harmed by the ban and that none of his rights have been violated. Still, some people aren't so sure about that. \\"While I disagree with the subject matter, I think it might be an infringement of rights as an American even though you are incarcerated,” said Dustin Schultz of Rocky Hill. Pink is not just suing to get a look at the book. He's also asking for his attorneys' fees and an additional 25,000. Copyright 2014 WFSB (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved. ||||| HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A convicted murderer sentenced to more than a half-century behind bars is suing the state of Connecticut, saying its ban on pornography in prison violates his constitutional rights. Dwight Pink Jr., 44, says in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in July that guards have used the policy to deny him an art book, \\"The Atlas of Foreshortening,\\" which uses nude models to help show how to draw the human form. Pink says the ban is a violation of his free speech rights and serves no meaningful objective in prison. The state filed its response Monday, saying Pink has not been harmed by the ban and none of his rights were violated. \\"Any injury or harm, if any, was caused solely by plaintiff's own acts, omissions, or conduct and was not due to any wrongful conduct by the defendants,\\" Assistant Attorney General Steven Strom wrote. The state Department of Correction put out the administrative directive in 2011. It bans all material that contains \\"pictorial depictions of sexual activity or nudity\\" from the prisons. But it also says the ban should not apply to \\"materials which, taken as a whole, are literary, artistic, educational or scientific in nature.\\" A prison spokesman at the time said the ban was intended to improve the work environment for prison staffers, especially female staffers, who might be inadvertently exposed to pornography. It led to a letter-writing campaign and threats of lawsuits from inmates upset with the policy. Jaclyn Falkowski, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office, said about a half dozen lawsuits have been filed since then challenging the ban in both federal and state courts. She said those cases are still being litigated. But a judge in 2012 refused to issue a preliminary injunction allowing inmate Akove Ortiz to possess magazines like \\"Playboy.\\" \\"Although prisoners do not forfeit all of their constitutional rights upon incarceration, the fact of incarceration and the needs of the prison system impose limitations on prisoners' constitutional rights, even those derived from the First Amendment,\\" the judge wrote in his ruling. William Dunlap, a law professor at Quinnipiac University, said courts have generally sided with prison officials in such cases if they can prove the ban has a legitimate goal other than to simply suppress material that some people might find objectionable — such as maintaining safety in the prisons or keeping the material out of the hands of sex offenders. But he said the lawsuit has a chance of succeeding if Pink can show it was improperly used in his case to suppress art or literature. \\"I think that's a much stronger argument than saying the statute itself is facially unconstitutional,\\" he said. Pink is serving a 56-year sentence for his part in the 1998 slaying of a 35-year-old father of two in Old Saybrook. Scott Rufin was shot up to five times in the head with two guns and stabbed in the heart seven times with a sword, authorities said. Pink led authorities to the skeletal remains two years after the killing, which he said was committed by another man. |||||","completion":"A man in prison named Dwight Pink Jr. is suing the state because he thinks he should be able to look at adult pictures and read adult books in prison.

At first, it may just seem like a flash of white, but upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that this little critter is a white squirrel. The sight of a white squirrel can be both enchanting and bewildering, as it feels like catching a glimpse at something rare and remarkable. Despite the odds of such an occurrence being quite slim, these charming creatures do exist and showcase the marvelous diversity in the animal kingdom. In this article, we will explore the rarity of the white squirrel, what causes its unique appearance, and the significance of these animals in various cultures. The Rarity of the White Squirrel White squirrels are indeed rare; it is estimated that the odds of a squirrel being born with white fur are one in 100,000. The reason behind the existence of these uncommon creatures lies in their genetics. White squirrels are the result of a genetic mutation, specifically the partial or complete absence of the pigment melanin. It is this pigment that determines the coloration of animals, including squirrels. The absence or reduction of melanin results in a range of white coloration, from pure white to varying shades of gray. White Squirrels: Albinism versus Leucism White squirrels can be broken down into two categories: albinistic white squirrels and leucistic white squirrels. Albinism is a recessive genetic condition that results from a specific gene mutation, causing the complete absence of melanin production. Albino squirrels are characterized by their pure white fur, pink or red eyes, and light-colored skin. Leucistic squirrels, on the other hand, are not entirely devoid of melanin but have a reduced amount. This condition leads to white or patchy fur, but unlike albinos, these squirrels have dark-colored eyes and skin. While albino squirrels may face various challenges in the wild, like increased sensitivity to sunlight and a higher chance of being detected by predators, leucistic squirrels do not share these difficulties, as they still retain partial melanin presence. White Squirrels in Various Cultures The appearance of white squirrels has long been associated with various cultural beliefs and superstitions. In some Native American tribes, the white squirrel is considered a symbol of prophecy. The Cherokee people believed that the sight of a white squirrel was a sign to avoid conflict or war. In modern times, white squirrels have become a symbol of pride and identity for some communities. For example, in Olney, Illinois, the town has adopted the white squirrel as their mascot and has even established protective measures to ensure the continued survival of their unique furry residents. There are also annual white squirrel festivals organized in various towns, like the White Squirrel Festival in Brevard, North Carolina, which celebrates these rare animals and raises awareness about their conservation. Conservation and Protective Measures Given the rarity and the vulnerability of white squirrels, particularly albino ones, it is essential that we work towards protecting and conserving these animals. Habitat preservation, monitoring squirrel populations, and educating the public about these species' unique needs and challenges are critical steps in ensuring their survival. As awareness about these creatures grows, more individuals and communities will take up the responsibility to safeguard them. Conclusion The white squirrel may seem like a mystical creature that only exists in urban legends, but they are very much real and truly captivating to behold. These unique animals provide us with a glimpse into the diverse and wonderful world of nature and remind us that sometimes the most extraordinary things can be found right in our own backyards. So the next time you catch a glimpse of a white squirrel, take a moment to appreciate the serendipity of the experience, snap a picture if you can, and share the story of these fascinating creatures with others. The knowledge and awareness about white squirrels not only add to the richness of our natural world but also reminds us of our collective responsibility to preserve and protect the precious environment that we share with them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You can have an amazing date at almost any type of restaurant, not just fancy and expensive ones. It can be a cantina with great margaritas, a French restaurant with luxurious entrees, even the new ice cream place. You may want to choose a place you have been to before, or that someone you know has recommended. Nothing sours a date like ending up in a restaurant with prices that are shockingly high or food and service that's sub par. Check on the menu pricing. You can often get a sample menu online, and many restaurant reviews will give an idea of what you can expect to pay. This helps avoid an uncomfortable situation: finding yourself short of money, or at an unexpectedly extremely cheap or expensive eatery. Plan to pay for your date's meal if you are the one who's organizing the date. If you spent the day kayaking in the ocean, consider having a casual meal. You could get lunch or dinner from a food truck, or buy sandwiches from a deli near the beach. If you are both sandy, sweaty, and wearing your beach gear, it might not be appropriate or practical to go to the expensive seafood restaurant. If you're going to be quite active all day, you could consider packing a picnic. Bring a bottle of champagne or wine to share to make it extra special. While casual dining is great for a date, avoid eating at a fast food place if at all possible. It's not the price of the food that matters, but the originality. Take your date somewhere special. When your date recounts details to her best friend, you don't want her description to include, “And then we went to McDonalds.” Nothing could be more romantic than planning and cooking an entire meal for your date. If you're planning to have a date night in, it's a way to make your date feel very special. Plus, having good cooking skills is impressive and sexy. Just be sure to cook something you have made before, so you know it'll turn out and taste delicious. You don't have to make a complicated six-course meal, but you also probably should not invite someone over for frozen pizza. If you are going to cook at home, make something quality. Or at least from a high-quality market. Sometimes making dinner together can be fun and romantic. Pasta dishes are easy to make, and relatively inexpensive.

Write some highlights for the following article: England captain Eoin Morgan has urged his team-mates to 'stand up' to the next World Cup challenge of New Zealand after overseeing a humbling opening-day defeat to Australia. Morgan's men suffered a crushing 111-run loss in Melbourne after Australia plundered 342 for nine - the highest score England had ever conceded at a World Cup. The visitors could only reply with 231 in 41.5 overs and next up in Pool A are New Zealand, who host Morgan's team in Wellington next week. Eoin Morgan was unable to stop England losing to Australia after they performed poorly in the field. Morgan discusses tactics with James Anderson during their 111 run loss to Australia. Morgan told Sky Sports World Cup Live: 'They'll probably be the toughest two games of the group stage and we know they're a good test of where we're at. 'If we keep testing ourselves against the best sides and learning as the tour progresses, hopefully we'll hit our straps come the quarter-finals. 'But I think the senior players have got to stand up, myself included, and lead the way from the front.' The Irishman admitted England had fielded poorly, with Australian centurion Aaron Finch among the big-hitters dropped on Saturday. Mitchell Marsh celebrates dismissing Morgan for a duck in at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 'I think we probably let ourselves down in the field - we didn't have a great day there. I think we needed all guns firing to chase down 340,' added Morgan. 'That's probably the most frustrating thing. We started a little bit slowly and a bit cold, which again has been disappointing.' Reflecting on the positives, Morgan praised Steven Finn following his five-wicket haul - which included a hat-trick - and pointed to the unbeaten 98 from James Taylor. Australia made their highest ever one-day score against England in their World Cup opener. He added: 'Finny taking the second five-for on this tour has been great and James Taylor was clearly very unlucky not to get a hundred at the end, as he struck the ball very cleanly.' Australia were largely indebted to Victorian batsman Finch, who hit 135 from 128 balls on his home ground. 'It was nice, a little bit surreal and it will take time for it to sink it but it's a great feeling to get a win first up,' he said. 'It's always a little bit iffy the first game of the tournament and there were a few nerves about but it's nice to get that out of the way. 'Everyone contributed right through the order with either bat or ball, or did something special in the field, so it's a great feeling to get this one out of the way and hopefully we'll take a lot of momentum through the rest of the tournament.'

Write an article based on this summary: There are few Irish businesses more exposed to the fall in value of sterling than mushroom producers.","completion":"Title: The Impact of Sterling Devaluation on Irish Mushroom Producers Introduction The fall in the value of sterling has made a significant impact on the global market, affecting several industries and businesses worldwide. Among those most exposed to this situation are Irish mushroom producers. Ireland boasts a thriving mushroom industry with the United Kingdom being its primary export market. This article will explore the consequences of the sterling devaluation on Irish mushroom producers, including the challenges they face and possible solutions they can consider. The Dependence on the UK Market Irish mushroom producers heavily rely on the UK market, with approximately 90% of their produce exported to their British neighbors. As a result, any currency fluctuations can create a domino effect on the industry. Since the 2016 Brexit referendum, the value of sterling has fallen significantly, leading to major financial challenges for the Irish mushroom sector. Loss in Profits and Sustainability The devaluation of the sterling directly affects the income of Irish mushroom producers. As the currency's value decreases, so does the profit the farmers receive when converting from sterling to euros. This has led to a drop in income for mushroom farmers, affecting their ability to maintain a sustainable business. With increased competition from other European countries, Irish mushroom producers now find it increasingly difficult to compete in price with their counterparts. Imminent Closure of Mushroom Farms The financial pressures caused by the devaluation have led to some mushroom farms shutting down their operations. With reduced income and mounting business costs, the sustainability of these farms is being threatened. Several Irish mushroom farmers have had to make the difficult decision to close their businesses, leading to job losses in the industry and a reduction in the overall production capacity. Possible Solutions and Strategies To combat the challenges posed by the devaluation of the sterling, Irish mushroom producers must explore new strategies and adapt their business models. Some potential solutions include: 1. Diversification: Expanding the product range can help Irish mushroom producers become less dependent on the UK market. By introducing new varieties, packaging, and value-added products, they can tap into new markets and attract a wider customer base. 2. Seeking Alternative Markets: By looking for opportunities beyond the UK, Irish mushroom farmers can reduce their exposure to currency fluctuations. With the European Union as a large market and neighboring countries seeking quality produce, there is potential for Irish mushrooms to penetrate new markets. 3. Hedging Strategy: Implementing a hedging strategy can help mitigate the risks involved with currency fluctuations. By using financial instruments such as options and forward contracts, Irish mushroom producers can protect their businesses against further devaluation and potentially benefit from favorable exchange rate movements. Conclusion While the devaluation of the sterling has undoubtedly presented significant challenges to Irish mushroom producers, it is essential for them to remain proactive and agile, adapting to the new market conditions. By exploring alternative markets, diversifying products, and implementing risk mitigation strategies, Irish mushroom farmers can safeguard their businesses and secure a sustainable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: A. vaporate B. cool off C. form crystals D. melt E. keep things cold A:","completion":"D. Melt When ice is not ice anymore, it usually means it has undergone a phase transition due to an increase in temperature or a change in pressure. In this case, the most probable and common-sense option is that the ice has melted. Melting is the process where a solid, such as ice, transforms into a liquid, in this case, water. The melting point of ice is typically at or around 0°C (32°F) at a pressure of 1 atmosphere. When ice melts, the molecules of water gain energy and start vibrating more, weakening the bonds that hold them together in a solid-state. Eventually, the bonds break, and the water molecules become more separated from each other, causing the ice to turn into a liquid. This is a natural and common process that occurs when the temperature of the environment surrounding the ice increases. The other options do not align with the concept of ice not being ice anymore: A. Vaporate (evaporate): This refers to the process of a liquid turning into vapor or gas. While evaporation can occur with water after the ice has melted, it does not directly explain the change in the state of ice itself. B. Cool off: This implies a decrease in temperature. If ice were to cool off, it would remain ice or potentially become colder; it would not cause a change in its state. C. Form crystals: This option could describe the process of ice crystallizing from liquid water as it freezes. However, it does not correlate with ice not being ice anymore, as it represents the opposite transformation. E. Keep things cold: This option does not refer to a change in the state of ice; rather, it refers to its thermal property of absorbing heat and maintaining a lower temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since no specific process is mentioned, it is not possible to provide a precise century in which it became cheaper. Different processes or inventions might have become more affordable in various centuries, depending on advancements in technology, increased efficiency, and changes in demand or supply dynamics. For example, the process of producing paper became cheaper with the invention of the papermaking machine in the 19th century, while the process of producing steel became more affordable with the introduction of the Bessemer process in the mid-19th century.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Firstly, I will answer the second question to provide a context for the first question. A \\"sin\\" refers to an immoral act or wrongful deed committed against a moral, social, or religious code. In religious contexts, sin often refers to transgressions against the divine or holy laws. In a more general sense, sin can also encompass unethical behavior, like dishonesty, cruelty, or disrespect. As I interpret your question, \\"sin\\" refers to the wrongdoing or immoral actions of an individual, and you are asking about the perceived or real wrongdoings of a political figure, Narendra Modi. Now, I'll address the first question about the alleged sins of Narendra Modi. Narendra Modi is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014 and the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014. As with any political figure, there have been numerous controversies and criticisms surrounding his tenure. A few notable concerns are as follows: 1. 2002 Gujarat riots: One of the most significant controversies surrounding Modi's tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat was the communal violence in 2002. Following the death of 58 Hindu pilgrims in a train fire, riots erupted in Gujarat, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 1,000-2,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi's administration was criticized for their handling of the situation, with accusations of not doing enough to prevent the violence or protect the Muslim population. While Modi has been cleared by the Supreme Court of India, many still hold him responsible on moral or political grounds. 2. Economic policies: Modi's economic policies have sparked debate among citizens, with proponents claiming they stimulate growth and critics arguing they have adverse effects on various sectors of society. For instance, the demonetization in 2016, which invalidated 86% of India's currency overnight, aimed to combat corruption and unaccounted wealth. While the move received initial praise, it was criticized for hurting the informal economy, causing a temporary slowdown and financial distress for the Indian public. 3. Social and religious tensions: Critics argue that Modi's affiliation with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) promotes Hindu nationalism and exacerbates social and religious divisions within India. There have been concerns about the marginalization of religious minorities, such as Muslims and Christians, under his leadership. 4. Suppression of dissent: Modi's administration has been criticized for suppressing dissent and free speech, often using legal means to silence or threaten critics, journalists, or political adversaries. Critics argue that this stifles democratic processes and results in an erosion of democratic values. 5. Environmental concerns: Modi's government has been criticized for relaxing environmental regulations and prioritizing economic growth at the expense of the environment. Instances of this include the approval of industrial projects in ecologically sensitive areas and changes in policies that undermine environmental safeguards. It is essential to recognize that these \\"sins\\" are a matter of contention and subject to varying opinions. Some people believe that Narendra Modi has done a great deal of good for India, while others hold these concerns valid and consequential. In answer to your third question, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks about the perceived or real wrongdoings of a specific political figure, Narendra Modi, while the second question seeks a definition for the concept of \\"sin.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would \\"Materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","completion":"The exact lifespan of a flat membrane roof largely depends on the type of material used, the climate where the building is located, how well it was initially installed, and how it has been maintained over the years. There are three main types of materials used in flat membrane roofs: Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), and Thermoplastic Olefin (TPO). EPDM is a synthetic rubber roofing membrane that's widely used in low-slope buildings. It's resistant to weathering, abrasion, and extreme temperatures. With proper maintenance, EPDM roofs can last for 20 to 25 years. PVC roofing is one of the oldest and most reliable solutions for flat roofing. It's highly resistant to chemical damage, UV light, and fire. The lifespan of a PVC roof ranges from 20 to 30 years. TPO is a single-ply membrane that's made up of a blend of polypropylene and ethylene-propylene polymers. It's known for its durability, energy efficiency, and resistance to ozone, algae, and ultraviolet light. TPO roofing can usually last for 22 to 30 years. As for the statement, \\"Materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system,\\" it is a reasonably accurate description of how drainage should work with flat roofs. Water pooling is one of the biggest concerns with these kinds of roofs. A slight pitch or incline, typically at least 1/8 inch per foot, helps to facilitate the runoff. This prevents water from pooling and seeping into the building, which can lead to issues such as roof damage, leaks, and structural deterioration. In conclusion, a flat membrane roof, when properly installed and maintained, can last from 20 to 30 years depending on the materials used. And yes, it's ideal for the roof to have a slight inclination or camber to allow the water to run off into a gutter system, as water pooling can significantly reduce the lifespan of the roof."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who was a considerable influence on Handel in the three years that he spent in Hamburg? Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".
