Process: - An isotope has too many protons - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation. Question: suppose isotope has less protons happens, how will it affect isotope loses more atomic particles. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"B: less To understand this answer, we must first clarify some misconceptions mentioned in the question. Isotopes are varying forms of a particular element, and to be an isotope, these atoms must have the same number of protons. The only difference between isotopes is in the number of neutrons present in their nucleus. Due to this, an isotope can never have too many or too fewer protons, as suggested in the question. However, for the sake of the discussion, I will assume you meant an isotope with fewer neutrons. When an isotope has too few neutrons, it is considered neutron-deficient and will attempt to stabilize by increasing its neutron-to-proton ratio. In this case, the isotope can undergo beta-plus decay (or positron emission), which involves a proton changing into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino in the process. Now, let's consider the question: Suppose an isotope has fewer neutrons; how will it affect losing more atomic particles? The answer is B: less, and here's why: 1. When an isotope is neutron-deficient, it will undergo beta-plus decay, as previously mentioned. In this process, the isotope only emits a positron and a neutrino, both of which have little effect on the remaining atomic particles. 2. As the neutron-deficient isotope stabilizes through beta-plus decay, it will reduce the number of protons present but increase the number of neutrons. This change can lead to a more stable nucleus, discouraging further decay and reducing the number of lost atomic particles overall. 3. The process of beta-plus decay involves fewer particles than other forms of radioactive decay, such as alpha or beta-minus decay. Alpha decay would result in the loss of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (as a helium nucleus), while beta-minus decay would involve an electron being emitted, though this doesn't remove atomic particles in the nucleus. In conclusion, if an isotope has fewer neutrons, it will be more likely to undergo beta-plus decay in an attempt to stabilize. This process will typically result in fewer atomic particles being lost compared to other decay processes, such as alpha or beta-minus decay. This makes option B: less the most suitable answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

A:","completion":"To answer this detailed question, I need to conduct thorough research on information related to Tim Hegarty, Ross Graham, and car bombings in Northern Ireland. Here's my step-by-step approach: Step 1: Research on Tim Hegarty and Ross Graham - I will look for information about both figures, primarily focusing on their involvement in music or activism related to Northern Ireland and car bombings. Step 2: Identify car bombings in Northern Ireland - I will compile a list of car bombings that occurred in Northern Ireland, especially those that generated significant attention and could have possibly inspired a support album. Step 3: Investigate connections between Tim Hegarty, Ross Graham, and car bombings - With the compiled information from both steps 1 and 2, I will cross-reference and search for any links between this music duo and a specific car bombing in Northern Ireland.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Reull Vallis is a valley on Mars that appears to have been carved by water . It runs westward into Hellas Planitia . It is named after the Gaelic word for planet . - Astrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th-17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems. - The Noachis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Noachis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-27 (Mars Chart-27). - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km). - Hellas Planitia is a plain located within the huge, roughly circular impact basin Hellas located in the southern hemisphere of the planet Mars. Hellas is the third or fourth largest impact crater and the largest visible impact crater known in the Solar System. The basin floor is about deep, deeper than the Moon's South Pole-Aitken basin, and extends about east to west. It is centered at Hellas Planitia is in the Hellas quadrangle and the Noachis quadrangle. - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\". - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. - The Hellas quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Hellas quadrangle is also referred to as MC-28 (Mars Chart-28). The Hellas quadrangle covers the area from 240° to 300° west longitude and 30° to 65° south latitude on the planet Mars. Within the Hellas quadrangle lies the classic features Hellas Planitia and Promethei Terra. Many interesting and mysterious features have been discovered in the Hellas quadrangle, including the giant river valleys Dao Vallis, Niger Vallis, Harmakhis, and Reull Vallisall of which may have contributed water to a lake in the Hellas basin in the distant past. Many places in the Hellas quadrangle show signs of ice in the ground, especially places with glacier-like flow features. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.

Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream.

Eric Garth Hudson (born August 2, 1937) is a Canadian multi-instrumentalist. As the organist, keyboardist and saxophonist for Canadian-American rock group the Band, he was a principal architect of the group's unique sound. Hudson has been called \\"the most brilliant organist in the rock world\\" by Keyboard magazine. As of 2018, Hudson and fellow musician Robbie Robertson are the last original members of The Band who are still alive. Under the strict supervision of Hawkins, the Hawks became an accomplished band. They split from Hawkins in 1963, recorded two singles and toured almost continually, playing in bars and clubs, usually billed as Levon and the Hawks. Hudson started work as a session musician in 1965, playing on John Hammond, Jr.'s So Many Roads along with Robertson (guitar) and Helm (drums). In August 1965, they were introduced to Bob Dylan by manager Albert Grossman's assistant, Mary Martin. In October, Dylan and the Hawks recorded the single \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\", and in January 1966 they recorded material with Dylan for what would turn into the Blonde on Blonde album. Dylan recruited the band to accompany him on his controversial 1966 \\"electric\\" tour of the United States, Australia and Europe. (An album of Dylan's 1966 performance with his band, The \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" Concert, was finally released in 1998.) Subsequent to Bob Dylan's motorcycle accident in July 1966, the group settled in a pink house in West Saugerties, New York, near Woodstock. Dylan was a frequent visitor, and Hudson's recordings of their collaborations resulted in The Basement Tapes. By 1968, the group recorded its debut album, Music from Big Pink. The album was recorded in Los Angeles (at Capitol) and New York (at A&R Studio). Capitol originally announced that the group would be called the Crackers, but when Music From Big Pink was released they were officially named the Band. The album includes Hudson's organ showcase, \\"Chest Fever\\", a song that in the Band's live shows would be vastly expanded by a solo organ introduction, entitled \\"The Genetic Method\\", an improvisational work that would be played differently at each performance. An example can be heard on the live album Rock of Ages. Hudson is also adept at the accordion, which he played on some of the group's recordings, such as \\"Rockin Chair\\", from \\"The Band\\"; the traditional \\"Ain't No More Cane\\", from \\"The Basement Tapes\\"; Dylan's \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\"; and Bobby Charles's \\"Down South in New Orleans\\" during the Last Waltz. His saxophone solo work can be heard on such songs as \\"Tears of Rage\\" (from Big Pink) and \\"Unfaithful Servant\\" (from The Band). Hudson is credited with playing all of the brass and woodwinds on the studio version of \\"Ophelia\\", from the 1975 album Northern Lights - Southern Cross as well. This album, the first to be recorded in the Band's Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu, California, also saw Hudson adding synthesizers to his arsenal of instruments. Hudson provided innovative accompaniment. For example, the song \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" features Hudson playing a clavinet through a wah-wah pedal to create a swampy sound reminiscent of a Jew's harp or the croak of a frog. This clavinet-wah wah pedal configuration was later adopted by many funk musicians. After years of continuous touring, the Band made its final bow as a touring band with a lavish final concert on Thanksgiving Day 1976 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, an all-star tribute concert documented in The Last Waltz. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Any great singles by the band?","completion":"Yes, there are great singles by the Band.

According to the Moscow Armistice, signed by Finland and the victorious Allies, mainly the Soviet Union, the Finns were to try those who were responsible for the war and those who had committed war crimes. The Soviet Union allowed Finland to try its own war criminals, unlike other losing countries of the Second World War. The Finnish parliament had to create ex post facto laws for the trials, though in the case of war crimes the country had already signed the Hague IV Convention. In victorious Allied countries war-crime trials were exceptional, but Finland had to arrange full-scale investigations and trials, and report them for the Soviet Union. Criminal charges were filed against 1,381 Finnish POW camp staff members, resulting in 723 convictions and 658 acquittals. They were accused of 42 murders and 342 other homicides. Nine persons were sentenced to life sentences, 17 to imprisonment for 10-15 years, 57 to imprisonment for five to ten years, and 447 to imprisonment varying from one month to five years. Fines or disciplinary corrections were levied out in 124 cases. Although the criminal charges were highly politicized, some war crime charges were filed already during the Continuation War. However, most of them were not processed during wartime. How many more life sentences than imprisonment for the Finnish staff?","completion":"To determine how many more life sentences than imprisonment sentences were given to the Finnish staff for war crimes, we need to compare the number of life sentences to the number of imprisonment sentences.

Question: In high level competitions how many preliminary rountines are there? Answer: In high level competitions, there are two preliminary routines, one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete is free to perform any routine. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"In high-level competitions, the number of preliminary routines typically depends on the specific event and its organizing body. It may vary across different sports, disciplines, and competitive structures. For artistic gymnastics, for instance, high-level competitions like the Olympics or World Championships usually involve qualifications, team finals, and individual event finals. During qualifications, gymnasts perform routines on all apparatus to determine who will advance to the team and individual finals. Team finals then require athletes to perform routines to help their country achieve the highest total score. Finally, the top-scoring individuals move on to the individual event finals, where they compete for medals in each apparatus. For diving, high-level events like the Olympics or World Championships feature several rounds in the competitions, such as preliminaries, semi-finals, and finals. Divers perform multiple dives in each round, with their scores determining who progresses to the next stage. Swimming races at high-level competitions usually involve heats, semi-finals, and finals. The number of preliminary rounds depends on the number of swimmers competing and the specific event (such as the 50 meters freestyle or the 200 meters backstroke). In figure skating, athletes usually perform both a short program and a free skate in high-level competitions. Skaters are first ranked according to their scores in the short program, then perform the longer free skate, with both scores combined to determine the final placements. In summary, the number of preliminary routines or rounds in high-level competitions is not uniform across all sports and events. It depends on the specific competition and the rules set by the organizing body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats.

But those who are early to bed and early to rise do not always have advantages, researchers say. They have found that night owls are generally brighter and wealthier than those who are able to get up early in the morning. Experts from the University of Madrid carried out tests on around 1,000 teenagers and found that those who preferred to stay up late showed the kind of intelligence to find good jobs and earn much money. Larks or \\"morning people\\", however, often get better exam results, possibly because lessons are held at the wrong time of day for night owls.

School performance and problem solving ability, were judged and test grades in the major subjects were also taken into consideration.

The room was decent, nice big bathroom with tub and shower, though I'm not quite sure why there was a window between the bathroom and entrance foyer...unless we got one of the Kinky Rooms or something, though I don't really get off on watching my fiancee on the toilet, so this whole window thing is still over my head. We had a great view overlooking the entire pool area...and that is one big pool area...I think I counted six pools and a river....and a wonderful view of the mountains in the distance. everything looked beautiful lit up at night...one of the reasons I love coming to Vegas...a beautiful city of millions of lights plopped in the middle of the barren darkness of the Nevada desert. The hotel is laid out very nicely, everything is clean and classy...wonderful choice of restaurants, good buffet, lots of bars and shopping, with an easy walk to the Luxor next door..and that's about the only easy walk, because if you wanna go to any other casino on the strip, you have a hike ahead of you, or an expensive cab ride...because those buses they have on the Strip...SUCK.

The reviewer appears to be of the opinion that Johnson's use of renovated Aristotelian and Neoplatonist discourse to attack empiricism and critical inquiry does not meet their standards of proof. The reviewer also expresses concerns that Johnson's approach of suggesting normative propositions should not be subjected to empirical scrutiny or scientific evaluation is flawed. They suggest that it may promote a skewed and overly simplified view of the world that does not align with their own approach as a social scientist, which is to require concrete empirical evidence. The reviewer acknowledges that Johnson presents his case well, but overall, they seem largely unconvinced by it. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sentiment expressed in this review is negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Process: - Suns heat enters atmosphere - Green house gases enter from the earth - Heat is trapped in atmosphere - Different things on earth are hotter - The overall planet is hotter. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more gravity to pull happens, how will it affect Increased greenhouse gases. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The process described here involves the Earth's atmosphere and how the heat from the Sun and the presence of greenhouse gases lead to a warmer planet and climate change. To analyze the potential effects of the perturbation hypothesis, we must first break down each step of the process and then examine how increased gravity might impact the greenhouse effect and climate change. 1. Sun's heat enters the atmosphere: The heat from the Sun is primarily in the form of shortwave solar radiation, which penetrates the Earth's atmosphere. Some of the radiation is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere, while a portion is reflected back into space. 2. Greenhouse gases enter the atmosphere: Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor. They are naturally present in the Earth's atmosphere but have increased due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. Greenhouse gases are responsible for trapping heat in the atmosphere by absorbing longwave infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and then re-emitting it back toward the surface. 3. Heat is trapped in the atmosphere: The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, trapping heat and preventing it from escaping back to space. This process is known as the greenhouse effect. 4. Different things on Earth are hotter: As the greenhouse effect intensifies, more heat is trapped in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to various consequences such as a rise in average global temperatures, more extreme weather events, and changes in climate patterns. 5. The overall planet is hotter: The outcome of the increased greenhouse effect is a warmer Earth, which leads to a wide range of impacts, including sea-level rise, melting glaciers and ice sheets, and damage to ecosystems and biodiversity. Now let us consider the perturbation hypothesis: an increase in gravity affecting the greenhouse gases and, consequently, the climate change process. While an increase in gravity could potentially have an indirect effect on the climate, it would not directly impact the greenhouse effect. Gravity affects atmospheric pressure, which impacts the circulation of air and weather patterns. If gravity were to increase, we might see changes in atmospheric circulation and weather phenomena, possibly affecting the spread and distribution of greenhouse gases. However, this would be a rather indirect effect on the greenhouse effect itself. An increase in gravity could also influence the planet's overall composition and structure, for example, by compressing the atmosphere or causing a change in the Earth's shape due to the increased gravitational force. These changes could, in turn, have an indirect impact on climate change by affecting factors such as atmospheric pressure, wind patterns, and ocean currents. Additionally, increased gravitational forces could impact the biosphere, affecting the productivity and decomposition of organic matter, which would alter greenhouse gas production and absorption rates. In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis of increased gravity may have potential indirect effects on climate change, it would not directly impact the greenhouse effect. Consequently, the primary process responsible for climate change, involving solar radiation and greenhouse gas emissions, would remain largely unaffected by this hypothetical increase in gravity. The most effective way to address climate change remains, therefore, focusing on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the development of sustainable and renewable energy sources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Still reeling from her husband's death, Sarah is now moody and depressed. That evening, a mysterious woman (Dalle) arrives at Sarah's door, asking to use the telephone to call for help. Sarah lies that her husband is sleeping and she does not want to be disturbed, but the woman tells her that she knows that he is dead. When the visitor persists on coming in, Sarah, a professional photographer, attempts to take her photo through a window and telephones the police. When they arrive, the woman has already vanished. The police assure Sarah that she will be fine, but arrange to have a patrol car visit throughout the night. Upon developing her photos, Sarah recognizes the woman in the background of an earlier photo she had taken, indicating she was stalking Sarah. Sarah telephones her employer, asking to have the photos enhanced. As she goes to bed, the woman arrives in the bedroom, awakening Sarah with scissors puncturing her pregnant belly. Sarah fights the visitor off and locks herself in the bathroom, where the woman tries to gain entry. The woman makes clear that her intentions are to take Sarah's child for herself. Sarah's employer arrives, and not knowing what Sarah's mother looks like, takes the strange woman's word that she is the mother. Later her actual mother arrives, arousing the employer's suspicion.

The answer is:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"heterotrophs.\\" The type of plants that convert carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates through the process of photosynthesis are called \\"autotrophs\\" or more specifically, \\"photoautotrophs.\\" Autotrophs are organisms that have the ability to produce their own food using inorganic materials and an external energy source. There are two types of autotrophs: 1. Photoautotrophs: These organisms, which include green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, use light as their primary energy source and convert it into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. During this process, carbon dioxide and water combine in the presence of sunlight, producing glucose (a simple carbohydrate) and oxygen. 2. Chemoautotrophs: These are organisms, mostly bacteria and archaea, that obtain their energy from chemical reactions with inorganic compounds like hydrogen sulfide or ammonia. They do not rely on sunlight for their energy needs. In contrast, heterotrophs are organisms that cannot produce their own food and must obtain their energy by consuming other organisms or organic materials. Animals, fungi, and some bacteria are examples of heterotrophs. They rely on the consumption of plants (autotrophs) or other heterotrophs for their energy and nutrient requirements. In summary, the correct answer to the question \\"which type of plants convert carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates?\\" is \\"autotrophs,\\" specifically \\"photoautotrophs,\\" as they are the organisms that perform photosynthesis to produce carbohydrates from inorganic materials and sunlight."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first, under the command of Phraya Chakri, had 50,000 troops to attack Tenasserim. The second unit, under the command of Phraya Phra Khlang, had 50,000 troops to capture Dawei. Dawei and Tenasserim were cities in Thailand during Sukhothai period, which the Burmese had captured. However, the Governor of Tenasserim learned of the Siamese plans and sent an urgent message to the King of Pagu, Nanda Bayin, who ordered an army to oppose the Siamese.:139-140 Tenasserim resisted the siege for 15 days while the siege of Dawei lasted 20 days, before the Siamese were successful in capturing both cities. Both consented to be subject to Ayutthaya as in the past.:140 After Phraya Chakri captured Tenasserim city, he captured Mergui and the boats in the port, which included 3 foreign sloops and 150 other boats. He then sent Phraya Thep Archun by sea to Tavoy so as to assist Phraya Phra Khlang if the Burmese advanced that far. Phraya Chakri then marched with a force of 30,000 to Tavoy by land, leaving a garrison of 10,000 at Tenasserim under Phraya Sri Sainarong. Simultaneously, Phraya Phra Khlang sent 100 boats and 5,000 men under Phraya Phichai Songkhram and Phraya Ram Khamhaeng to assist Phraya Chakri.:141 The Burmese had sent 200 boats and 10,000 men under the command of Samin Ubkong and Samin Phataba.

Please answer the following question: Information: - In opera or commedia dell'arte, a prima donna (plural: \\"prime donne\\"; Italian for \\"first lady\\") is the leading female singer in the company, the person to whom the prime roles would be given. The prima donna was normally, but not necessarily, a soprano. The corresponding term for the male lead (almost always a tenor) is primo uomo. - Elisabeth Olin née Lillström ( December 1740 -- 26 March 1828 ) , was a Swedish opera singer and a music composer . She performed the leading female role in the inauguration performance of the Royal Swedish Opera in 1773 , and is referred to as the first Swedish Opera prima donna . She was the first female to be made Hovsångare ( 1773 ) , and the first woman to become a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music ( 1782 ) . - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else.

Write some highlights for the following article: Water can be made to appear to flow in a remarkable corkscrew shaped stream by means of a simple experiment involving the right frequency of bass and a video camera with an adjustable frame rate. A mesmerising YouTube video shows how one amateur scientist made the flow appear to stay still then, by adjusting bass frequency, rotate in both directions. The video, uploaded along with a how-to guide by user brusspup on Monday, has already gone viral - attracting nearly 500,000 views and nearly 18,000 'thumbs up'. Corkscrew: Water can be made to appear to flow in a remarkable corkscrew shaped stream by means of a simple experiment involving the right frequency of bass and a video camera with an adjustable frame rate. Brusspup said on the video-sharing site: 'This is a really fun project and when you first see the results, chances are your jaw will drop.' The effect cannot be seen with the naked eye, so anyone who wants to try it at home will have to first get their hands on a camera capable of shooting at exactly 24 frames per second. To recreate the effect, the first thing you will need to do is get hold of an amplifier and a speaker with a frequency response low enough to reach 23hz - a very low bass sound. Connect the speaker to a computer running tone generating software - many such programs are available as open-source freeware - and tune it down to 24hz. Take a soft rubber hose and connect that to your tap, then run it down past the speaker, across the cone, so that one or two inches hang past the bottom of the case, and tape it securely into place. Optical illusion: The effect cannot be seen with the naked eye, so anyone who wants to try it at home will have to first get their hands on a camera capable of shooting at exactly 24 frames per second. 'The goal is to make sure the hose is touching the actual speaker so that when the speaker produces sound (vibrates) it will vibrate the hose,' brusspup explains. Point the camera at the end of the hose, turn on your tap, press play on your tone generator and, as brusspup puts it: 'Watch the magic begin'. The effect can be changed by altering the frequency of the tone. Set it to 23hz and it will look like it's moving backwards. Set it to 25hz and the stream will appear as though its moving forward in slow motion. Variable: The effect can be changed by altering the frequency of the tone. Set it to 23hz and it will look like it's moving backwards. Set it to 25hz and the stream will appear as though its moving forward in slow motion. One of the top rated comments on the video's YouTube page explains how it works. User necraduq explains: 'When the frequency of the speaker is the same with the frequency of the video frames (frames/sec) the camera actually captures the same frame everytime and thus the same water shape. 'You can see the change 1hz makes when filming (if filming is kept at the same rate 24fps) as this translates into a \\"forward movement\\". 'Imagine a clock with only a seconds indicator. If you would close your eyes and open them precisely once every 60 seconds you would think the indicator is not moving.' Highlights:","completion":"1.

Hypothesis: A woman sweeps the sidewalk with a red broom. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"If we rely solely on the information provided in the premise, we cannot definitively confirm the hypothesis is true. To elaborate, the premise outlines three crucial details: first, the character involved is a middle-aged woman; second, the action she's undertaking is sweeping a sidewalk; and finally, the location of this scene is in front of a retail shop in a city. These facets match the hypothesis, which likewise mentions a woman sweeping. However, the hypothesis denotes an extra detail that is not mentioned nor implied in any way by the premise: that she uses a red broom. An assumption is made in the hypothesis where the color of the broom is concerned. The premise doesn't offer any detail or hint concerning the color of the broom. It simply states that the woman is sweeping, without further elaborating on the specific aspects, characteristics, or type of her sweeping tools. Thus, while it is possible that the broom she uses might be red, we can't conclude it outright. Hence, the truth of the hypothesis is contingent upon a piece of information — the color of the broom — that the initial premise doesn't provide. We can surmise that the woman is sweeping due to the premise, but we have no factual basis in the premise to definitively confirm that she's using a red broom. Consequently, unless additional evidence or context is presented that specifically demonstrates the broom being red, the hypothesis cannot be conclusively validated from the premise alone. In the study of logic, it's critical to differentiate what is explicitly stated (and hence can be inferred directly) vs. what is merely implied or possible. In this case, the color of the broom is not specified in the premise, so to infer its color would involve a degree of assumption or conjecture, which are not valid foundations for logical inferences. Thus, from a strictly logical point of view, the premise as it is does not lead us to conclude the hypothesis is true. Potentially, with more information, we might prove it true or false definitively, yet based on what we currently know, the hypothesis is just that - a hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States. The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest and Wyoming to the west. Its area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000 km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln. Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. - The Platte River is a major river in the state of Nebraska and is about long. Measured to its farthest source via its tributary the North Platte River, it flows for over . The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River, which itself is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The Platte over most of its length is a muddy, broad, shallow, meandering stream with a swampy bottom and many islandsa braided stream. These characteristics made it too difficult for canoe travel, and it was never used as a major navigation route by European-American trappers or explorers. - Papillion Creek is a 15.5 - mile - long ( 24.9 km ) tributary of the Missouri River in Nebraska . Its watershed lies in Washington , Douglas and Sarpy counties , including parts of the city of Omaha . The main branch of Papillion Creek is known as Big Papillion Creek . Some of the tributaries include Little Papillion Creek , Thomas Creek , Cole Creek , Northwest Branch of West Papillion Creek , West Papillion Creek and South Papillion Creek . Papillion Creek empties into the Missouri River south of Bellevue and just north of the mouth of the Platte River . Locals often refer to the creek as the \`\` Papio Creek '' . Within its watershed lie Glenn Cunningham Lake , Standing Bear Lake , Zorinsky Lake and Wehrspann Lake at the Chalco Hills Recreation Area , which were created by the Army Corps of Engineers in the aftermath of extensive flooding in 1964 and 1965 . - Groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - \\"Main Stem\\" is 1942 instrumental by Duke Ellington and His Famous Orchestra. Although recorded in 1942, the single would not be released until 1944 where it was Duke Ellington's last of four number one's on the Harlem Hit Parade. \\"Main Stem\\" also peaked at number twenty on the pop chart. - Montana is a state in the Western region of the United States. The state's name is derived from the Spanish word (mountain). Montana has several nicknames, although none official, including \\"Big Sky Country\\" and \\"The Treasure State\\", and slogans that include \\"Land of the Shining Mountains\\" and more recently \\"The Last Best Place\\". Montana has a border with three Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, the only state to do so. It also borders North Dakota and South Dakota to the east, Wyoming to the south, and Idaho to the west and southwest. Montana is ranked 4th in size, but 44th in population and 48th in population density of the 50 United States. The western third of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges. Smaller island ranges are found throughout the state. In total, 77 named ranges are part of the Rocky Mountains. The eastern half of Montana is characterized by western prairie terrain and badlands. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - The Midwestern United States, also referred to as the American Midwest or simply the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions defined by the United States Census Bureau, occupying the northern central part of the United States of America. It was officially named the North Central region by the Census Bureau until 1984. - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming. - The North Platte River is a major tributary of the Platte River and is approximately long counting its many curves. It travels about distance. Its course lies in the U.S. states of Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system. - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a \\"bayou\\", \\"beck\\", \\"branch\\", \\"brook\\", \\"burn\\", \\"creek\\", \\"crick\\", \\"ghyll\\", \\"gill\\", \\"kill\\", \\"lick\\", \\"mill race\\", \\"race\\", \\"rill\\", \\"river\\", \\"rivulet\\", \\"run\\", \\"runnel\\", \\"streamage\\", \\"syke\\", or \\"wash\\". - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than the population of 31 of the largest U.S. cities.

Mr. Louis, who went by the name Willie Reed before moving to Chicago after the historic trial in Mississippi, died July 18 at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, his wife said. Mr. Louis, a longtime Englewood resident, was 76. “What stood out, and what stands out to me about Willie the most, is his courage,” said Emmett Till’s cousin, the Rev. Wheeler Parker, 74, who had traveled to Mississippi with Emmett Till. “He was nothing but a godsend.” Mike Small, a teacher who has studied the landmark case, called Mr. Louis “one of the unsung civil rights heroes in Chicago.” Emmett Till was 14 years old when he was murdered after whistling at a white woman outside a grocery store in Mississippi. The youth was kidnapped and taken to a tool shed. It was near there that Mr. Louis, then 18, saw the boy in a truck with several other men. Mr. Louis also heard a beating coming from inside that tool shed. The truck had also been parked in front of the shed. In an interview with “60 Minutes” nearly a decade ago, Mr. Louis said, “I heard the screaming, beating, the screaming and beating.” Mr. Louis was also approached by one of the accused killers, J.W. Milam, who carried with him a pistol, and asked if he’d heard anything. Mr. Louis told him he hadn’t seen anything, he told “60 Minutes.” But Mr. Louis couldn’t keep secret what he saw, becoming a key witness in the trial. Despite his testimony, the all-white jury acquitted Milam and co-defendant Roy Bryant. The murder and acquittal were among the sparks that ignited the civil rights movement. “I couldn’t have walked away from that like that because Emmett was 14, probably never been to Mississippi in his life and had come to visit his grandfather, and they killed him. That’s not right,” he said in the interview. The trial took a toll on Mr. Louis. The Greenwood. Miss., native was whisked away after the trial and came to Chicago where he suffered a nervous breakdown, his wife, Juliet Louis, 68, said. Mr. Louis also changed his name to find anonymity. Mr. Louis worked at Jackson Park Hospital as a surgical orderly for nearly 50 years. That’s where he met his wife. The pair were working in the intensive care unit at the hospital and Mr. Louis sweet-talked the nurse’s aide. “He said ‘Hey there. Why don’t you come over here and give me a kiss?’” Juliet Louis said. “I went over there and kissed him on his jaw.” The couple married in 1976. It was nearly eight years later that Juliet Louis found out about her husband’s involvement in the Emmett Till case. “He never really got over that,” Juliet Louis said. That was something that really bothered him, and he was keeping it in him.” In addition to his wife, Mr. Louis is survived by his step-son, Sollie McKinnon; seven grandchildren and 21 great-grandchildren. Services will be held from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday at New Commandment Church of God in Christ, 1742 W. 63rd St. ||||| Willie Louis was a witness to the murder of Emmett Till, testifying in court on a case that opened the nation's eyes to the dangerous discrimination facing African-Americans in the 1950s. After the trial, fearing for his life in the South, he fled to Chicago, changed his name and slipped out of the public eye for nearly 50 years. \\"He was an unsung civil rights hero,\\" said Mike Small, a friend and history teacher who has studied the Till case. Mr. Louis, 76, died of intestinal bleeding Thursday, July 18, at Advocate Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn, a relative said. He was a resident of Chicago. Mr. Louis was born in Greenwood, Miss., where he lived with his grandparents, who worked as sharecroppers, said his wife, Juliet. On Aug. 28, 1955, Till, 14, visiting Mississippi from Chicago, was murdered after he allegedly whistled at a white woman. On that day, Mr. Louis, then known as Willie Reed, noticed two white men driving a truck into a barn with two black males in the back. He was standing with an older woman near a well when he heard a male screaming for his life inside the barn, his wife said. \\"He heard all this hollering and screaming until there was no more hollering and screaming,\\" she said. Later that day, a white man approached Mr. Louis with a gun, Juliet Louis said. \\"He said, 'Boy, did you see anything?' And he said 'no.' He said, 'Did you hear anything?' He said 'no.'\\" The next morning he found out that Till's body had been dumped in the Tallahatchie River. His grandfather told him he shouldn't bother telling anyone because it was too dangerous to accuse a white man of murder, but a few days later civil rights leaders asked him about what he may have seen, according to his wife. \\"He said he couldn't have lived with it; he had to tell them what he saw,\\" she said. He agreed to testify in court, and a local black doctor hid him until the trial started later that year. Despite his testimony, the two white men accused of the murder were acquitted by an all-white jury. After the trial, Mr. Louis got on a train to Chicago, where he changed his name. The psychological stress of witnessing a murder and testifying in court took a toll, causing him to suffer a nervous breakdown that landed him in a hospital, his wife said. Till's family lost touch with Mr. Louis soon after the trial, according to Till's relative Wheeler Parker, 74. \\"We thought something had happened to him,\\" he said. \\"We thought someone killed him.\\" In the late 1950s, Mr. Louis became an orderly at Woodlawn Hospital in Chicago and later at Jackson Park Hospital. He worked at Jackson Park until he retired in 2006, his wife said. The couple met at Jackson Park in 1971. She was working as a nursing aide in the intensive care unit when Mr. Louis came to pick up patient. The couple married in 1976, but it would be another eight years before Juliet Louis ever found out her husband was a witness in the Till case, she said. Even after she found out, \\"he didn't talk about it much.\\" That changed when a journalist, Stanley Nelson, came to Mr. Louis' home in Englewood asking him to participate in his research project about the murder. \\"Stanley started having him bring back memories,\\" his wife said. \\"It opened up a wound.\\" Nelson's research turned into a book and a documentary, which eventually aired on PBS. Nelson introduced Mr. Louis to Till's mother. Soon after, Mr. Louis began talking about what he witnessed publicly on television and community events. Those close to him hope his legacy will last beyond his death. \\"I think his story needs to be told over and over again,\\" Parker said. \\"He's a great role model in doing what's right.\\" Mr. Louis is also survived by a son, Sollie McKinnon. A visitation is set for 6 to 8 p.m. Wednesday at New Commandment Church of God in Christ, 1742 W. 63rd St., Chicago. nnix@tribune.com Twitter:@nsnix87 ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Willie Louis was a brave man who heard Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy, scream when he was being hurt in 1955.

The atmosphere is great-fun and hip-good service throughout-loved the cocktails, salad, and bread-but did not like the entree or side at all. Ordered sea bass at 42, and what arrived was a piece of sea bass on a plate with the skin and tail attached which was very off putting. Very little decoration or pizzaz on the plate-and why would any chef think people would want to see the carcass of their dinner? Does a steak arrive with hooves attached? Does chicken come with a beak attached? The side of mushrooms was very salty, and there were odd textures in the mix of mushrooms that just weren't appealing. Should have gone with fingerling potatoes. Credit for accomodating a vegetarian with an entree, but was charged the same price as a full meat entree for a plate of vegetables-and appeared on the bill as chicken breast-should have an appropriate charge for a vegetarian entree. The steak is probably great-but as a seldom steak eater, probably will never find out. Is this review positive or negative?

A:","completion":"A: In addition to temperature, a variety of factors can influence the phase of a substance. Some of the most significant factors include pressure, composition, and external forces. Here's a deeper look into each of these factors and how they affect a substance's phase: 1. Pressure: Pressure plays a crucial role in determining the phase of a substance. Increasing the pressure on a substance often results in a transition from the gaseous phase to the liquid phase or from the liquid phase to the solid phase. This effect can be explained by the fact that molecules in a substance are attracted to each other, and when the pressure increases, the intermolecular forces become stronger. This causes the molecules to come closer together, resulting in a more condensed phase like liquid or solid. On the other hand, decreasing the pressure often leads to a transition from the solid phase to the liquid phase or from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase. One notable example of pressure influencing the phase of a substance is the behavior of carbon dioxide. Under normal atmospheric pressure, carbon dioxide sublimates, meaning it transitions directly from a solid state (dry ice) to a gaseous state, without passing through the liquid phase. However, when the pressure is increased significantly (above 5.11 atmospheres), carbon dioxide can exist in a liquid state. 2. Composition: For mixtures or solutions, the composition of a substance, also known as its concentration, can have a significant impact on its phase. The presence of impurities, solutes, or other compounds can change the melting and boiling points of a substance by disrupting the intermolecular forces between the molecules, leading to phase transitions at different temperatures than for the pure substance. For example, adding salt to ice lowers its melting point, which is why road salts are often used to melt ice on the roads during winter. Similarly, dissolving a solute in a liquid can elevate its boiling point, as seen when adding salt to water. Interactions between different components in a mixture can also cause substances to form distinct phases, such as the separation of oil and water. 3. External Forces: The phase of a substance can also be influenced by external forces like magnetic or electric fields, radiation, and mechanical forces. For instance, applying a strong magnetic field can cause a substance to exhibit a change in its internal structure or behavior, while exposure to radiation (e.g., microwaves) can increase the molecular motion within a substance, causing it to heat up and potentially change phase. In some cases, mechanical stress or shear forces can induce phase transitions. For example, when kneading dough, the mechanical stress causes the proteins in the dough to rearrange and form gluten, giving the dough its characteristic elasticity. In summary, the phase of a substance is not solely determined by its temperature. Factors like pressure, composition, and external forces can all influence the phase behavior of a material. Understanding these factors and how they interact is vital for predicting and controlling phase transitions in various applications and industries, such as pharmaceuticals, food processing, and materials science."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was written, composed, and produced by Morissette herself, and released as the album's lead single on 8 February 2002. It is a pop rock song, featuring a shuffling, largely acoustic-rock framework. Lyrically, \\"Hands Clean\\" caused controversy, since it is reportedly the singers recollection of a forbidden sexual relationship she shared with a much older man when she was approximately 14 years of age. - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Alanis Nadine Morissette (born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian-American alternative rock singer-songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and actress. Morissette began her career in Canada in the early 1990s, with two commercially successful dance-pop albums. Afterwards, she moved to Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, and in 1995 released \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", a more rock-oriented album which sold more than 33 million units globally and is her most critically acclaimed work. Her following album, \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\", was released in 1998. - \\"Precious Illusions\\" is a song written, recorded and produced by Alanis Morissette, for her fifth album \\"Under Rug Swept\\" (2002). It released as the album's second and final international single on 5 August 2002. Its lyrics describe a conflict between idealism and realism, and its protagonist refers to her childhood fancies as \\"precious illusions\\" that she has distanced herself from with a feeling that reminds her of \\"parting with an imaginary friend\\". - Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions. - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Under Rug Swept is the fifth studio album and third internationally released album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Released by Maverick Records in the United States on February 26, 2002 and in the United Kingdom a day earlier (see 2002 in music), it was the first album Morissette had written and produced all on her own. It debuted at number one on charts in 12 countries, including the United States and Canada, and produced the singles \\"Hands Clean\\" and \\"Precious Illusions\\". Sales, however, did not match those of Morissette's previous two studio albums. - Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth studio album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - \`\` Utopia '' is a pop rock song written by Alanis Morissette , and produced by her for her fifth album , Under Rug Swept ( 2002 ) . - Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and international debut album by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, first released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records. Morissette had released two successful albums in Canada, after which she left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch. Morissette began work on her next album after moving from her hometown, Ottawa, to Toronto; she did not make much progress until she traveled to Los Angeles, where she met Glen Ballard. Morissette and Ballard had an instant connection, and began co-writing and experimenting with sounds.

In February, we want to know who you think is the greatest classical composer. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The Greatest Artists of Dance and Music: Margot Fonteyn, Ken Swift, Suzanne Farrell, and an Upcoming Vote for the Greatest Classical Composer Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to talk about some amazing people who dance beautifully and a big question about classical music. Are you ready? Let's go! First, let's talk about Margot Fonteyn. She was a super-duper famous dancer in the 1900s. People loved to watch her dance because she was so graceful and elegant, like a swan gliding on a lake. She was so fantastic at dancing that many people think of her as the most iconic dancer of the 20th century. Iconic means she was so good that everyone remembers her as the best. Now, let's meet Ken Swift and Suzanne Farrell. Just like Margot, they are also very famous dancers, and they are as amazing as her. Ken could spin on his head and do cool tricks! He was a master of a type of dance called breakdancing, which is very energetic and exciting. Kids like us enjoy it a lot! Suzanne was another excellent dancer who could spin around and make beautiful shapes with her body. She could stretch her legs and point her toes like no one else. People loved watching her dance too! These three dancers, Margot Fonteyn, Ken Swift, and Suzanne Farrell, were so wonderful that they were voted as some of the top dancers of their time. Imagine how awesome it would be to see them dance together! Now let's talk about the big question coming up in February. People want to know who we think is the greatest classical composer. A composer is someone who writes music for other people to play, and classical music is a special kind of music that has been around for a very long time. Some of these composers wrote music for orchestras to play, and it can sometimes sound fancy and beautiful. In February, we are going to have a big vote to see who is the best classical composer out there, just like we did with the dancers. It's like choosing the yummiest ice cream flavor or the funniest cartoon. But, instead of ice cream or cartoons, we're picking our favorite person who writes classical music. And that's it for today, little friends! I hope you enjoyed learning about Margot Fonteyn, Ken Swift, and Suzanne Farrell, and don't forget to think about who your favorite classical composer is. It's going to be so much fun finding out who will be voted the greatest, and maybe you'll discover a new favorite along the way!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: 1. FC Köln, manager, Peter Stöger; Peter Stöger, club, LASK Linz. Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided offers valuable information about two football clubs and their connections with the Austrian football manager, Peter Stöger. In this description, we will delve into the associations between Stöger and the clubs FC Köln (Germany) and LASK Linz (Austria). Firstly, FC Köln - also known as 1. FC Köln - is a German professional football club based in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia. This club has a rich history and tradition, having been founded in 1948 as a merger of two local clubs, Kölner BC 01 and SpVgg Sülz 07. They have played in the Bundesliga, Germany's top division, on numerous occasions. Throughout their history, FC Köln has achieved impressive accomplishments, such as winning the Bundesliga title, the German Cup, and reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. The data suggests that during a period in their history, Peter Stöger was appointed as the manager of FC Köln. Peter Stöger is an Austrian football manager and former professional player who was born on April 11, 1966, in Vienna, Austria. During his playing career, Stöger earned several caps for the Austrian national team and played as a midfielder. He transitioned to becoming a football manager when his playing days were over, coaching several clubs in both Austria and Germany. According to the data, Stöger's tenure as FC Köln's manager had a significant impact on the team. Under his guidance, the club experienced a resurgence and improved performance, likely instilling an organized and disciplined approach to their tactics and playing style, typical of Stöger's management philosophy. His time at FC Köln would certainly contribute to his reputation as a well-regarded and resourceful football manager. The second part of the data revolves around Peter Stöger's association with another football club - LASK Linz. LASK Linz is an Austrian professional football club based in Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. The club was founded in 1908 and has a rich history as well, being one of Austria's most successful clubs, having won the Austrian Bundesliga title and the Austrian Cup multiple times. LASK Linz is known for producing talented players and has been a strong competitor in Austrian football for many years. Peter Stöger's connection with LASK Linz is stated in the data, although it does not specify if it entails a past managerial position or a potential appointment in the future. Nevertheless, one can assume that his association with the club would create an exciting prospect for LASK Linz, with the opportunity of tapping into Stöger's vast experience and knowledge in football management. It's possible that Stöger's tactical approach, discipline, and emphasis on teamwork could be applied to LASK Linz, leading the team to achieve significant results on the pitch and perhaps even bringing in silverware. In conclusion, the data provided illustrates prominent Austrian football manager Peter Stöger's connections with two football clubs: FC Köln in Germany and LASK Linz in Austria. Through his tactical approach and disciplined management style, it can be assumed that Stöger has had a positive impact on the development and performance of these clubs, further enhancing his reputation within the world of football."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

These differences continue into adult life,she says.In public conversations,men talk most and interrupt other speakers more.In private conversations,men and women speak in equal amounts--although they say things in a different style.Professor Tannen believes that,for women,private talking is a way to establish and test intimacy(,).For men,private talking is a way to explore the power structure of a relationship. Teaching is one job where the differences between men's and women's ways of talking show.When a man teaches a woman,says Professor Tannen,he wants to show that he has more knowledge,and hence(,)more power in conversation.When a woman teaches another woman,however,she is more likely to take a sharing approach and to encourage her student to join in. But Professor Tannen does not believe that women are naturally more helpful.She says women feel they achieve power by being able to help others.Although the research suggests men talk and interrupt people more than women,Professor Tannen says,women actually encourage this to happen because they believe it will lead to more intimacy and help to establish a relationship.

It was released in the United States on 6 November 2015. It became the second James Bond film to be screened in IMAX venues after Skyfall, although it was not filmed with IMAX cameras. Spectre received mixed reviews upon its release; although criticised for its length, lack of screen time for new characters, and writing, it received praise for its action sequences and cinematography. The theme song, \\"Writing's on the Wall\\", received mixed reviews, particularly compared to the previous theme; nevertheless, it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song and was nominated for the Academy Award in the same category. As of 20 February 2016[update], Spectre has grossed over 879 million worldwide. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

The Group of 20 (G-20) is an international forum comprised of 19 countries and the European Union, representing the world's largest economies. The G-20 plays a vital role in addressing global challenges such as poverty, financial stability, and climate change. In this context, it is crucial for the G-20 to offer a vision that can effectively tackle these issues and create a better world for all. To quell global fears, the G-20 must develop a comprehensive and far-reaching strategy that addresses the root causes of the world's most pressing problems. This strategy must involve coordinated efforts to tackle economic inequality, promote sustainable development, and foster international cooperation on matters of shared concern. One of the most urgent issues to be addressed is the rising poverty and inequality observed in many parts of the world. According to the World Bank, approximately 9.2% of the world's population still lives in extreme poverty, earning less than 1.90 per day. Ensuring that economic growth is inclusive and benefits all citizens is essential for global stability and prosperity. The G-20 must design bold actions to protect the most vulnerable populations, like the desperately poor. This can be achieved by promoting pro-poor policies, increasing access to essential services such as health, education, and social protection, and implementing targeted poverty alleviation programs. Guiding the cooperative decision-making of the world's economic authorities is another critical role of the G-20. Enhanced policy coordination can lead to more effective actions and faster progress at the global level. The G-20 must work closely with other international organizations like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank to design and implement policies that have the maximum positive impact on poverty reduction and overall development. In summary, the G-20 must take action to offer a compelling vision to quell global fears and protect the most vulnerable populations. By promoting economic and social equality and fostering international cooperation, the G-20 can make a significant contribution to reducing extreme poverty and creating a more prosperous, sustainable world for all."},{"prompt":"Select from the following.

Article: My son Jack, a fourth grader, was having a hard time in getting interested in story books recently, so I offered to read the first few chapters to him. In the early pages of 'Incident at Halk Hill', a quiet little boy has a special meeting with a female badger .Soon after, another badger is caught in a steel leg trap , and the author describes in detail the pain and scare of an animal struggling to its death. We meet the cruel hunter and his ill treatment of a dog; we see the badger being skinned by the boy's father;and we experience the child's confusion when beaten by his father in anger. _ , I thought. Last night , I returned from a weekend away to find that Jack had finished the whole book on his own. \\"It was really, really good and sad, and violent,\\" he reported. \\"There was a lot of killing.\\" \\"Were there any happy parts?\\" I asked, \\"The boy's life was saved by the badger, and that was good. But then that badger got caught in a trap again and at the end it's dying, too. \\" Jack said, \\"It was so sad that I almost cried. \\" I told him that many books have made me cry, beginning with Heidi, when I was just his age, right on up to the novel I finished last week. \\"Well,\\" he admitted then, \\"I actually did cry. Reading that book just reminded me of all the sadness in the world, and it made me feel sad ,too. \\" So, I think, now he has been through the sad tone of the passage , the discovery that words on a printed page can give rise to such strong emotion ,that a book can move you right out of your own comfortable little self and into someone else's pain. Thus we come to realize that if we are to remain fully engaged in life, open to its mysteries and feel sorry towards its suffering, we indeed need stories to grab us by the neck and remind us of the sadness in the world that is not our own. Question: By writing the passage, the writer mainly wants to _ . Answer: Options are: [I] tell a story that interested his son [II] show the importance of reading stories [III] share an experience between himself and his son [IV] show how to make children interested in books A:","completion":"The writer in the passage primarily aims to [II] show the importance of reading stories and [III] share an experience between himself and his son. The article mainly depicts how the son, Jack, discovered a significant aspect of reading literature—unearthing emotions and understanding another's pain and suffering. As seen, the son was moved deeply by the narrative, which made him aware of the sadness beyond his own world. The story which was shared between the father and son becomes an instrument in attaining this emotional development. Therefore, the compelling emotions of sorrow, empathy and even tears can be evoked by seemingly simple words on a printed page. The story's importance lies not just in its plot but in its power to stir feelings, draw readers out of their comfort zones, and immerse them in characters' lives, something they may otherwise never experience first-hand. The author also successfully encourages the interest of his son in reading by sharing this story - a testament to the power a story can hold in making us understand different aspects of life and feel emotions they otherwise might not experience. However, suggesting ways to pique children's interest in books is not the central point the author seeks to make. These elements combined constitute an exploration of an intimate, shared experience between father and son that serves to emphasize the profound, emotional impact literature can have on its readers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business. That's 8% of the 137,000 workers who lost their offices or access to them when the Twin Towers collapsed. Legal Aid's 450 displaced attorneys and staffers have spent the past 12 months spread among previously unused spaces-some unused for good reason-in the nonprofit's other offices. It could be another year and a half before they return to their old desks. They have contended with difficult working conditions as demand for Legal Aid's services is on the rise because of Sept. 11 and the deteriorating economy.

Firstly, I will read and understand the sentence. The sentence is \\"The total weight of the valves 39239 kg\\", which is about some valves with a significant total weight. There is missing punctuation that discombobulates the sentence. Here's the sentence with punctuation inserted: \\"The total weight of the valves is 39,239 kg.\\" Now, let me justify the steps and changes I've made: 1. I have added 'is' after the word 'valves' and before the weight figure. This is necessary to construct a proper sentence as it provides a verb to link the subject and its complement, making the sentence structurally correct. 2. I have added a comma in the figure '39239'. In English, long numbers are often separated by comma after each group of three digits from the right. So it becomes '39,239'. It is mainly done for easier readability. 3. I have ended the sentence with a full stop.

What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the growth and fall of passenger numbers at different airports in Northern Ireland in the year 2015. The article presents data regarding the increase in passenger count for both Belfast International Airport and George Best Belfast City Airport, while shedding light on the decline in numbers at the City of Derry Airport. At Belfast International, passenger numbers increased by 8.9% to almost 4.4 million. One key driver behind this growth was attributed to the successful operations of a new KLM service to Amsterdam, making 2015 a record-year for the airport. Moreover, the airport is expected to witness another notable increase in the subsequent year due to the introduction of a new base of operations by low-cost carrier Ryanair. George Best Belfast City Airport also observed a surge of passengers by 5.4% to nearly 2.7 million. The article didn't specifically allude to any specific reasons for the rise of passenger numbers at this airport; however, the growth signifies a positive trend for the aviation sector in the region. On the contrasting end, the City of Derry Airport experienced a slump in passenger counts, witnessing a decrease by 18.8% to around 284,000 in 2015. The article doesn't provide explicit reasons for this decline. Additionally, the article highlights Ryanair's plans for further expanding its network: starting flights from Belfast to London's Gatwick Airport in March.

Summarize this article in one sentence. . The savior and white knight often jumps from relationship to relationship, “rescuing” the helpless or damaged. If this describes you, it may be time to take a hiatus from relationships. If you are not in a long-term or committed relationship, take some time to enjoy being single and nurturing your own needs. Spending some time single can help you gain more awareness into your compulsive helping/rescuing tendencies. It can also give you time to explore the parts of yourself that trigger this habit. You may want to set an amount of time that you remain single to help you keep this goal. For example, you might want to give yourself six months. During this time, set goals for your self-improvement. Compulsive helpers often allow their efforts to fix others to prevent them from doing any personal development of their own. What’s more, by viewing yourself as a savior you develop unrealistic goals that eventually wear away at your self-esteem. By creating realistic goals, you can rebuild. Select a goal for yourself that allows you to focus only on you. This might include anything from losing weight to writing a novel. Make it a SMART goal, which is specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. You might say, “I want to lose 15 pounds in 10 weeks.” Then, map out how you will achieve this goal: “I will eat a serving of vegetables at every meal. I will exercise 5 days per week. I will drink only water.” Run through your goals with another person. They may be able to tell if you if the goals are realistic or not. They may also be able to give you ideas to achieve your goals. Individuals with a savior complex frequently dedicate all their time and energy to others, placing them in dire need of self-care. Balance your excessive helping of others by doing something nice for yourself. Create a routine that includes various nurturing activities. You might create a soothing nighttime ritual to help you sleep better. Adopt a new exercise habit such as running or yoga. Get your hair or nails done weekly. Or, simply run a warm bath and listen to relaxing music. Pour back into yourself. Ask a friend or family member to be an accountability partner. This is a person who will check in and make sure you're following through with your self-care. Ask them to check in with you often.

A:","completion":"\\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" is a book by Spencer Johnson that uses a parable to teach valuable lessons about dealing with change in work and life. The story revolves around four characters—two mice, Sniff and Scurry, and two “little-people,” Hem and Haw—living in a maze, in search of cheese, which represents happiness and success. The mice have a simple strategy for finding cheese: they sniff out the location, and scurry toward it to enjoy the prize. Hem and Haw, on the other hand, are more complex and tend to overthink their search for cheese. At first, all four characters come across a large supply of cheese, but eventually, the supply dwindles, and the cheese disappears. This forces everyone to adapt and search for new cheese. Sniff and Scurry quickly accept the change and begin exploring the maze for a new source without much difficulty. However, Hem and Haw struggle to adapt, with Hem refusing to let go of the old situation and Haw initially hesitant but ultimately embracing the change. Throughout the story, Haw learns important lessons about change—how to accept it, embrace it, and grow from it—while Hem remains stuck in the past. The key takeaway from the book is the importance of being flexible, adapting to change, and moving forward in life instead of dwelling on past setbacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the below context: Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\".... Guess a valid title for it!

What kind of thing would the answer to the question \\"What is tumbled marble ?\\" be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What is tumbled marble?\\" would be a description. Tumbled marble refers to marble that has been through a process called \\"tumbling\\" to achieve a weathered, antique finish. The process consists basically of putting the marble pieces into a machine that uses sand, small rocks, and water to create friction on the surface of the pieces. As the marble pieces grind against one another within the tumbling machine, their sharp edges and corners are knocked off, and the surface of the stone develops a kind of pitted, softened texture and an aged, antique look. The resulting tumbled marble tiles showcase a muted, less polished appearance than their regular counterparts, adding a unique, old-world charm to any space where they're installed. They are often used in decorative backsplashes, shower interiors, floor tiles, and outdoor spaces. However, it's important to note that while tumbled marble has a unique, rustic aesthetic appeal, this finish does make the stone more porous. Therefore, tumbled marble usually needs to be sealed to prevent damage from water and stains. In the context of stone finishing, tumbling does not only apply to marble. Many other stones like granite, travertine, or limestone can also be tumbled for a more rustic and antique finish. To sum up, when one asks \\"What is tumbled marble?\\" the answer should provide a detailed description of what tumbled marble is, the process through which it is created, and its applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The drugs were given to prevent the children from getting sick in order to boost attendance, the news agency reported. The schools get paid based on attendance. The scandal started last week in one kindergarten in the city of Xi'an and has now spread to several in the country, prompting China's education and health ministries to require its local branches to check all kindergartens and primary schools for illegally administered drugs, according to the Global Times newspaper. Almost 2,000 children who attended the suspected kindergartens are receiving medical attention as some reported side effects from the medication, such as dizziness, stomachaches, leg pains and genital swelling, Xinhua said. In an article Tuesday, state media called it a \\"crisis of confidence in kindergarten managers.\\" It said that many parents are fed up with private kindergartens \\"which are poorly funded, poorly managed and frequently in a bad state of repair.\\" China's preschools have been riddled with what the state media called \\"a long history of avoidable problems\\" such as food safety and physical abuse. Some angry parents of the affected kindergartens rallied in front of the facilities and local government buildings. First incidents. Last week, Xinhua reported that a parent accused a kindergarten in Xi'an, in Shaanxi province of administering an antiviral drug to children. One parent told the Global Times that several kindergarteners had been complaining about stomachaches or night sweats. When their parents took them to the doctors, they found abnormal results in urine and blood tests -- traces of possible damage to the kidney or liver, the parent told Chinese media. The doctors were stumped over the diagnosis. Local authorities said that the administrators at the Fengyun Lanwan Kindergarten had given children moroxydine ABOB, a medicine which can cause side effects such as sweating, loss of appetite and hypoglycemia since 2008. The prescription drug is used to treat the flu. \\"Teachers told my child the pill was good for him but should be kept secret,\\" one parent, identified as Zhang told Xinhua. \\"They have been taking it for nearly three years.\\" Another kindergarten in Xi'an, called Hongji Xincheng has also been suspected of following the same practice, Xinhua said. Together, the two kindergartens have 1,455 students. Little known about drug in question. Dr. Nelson Lee, professor of infectious diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said not much is known about moroxydine ABOB. The drug was produced in the 1950s and could have some antiviral effects such as suppressing the flu virus, but there are no reports or clinical trials in English.This means doctors know little about how helpful or harmful it could be. For kindergartens to administer such a drug with little research or data is something Lee said he has never heard of. \\"I think the most effective, suitable way to prevent flu infection is to ask the students to get flu vaccines every year. It's the proven, safest way to prevent flu, rather than taking long-term medication with unknown side effects and efficacy.\\" Similar incident in Jilin province. Days later, another kindergarten came under scrutiny, this time in the northeastern province of Jilin. Investigators told Xinhua that a branch of the Fanglin Kindergarten in Jilin City had given some children the same drug -- moroxydine ABOB -- to prevent them from catching colds and infectious diseases. The kindergarten staff were reported to have said they were using the drug to improve attendance. Three administrators have been arrested, according to Xinhua. The kindergarten's 375 students are getting checked at hospitals, it reported. Latest incident in Hubei province.

Passage: Wheeler established a new archaeological journal, Ancient India, planning for it to be published twice a year. He had trouble securing printing paper and faced various delays; the first issue was released in January 1946, and he would release three further volumes during his stay. Wheeler married Kim Collingridge in Simla, before he and his wife took part in an Indian Cultural Mission to Iran. The Indian government had deemed Wheeler ideal to lead the group, which departed via train to Zahidan before visiting Persepolis, Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Pasargadae, and Kashan. Wheeler enjoyed the trip, and was envious of Tehran's archaeological museum and library, which was far in advance of anything then found in India. Crossing into Iraq, in Baghdad the team caught a flight back to Delhi. In 1946, he was involved in a second cultural mission, this time to Afghanistan, where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient Bactria and visited the archaeology of Balkh.Wheeler was present during the 1947 Partition of India into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Union of India and the accompanying ethnic violence between Hindu and Muslim communities. He was unhappy with how these events had affected the Archaeological Survey, complaining that some of his finest students and staff were now citizens of Pakistan and no longer able to work for him. He was based in New Delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence, and attempted to help many of his Muslim staff members escape from the Hindu-majority city unharmed. He further helped smuggle Muslim families out of the city hospital, where they had taken refuge from a violent Hindu mob. As India neared independence from the British Empire, the political situation had changed significantly; by October 1947 he was one of the last British individuals in a high-up position within the country's governing establishment, and recognised that many Indian nationalists wanted him to also leave.As their relationship had become increasingly strained, his wife had left and returned to Britain. Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, he was concerned for his economic prospects, and desperately searched for a new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed to take up a chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three.","completion":"1.

If a student starts to get violently angry, your first priority is to keep the other students safe. If there is bullying going on in your classroom, learn strategies to stop bullying. You might think about dismissing the class early if the situation escalates. Don’t engage with the student until he has calmed down. Remain calm yourself, and don’t take sides. It may be a natural move to put your hand on the student’s shoulder to try calming them down. But when someone is angry, it is sometimes unclear what they may do in response. Maintain your distance from the student. If the situation has escalated, ask another student to get help. Having another teacher or person of authority may help diffuse the situation and can give you support. If there is a troublesome incident, such as a violent or excessively angry student, you should keep a record of what happened. Immediately after the incident occurs, write down what happened. Include details about what happened, when it happened, the names of those involved, and so on. Give a copy of this account to your administration. Also keep a copy in case a parent wants to see it. If the incident was severe, you or your principal will likely need to contact the student’s parents. Tell them the facts about what happened. Don’t add in your opinions. Stick to the facts. Use the conflict as a teachable moment.

That's the take off point for Buddha Mar Gaya - a black comedy about dead bodies, mucho moolah and funerals. Laxmikant Kabadiya aka LK (Anupam Kher), is one of India's richest industrialists, a self made man who's risen from selling scrap to become a construction magnate. His conglomerate is on the verge of a 5000 crore IPO that should make them one of the largest companies in the country. LK's family - comprising of his spinster twin sister Prerna, his two sons Ranjeet and Sameer, their wives Shruti and Anju respectively and Ranjeet's daughters Sanjana and Namrata, and Sameer's son, Pawan, can't stop salivating at the thought of all that money. Unfortunately for all of them fate displays a wicked sense of humour. On the night before the IPO opens, LK dies. The family is distraught and horrified. Not because a loved one has died but because now no one will buy their shares. So, on the advice of their family guru - Vidyut Baba (Om Puri), the family decides to hide the death of LK for a period of two days till the shares are all sold out. Little do they realize the crazy series of events that will follow on account of this duplicity. After all, hiding the death of a man as famous as LK, is a Herculean task. To make matters worse, every time they're ready to announce LK's death, fate intervenes forcing them to keep his death hidden for another couple of days. Which results in them having to announce the death of a fictitious friend or relative of LK's... And stage fake funerals. Which of course means generating dead bodies and worse, getting the dead LK to make appearances at these funerals. Complicating matters further are an inquisitive and greedy servant, the Prime Minister's fixer, a procurer of dead bodies, the paparazzi and for good measure a couple of cops.

Please add spaces between words: Galatians6:2–Bearoneanother’sburdens","completion":"Galatians 6:2 – Bear one another's burdens In this Bible verse from the New Testament, the Apostle Paul is writing to the Christian community in the region of Galatia. This verse is taken from the Letter to the Galatians, which is his final message in an expression of concern, correction, and guidance for the fellow Christians that lived there. The passage is as follows: \\"Galatians 6:2 – Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\\" In this verse, Paul is encouraging the followers of Jesus Christ to support and help one another by sharing each other's struggles and burdens. This is important for maintaining and strengthening the collective unity, love and fellowship within the community, both in faith and in daily life. There are a few key elements that we can take from this verse: 1. Bear one another's burdens: Paul is saying that as Christians, we should assist and be empathetic to our fellow believers when they struggle or face difficulties. This can include physical, emotional or spiritual support. By sharing the weight of the burden with someone else, it can feel lighter and easier to carry, providing a sense of comfort, relief and solidarity. 2. Fulfill the law of Christ: By helping others and showing love and compassion, we are fulfilling the words and teachings of Jesus Christ, who emphasized the importance of love for God, and love for our neighbors as ourselves. The \\"law of Christ\\" refers to the commandments and teachings given by Jesus in the Bible, which center around loving and serving others selflessly. 3. Importance of community and unity: The ability to share and bear the burdens of others requires strong relationships and connections between individuals. This verse illustrates the significance of fostering a community that is built upon mutual love, support and understanding – a community that is based on the principles of Jesus Christ. In conclusion, the verse Galatians 6:2 - \\"Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ,\\" is a powerful reminder for all Christians to actively practice empathy, love, and support within their communities. By doing so, they not only become a true reflection of Jesus Christ's teachings but also help in building a cohesive and strong spiritual community, bound together by love and service to each other."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the character who has lost the will to live? ?

In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles. Charles persuades the khedive to accept Myers' cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to Clarissa.

Summarize the following: Most insects hate the smell of these plants, and bed bugs are no exception. You can use these herbs fresh or dried. Here area few ideas on how you can use eucalyptus, lavender, mint, and rosemary to ward off bed bugs: Tie up bundles of these herbs, and hang them in your wardrobe. Place sachets containing these herbs in your dresser and linen closet. The essential oils that work the best on bed bugs include: citronella, eucalyptus, lavender, mint, and rosemary. Note that if you have pets, you should use tea tree oil with care, as it can be toxic to them. Listed below are a few ways you can use essential oils to get rid of bed bugs: Rub some essential oil onto your bed frame. Add a few drops of essential oil into your laundry the next time you wash your bedding. Make a simple spray by adding a few drops essential oil into a spray bottle filled with ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water. Use this spray on your bedding, carpet, and linens. Diatomaceous earth is made from diatoms. It appears like a powder, but to bed bugs, it is like shattered glass. It not only kills bed bugs, but keeps them out. While pesticide grade diatomaceous earth is considered safe for humans and animals, you would not want to eat it or breathe it in. Avoid getting pool or food grade diatomaceous earth. The grains are too fine, and can be harmful for you. Find 8 to 10 dryer sheets, and place them between the box spring and the mattress. Place 8 to 10 more of these sheets on the mattress underneath your bed sheets. The strong smell of the dryer sheets will send the bedbugs scurrying. Consider stuffing a dryer sheet or two inside your pillow case, dresser drawers, and linen closet. Bed bugs seem to hate the smell of lavender in particular. Consider using some lavender-scented dryer sheets. These covers are special, because they don't have any seams and other crannies for the bed bugs to hide out in. They are also easy to wash, and keep bed bugs from infesting your pillows and mattress. They will keep the bed bugs from crawling onto your bed. If you can't find any, get some plastic bowls or dishes, and place them beneath all four feet of your bed. Fill them with some soapy water to drown any bed bugs who dare climb up your bed.","completion":"Insects, including bed bugs, generally dislike the smell of eucalyptus, lavender, mint, and rosemary.

Philadelphia (CNN) -- A Philadelphia abortion provider found guilty of first-degree murder has agreed give up his right to appeal in exchange for avoiding a possible death sentence, Philadelphia's district attorney's office announced Tuesday. Dr. Kermit Gosnell, 72, was convicted Monday on three counts of murder for killing babies by cutting their spinal cords with scissors. The next step in the case was to have been the penalty phase, when jurors would have weighed whether to give Gosnell a death sentence. The arrangement erases a need for that phase. \\"Like any deal, there's a give and take on each side. The Commonwealth (of Pennsylvania) took away the death penalty and Dr. Gosnell gave up his right to appeal,\\" said defense attorney Jack McMahon. In","completion":"addition to the three counts of murder, Gosnell was also found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the overdose death of a patient and more than 200 counts of violating Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act. He has been sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without parole for the murder convictions, as well as additional time for the other charges, ensuring that he will spend the rest of his life behind bars. Following the high-profile trial, the case has sparked a nationwide debate on abortion and clinic regulations. Critics argue that Gosnell's clinic, the Women's Medical Society, had not been inspected by state health officials in over a decade, which allowed the unsafe and illegal practices to continue. Pro-choice advocates claim that excessive regulation and restricted access to safe abortion services lead women to seek out clinics like Gosnell's out of desperation. In response to the case, Pennsylvania legislators have introduced new laws aimed at increasing oversight and improving safety standards at abortion clinics across the state. In the wake of the Gosnell case, other states are also taking a closer look at their abortion clinic regulations. While some states continue to push for tighter restrictions on abortion access, others are strengthening clinic oversight and safety protocols to prevent similar tragedies from occurring. Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate hope that the Gosnell case will lead to positive change and increased vigilance when it comes to women's reproductive health. As the nation grapples with the fallout from the Gosnell case and ensuing political debates, it's essential to recognize that reproductive health is a complex issue with profound consequences for both women and society as a whole. The Gosnell case has exposed the importance of balancing the need for safe, legal, and accessible abortion services with the responsibility to protect those who seek them from harm. While opponents and proponents of abortion rights will likely continue to disagree on the issue, it is crucial to remember that the safety and well-being of women seeking reproductive healthcare should always be a top priority. The ramifications of the Gosnell case will likely reverberate through the legal system, political arena, and the lives of countless women for years to come. It is up to policymakers, healthcare professionals, and citizens alike to strive for a more informed, compassionate, and proactive approach to reproductive health in America."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. What is an answer for this question: Which continent killed less plankton? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background information, Small continent has been more protective towards the environment and used fewer air polluting substances compared to Big continent. Big continent, on the other hand, experienced a hole in its ozone layer due to their actions, leading to ozone depletion, higher UV radiation levels, and the subsequent disturbance in the nitrogen cycle and killing of plankton. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Small continent killed less plankton than Big continent, as it contributed less to ozone depletion and the associated negative impact on the environment and life forms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: You've heard it repeatedly: Make sure you drink at least eight glasses of water per day. The key words are \\"at least\\", because, unless you are a child, you need more water than that. The rule is, for every 50 pounds of body weight you carry, drink one quart of bottled or filtered water per day. The average person weighs 150 pounds, so they should drink three quarts per day. A 200 pounds person should drink a full gallon per day. Athletes should drink even more than that. Follow these and you've adopted one of the most important health habits. Our bodies are mostly water, and water is essential to our every function. Drink the appropriate amount, and everything is much more likely to function at the best levels. If you don't drink enough water, over the short term you will experience tiredness, dry skin, headaches and constipation ; over the longer term, every body function will _ more quickly. It really is as simple as that. Things get a bit more complicated in what type of water to drink. Bottled water and filtered water are both good options. Do not drink tap water or distilled water .Bottled water should be bottled in clear glass containers, not the plastic containers that transfer far too many chemicals into the water. Filtered water can be obtained through low-cost filters. Tap water should be avoided because it contains chlorine and may contain fluoride , which is poisonous and can have terrible consequences for the body. Distilled water should also be avoided because it can burn up your body of necessary minerals. It has been tied to hair loss, which is often associated with certain mineral lack. Finally, drink water at room temperature if possible, as ice-cold water can harm your stomach. Answer:","completion":"Question: According to the article, how much water should a person weighing 150 pounds drink per day? A) One quart B) Two quarts C) Three quarts D) A full gallon Explanation of the Answer: The article clearly states that \\"for every 50 pounds of body weight you carry, drink one quart of bottled or filtered water per day.\\" Going by this rule, a person who weighs 150 pounds should drink three quarts of water each day.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Divide the batter equally among three bowls. For the first batch of batter, add a few drops of red food coloring or edible gel paste to the bowl and stir with a clean spoon until the color is fully incorporated. Add more color as necessary to achieve the desired intensity. Repeat with the blue and yellow food coloring. You can actually use any colors you like for tie-dye cupcakes, and can also use more than just three colors. Be sure to use a fresh bowl and a fresh spoon for each batch of colored batter, otherwise the colors will become muddy. You can also mix and match food coloring to achieve different colors. For instance, you can mix blue and red to achieve purple. To have white in your mix, leave one of the bowls of batter uncolored. Prepare a cupcake tin by lining it with white cupcake liners. Into the bottom of each liner, drop 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of red batter. Then place one or two spoons of yellow batter on top of that, followed by an equal quantity of blue batter on top. Stop when the liners are filled half way. You can layer the colors in any way you like, and don’t have to use the red, yellow, blue pattern. different spoons for each color. If you're using more colors, use ½ to 1 tablespoon (7.5 to 15 ml) of batter for each color. Instead of spooning the colors into the liners, you can also transfer each batter color to a separate pastry bag, and pipe in the batters one color at a time. To create the tie-dye effect, take a clean toothpick and gently swirl around the batter in each liner. Don’t mix too much, or you will end up blending the colors and they’ll become muddy. You can create circular tie-dye patterns by swirling the toothpick in circles. Create wavy patterns by zig zagging the toothpick in the batter. Make tie-dye spikes by dipping the toothpick into the batter in a few places and pulling it straight out. This will lift the bottom batter colors to the top.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It was the end of the school term and my son Tom had less than three months left before he would finish his six years at high school. During this time he had developed a love for basketball. Sadly, because of my work over the last twelve months, I had only been able to attend a few of his games; however, I was determined to get to his last game for the school term. Tom's team came out in the first 10 minutes with a burst of goals that saw them leading by just over 20 points at the end of the first half. The second half changed as the other team quickly played themselves back into the game. Tom's team started to miss an increasing number of shots. It was at that point that the coach called his first time out. The noise of the spectators became quiet as the coach spoke to them. He had the team standing in a half circle, but he squatted down, looking up at them and fiving some very calm and clear instructions on what they needed to do in the last couple of minutes. As he stood up to allow the team to return to the court, I saw him give some further words of encouragement to all of them. You could see that he knew that the team was fighting to save the game and that he needed to lift them up. By squatting down he placed himself in a position where he was talking up to them, rather than down or at them, and as the players went back onto the court his words of encouragement served to lift their energy and spirits. Well, Tom's team went on to win the final by 5 points. As I drove away I thought about what can happen to us all in our everyday life. One of my favourite quotes is about the half filled glass of water --- \\"Is it half full or is it half empty?\\" Like the coach, the answer to this quote all depends on how you look at things. Options: A Because his son would graduate from high school. B Because he felt sorry for never watching his son play. C Because it was a final his son played a key role in. D Because he had a strong interest in basketball himself. Answer: A Because his son would graduate from high school.

The California-based tech firm, which allows users to send images and messages that vanish within seconds, is set to be one of the major US share listings of recent years. The flotation is expected to value the business at between 20bn and 25bn, although Snap has never made a profit. It will turn the company's founders into multi-billionaires. Snap wants to raise 3bn through the share sale, a small percentage but one that will set the market price for the rest of the company. Snap's formal announcement to regulators of its plans revealed that the company made sales of 404m last year, but a loss of 515m. The documents also disclose that the shares being sold will, unusually, not carry voting rights, enabling Snap's founders to retain control. Snapchat: Is it really worth 25bn? The company began in 2011 when co-founder and chief executive, 26-year-old Evan Spiegel, was still at university. Mr Spiegel and fellow founder Bobby Murphy, 28, have stakes in Snap that would be worth about 5bn. Snap now has nearly 160 million daily users and last year revenues grew by nearly 600%, the listing documents revealed. Heavy costs, including from marketing and research, dragged Snap into even deeper losses than the 373m it lost in 2015. Snap said in the filing that it expected \\"to incur operating losses in the future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability\\". Despite the losses - and that warning - some investors see Snapchat as the next potential Facebook, said CCS Insights analyst Martin Garner. \\"If it can repeat the Facebook story to some extent, it's going to be hugely profitable,\\" he said. Most of Snapchat's revenue comes from advertising, and it is seen as an appealing way for companies to reach young people, with over half of its users aged between 13 and 24. Analysts predicted its US stock market listing would be the biggest since the launch of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014, and before that Facebook's 81bn valuation in 2012. It would also mean a big payout for Mr Spiegel, who is set to remain a major shareholder. Just over three years ago, he turned down an offer from Facebook's co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to buy Snapchat for 3bn. The company is now seeking to raise 3bn from the share sale, according to reports, valuing the company at much more. Snap names Facebook as one of several companies it is competing with for users' attention, along with Twitter and Google-owned YouTube. However, it is also seen as a fast-growing rival to those major Silicon Valley players. Under pressure from Snapchat, Facebook has launched new filters and a slideshow feature on its photo-sharing app Instagram. \\"A lot of people think Facebook is losing younger users to Snapchat. There's a lot of evidence Facebook is copying Snapchat's features,\\" Mr Garner said. But with Facebook drawing in 1.2 billion daily users, Snapchat needs to prove it can have general appeal, he added. Keen to show it can make revenue from sources other than advertising, Snapchat rebranded itself as Snap last year, and debuted its video-camera sunglasses called Spectacles. The kit can connect to smartphones and send video and photos to the app. Last month, the firm said it had established its non-US office in London. Snap said it would pay taxes on UK and some international sales through the hub. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Snap, the parent company of social media platform Snapchat, has filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, valuing the company at between 20bn and 25bn.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Vincent James Turner (born 9 October 1985), better known by his stage name Frankmusik (and between 2011 and 2012, by the name Vincent Did It), is an English synthpop musician. The name \\"Frank\\" is derived from the Christian name of his grandfather, whose name he took in tribute. - Alphabeat is a Danish pop band from Silkeborg, fronted by singers Stine Bramsen and Anders SG and signed to Polydor Records. Their single \\"Fascination\\" was a major hit in Denmark during the summer of 2007 and a significant hit in the United Kingdom in 2008. Follow-up single \\"10.000 Nights of Thunder\\" (or just \\"10,000 Nights\\" in the UK) saw equal acclaim, and their eponymous debut album reached number two in Denmark and number ten in the UK. It has sold over 100,000 copies and their three top twenty singles have sold of 400,000 altogether in the region. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Planet Funk is an Italian electronic dance musical ensemble. The group is composed of Marco Baroni, Domenico \\"GG\\" Canu, Sergio Della Monica, Alex Neri and Alex Uhlmann, in addition to guest vocalists Auli Kokko, Dan Black, Sally Doherty, Raiz, John Graham and Giuliano Sangiorgi.

The county town is Maidstone. - Independent music (often shortened to indie music or indie) is music produced independently from major commercial record labels or their subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous, do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing. The term \\"indie\\" is sometimes also used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and indie pop); as a genre term, \\"indie\\" may include music that is not independently produced, and most independent music artists do not fall into a single, defined musical style or genre, and usually create music that can be categorized into other genres. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - Giuliano Sangiorgi (born 24 January 1979 in Nardò, Lecce, Italy) is one of the leading and most eclectic young Italian artist, who has gained increasing fame both as singer, songwriter, composer and together with his rock band Negramaro. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402. - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge.

For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. - Dan Black ( born 16 November 1976 ) is a British wonky pop recording artist and record producer from London .

Write a title for this article: So much for the idea of a flattening yield curve bringing investors to the risk table. Barclays Capital warned in a 118 page report published Thursday that the global economy was heading down a treachurous path, and the prospect of free money wasn’t going to help it anytime soon. For now, the idea inside Barclays is that the U.S. will avoid a recession thanks to monetary stimulus, but volatility and deteriorating financial conditions will haunt the global economy for months, if not much of next year. The only way out of a recession in the U.S. at least seems to be the Fed, as policy makers in Washington have essentially turned the economy into a campaign fight. A bad economy is good for the Republicans, who want to beat President Obama in 2012, if the man even runs for re-election at this point. As it now stands, Ben Bernanke is leading the country. To some, Bernanke and Congresss, along with Angela Merkel in Germany, are leading the market to hell in a handbasket. The past several months have witnessed a deterioration in financial conditions that to many investors seems eerily similar to the 2008 financial crisis. Global equity markets have sold off, volatility has spiked, and investors are questioning the sustainability of debt that was once considered rock solid. The U.S. downgrade on Aug. 5 by Standard and Poor’s is a case in point. In Europe, banks are facing funding difficulties amid concerns about their exposure to unpayable government debt. This could have ramifications for big retail banks in the U.S., such as Bank of America (BAC), analysts outside of Barclays have said. The only good news is that this is not 2008. A double dip is unlikely in the U.S. A great depression, considered a possibility two years ago, is out of the question in their view. Larry Kantor, head of research at Barclays, wrote that “fortunately, markets and economies are not nearly as vulnerable to collapse as they were in 2008: valuations are far from stretched, cyclical sectors are already operating at very low levels, and households, investors and businesses including most banks have all been behaving very cautiously, with high levels of liquid assets and low levels of risk.” Nevertheless, Barclays warns that the probability of significant financial deterioration is far from negligible. Markets have been hit by two main concerns: a slowdown in the global economy and the sustainability of sovereign debt. Barclays’ view is that the latter presents the greatest risk.

It is a public school in an urban city which is quite multicultural. She is half-Chinese and half-white. Although she is part Chinese, not many people can notice. Some have thought that she is Italian or Greek or even Irish for some reason. Anyways, a month and a bit ago, my daughter came home a bit sad. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that in school, everyone shared what they did for the weekend. My daughter said that her family is Chinese so they celebrated Chinese New Year. The teacher (who is white) apparently told her “But you’re not Chinese. You shouldn’t lie.” My daughter said she felt embarassed in front of the whole class. I was amused but also angry. I phoned her teacher and VERY CASUALLY told her that my daughter felt hurt by her being dismissive of her heritage. Her teacher was strangely defensive and asked me if I was accusing her of something. I said no and just that she should try being more open minded. A few days after this incident, my daughter said she felt like the teacher was treating her unfairly, namely refusing to let her go to the water fountain during class, giving her a “time out” for not lining up in time for recess, putting her on the spot to answer a question and berating her when she had the wrong answer. This time both my husband and I booked an appt to talk with the teacher, who was quite dismissive of us and very unhelpful. At this point it was affecting my daughter’s enjoyment of school. She would cry at night and beg me to send her back to her old school. Finally I had a talk with the principal, who told me that other parents have been accusing the teacher of racism in the past and said they’re trying to work with her. In the meantime my daughter was transferred to another class which worked out great. Flash forward to last week when I was picking up my daughter from school. Her old teacher approached me and we made a bit of small talk, then she said casually, “Well Im not going to return to teach next year so I guess I can thank you.” I was super taken aback. I told her I did NOT mean for her to lose her job. She then walked away from me. I also learned from another parent that she was 4 kids and is a single mom. This made me extremely sad and I can’t help but feel guilty for playing a role in having her fired. My husband told me she was probably gonna get fired anyways and said I shouldn’t feel bad. AITA though? I feel so so horrible knowing that she cannot support her 4 kids anymore partially because of my complaint against her.","completion":"To complete this task, follow these steps: 1.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The correlation coefficient can be understood as an indicator of two things. The first is whether or not the two variables in question typically move in the same direction at the same time. If they do, the correlation coefficient is positive. If not, it is negative. The second thing the correlation coefficient can tell you is how similar these movements are. A correlation coefficient close of 1 or -1 represents perfect positive correlation or perfect negative correlation, respectively. Correlation coefficients always vary between 1 and -1. A result of 0 indicates that there is no correlation. So, for example, the example result of 0.809 from the other part of this article would mean that stocks X and Y are highly correlated. The two securities experience price movements in the same direction and usually in roughly the same magnitude. The primary use of stock correlation coefficients is in the preparation of balanced securities portfolios. Stocks or other assets within a portfolio can be assessed against others in the same portfolio to determine the correlation coefficient between them. The goal is to place stocks with low or negative correlations in the same portfolio. Thus, when the price of the first stock moves, the second will likely move oppositely or independently of the first. The result of these actions is effective portfolio diversification. This practice reduces \\"unsystematic risk,\\" which is risk inherent to individual securities. The correlation coefficient is also frequently used to assess relationships between other data sets, such as mutual fund returns, Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) returns, and market indexes. Correlations coefficients can be calculated between these data sets and stock returns to diversify a portfolio or to figure out how a stock's price moves in relation to other market shifts. This can be useful for predicting the change in a stock's price that would occur in the event of another change in the market. For example, the stock price of a gold mining company might be positively related to the price of gold (with a high, positive correlation coefficient). If the price of gold is expected to increase, an investor would have reason to believe that the price of the company's stock will as well. of stock return data to obtain a 'scatter plot'. You can use a spreadsheet program to plot the dates and returns of your stocks. This makes it easier to note the properties of the data. Also, using spreadsheet software, you can plot a best fit line. The best fit line to the data is called the regression line. On Excel, you can add this line by clicking \\"Chart\\" and then \\"Add Trendline.\\" The program will then calculate a trend line based on your data. The correlation coefficient is a measure of how closely the two stock returns fit the regression line. That is, how closely the return values satisfy a linear relation such as Y = βX + α for some constants α and β.","completion":"The correlation coefficient helps us understand if two things move in the same direction and how similar their movements are, which can be useful for making a balanced portfolio of stocks with low or negative correlations for diversification and reduced risk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Based on the statistics reported in the passage, it can be inferred that what demographic was most strongly affected by the smog? Context: A dense wave of smog began in the Central and Eastern part of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \\"severely polluted\\" for five straight days and \\"heavily polluted\\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in North China region. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

Given the question: Information: - Bloomsbury is an area in the West End, central London, forming part of the London Borough of Camden and located between Euston Road and Holborn. It was developed by the Russell family in the 17th and 18th centuries into a fashionable residential area. It is notable for its array of garden squares, literary connections (exemplified by the Bloomsbury Group), and numerous cultural, educational and health-care institutions. Although Bloomsbury was not the first area of London to have acquired a formal square, Bloomsbury Square, laid out in 1660 by Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, as Southampton Square was the first square to be named as such. Much of the district was planned and built by James Burton. - Herodotus (\\"Hródotos\\") was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC (484 425 BC), a contemporary of Socrates. He is widely referred to as \\"The Father of History\\" (first conferred by Cicero); he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \\"The Histories\\" is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \\"inquiry\\" (or \\"historía\\") on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate; yet he states that he was reporting only what was told to him and was often correct in his information. Despite Herodotus' historical significance, little is known of his personal history. - Assyria was a major Mesopotamian East Semitic-speaking kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East. It existed as an independent state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC in the form of the Assur city-state, until its lapse between 612 BC and 599 BC, spanning the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age. - Reign. Astyages succeeded his father in 585 BCE, following the Battle of Halys, which ended a five-year war between the Lydians and the Medes. He inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, Croesus of Lydia and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whose wife, Amytis, Astyages' sister, was the queen for whom Nebuchadnezzar was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. but due to the recent evidence, the garden was likely built by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. Married to Aryenis, the sister of King Croesus of Lydia, to seal the treaty between the two empires, Astyages ascended to the Median throne upon his father's death later that year. - Rusa II was king of Urartu between around 680 BC and 639 BC. It was during his reign that the massive fortress complex, Karmir-Blur, was constructed. - Cyaxares (\\"Uvaxštra\\", , ; r. 625585 BC), the son of King Phraortes, and according to Herodotus was the third and most capable king of Media. According to Herodotus, Cyaxares, grandson of Deioces, had a far greater military reputation than his father or grandfather. He was the first to divide his troops into separate sections of spearmen, archers, and horsemen. - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. - Rusa III was king of Urartu . He was called \`\` Son of Erimena , '' meaning that he was probably a brother of Rusa II. Little is known about his reign ; his name was inscribed on a massive granary at Armavir and on a series of bronze shields from the temple of Khaldi found at Rusahinili , now held in the British Museum . According to the Armenian historian Moses of Chorene , Rusa 's father Erimena can probably be identified with Paruyr Skayordi , who helped the Median king Cyaxares to conquer Assyria , for which Cyaxares recognized him as the king of Armenia , although the Medes ultimately reneged on this ; significantly later , during the reign of King Astyages , the Medes conquered and annexed Armenia . Rusa was the father of Sarduri IV. - Aššur (Akkadian; 'shr; : shr : shr, Kurdish Asûr), also known as Ashur and Qal'at Sherqat, was an Assyrian city, capital of the Old Assyrian Empire (20251750 BC), Middle Assyrian Empire (13651050 BC), and for a time, the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911605 BC). The remains of the city are situated on the western bank of the Tigris River, north of the confluence with the tributary Little Zab River, in modern-day Iraq, more precisely in the Al-Shirqat District in the Saladin Governorate. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history. - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south.

It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - Urartu, also known as Kingdom of Van (Urartian: ' Assyrian: '; Babylonian: \\"Urashtu\\"), was an Iron Age kingdom centred on Lake Van in the Armenian Highlands. It corresponds to the biblical \\"Kingdom of Ararat\\". - The Medes (Old Persian \\"\\", ) were an ancient Iranian people who lived in an area known as Media (northwestern Iran) and who spoke the Median language. They mainly inhabited the mountainous area of northwestern Iran and the northeastern and eastern region of Mesopotamia and located in the Kermanshah-Hamadan (Ecbatana) region Their emergence in Iran is thought to have occurred between 1000 BC to around 900 BC. - The British Museum is dedicated to human history, art and culture, and is located in the Bloomsbury area of London.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the right answer to the question, \\"Contact between rocks over long periods of time causes rocks to be what?\\" is not \\"loose.\\" Instead, it appears that rocks become \\"slippery\\" when they experience prolonged contact with each other. This slipperiness occurs due to the process of mechanical and chemical weathering. Mechanical weathering involves the breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces through physical processes, such as abrasion (the rubbing or wearing away of one rock against another). Chemical weathering involves the alteration or dissolution of minerals in rocks due to chemical reactions with water, air, or other substances present in the atmosphere or soil. Over time, these weathering processes can cause the rock surfaces to become smoother and more slippery. Additionally, certain rocks can become slick when in contact with water. The water can act as a lubricant between the rock surfaces, reducing friction and causing the rocks to become slippery. This can be particularly noticeable in cases where algae or other microorganisms grow on the wet rock surfaces, further increasing their slipperiness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Spice Girls are an English pop girl group formed in 1994. The group originally consisted of Melanie Brown (\\"Scary Spice\\"), Melanie Chisholm (\\"Sporty Spice\\"), Emma Bunton (\\"Baby Spice\\"), Geri Halliwell (\\"Ginger Spice\\"), and Victoria Beckham, nee Adams (\\"Posh Spice\\"). They were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \\"Wannabe\\" in 1996, which hit number one in 37 countries and established them as a global phenomenon. Their debut album Spice sold more than 31 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. While on tour in the United-States, the group continued to record new material and released a new song, \\"Goodbye\\", before Christmas in 1998. The song was seen as a tribute to Geri Halliwell, and when it topped the UK Singles Chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number-one - equalling the record previously set by the Beatles. Later in 1998, Bunton and Chisholm appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other band members, and the group won two awards: \\"Best Pop Act\\" and \\"Best Group\\" for a second time. In late 1998, Brown and Adams announced they were both pregnant; Brown was married to dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period. She gave birth to daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999. One month later, Adams gave birth to son Brooklyn, whose father was then Manchester United footballer David Beckham. Later that year, she married Beckham in a highly publicised wedding in Ireland. The Spice Girls returned to the studio in August 1999, after an eight-month recording break to start work on their third and last studio album. The album's sound was initially more pop-influenced, similar to their first two albums, and included production from Eliot Kennedy. The album's sound took a mature direction when American producers like Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis came on to collaborate with the group. In December 1999 they performed live for a UK-only tour, Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, also showcasing new songs from the third album. During 1999, the group recorded the character Amneris' song \\"My Strongest Suit\\" in Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida, a concept album which would later go on to fuel the musical version of Verdi's Aida. The band performed again at the 2000 Brit Awards, where they received a Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite being at the event, Halliwell did not join her former bandmates on stage. In November 2000, the group released Forever. Sporting a new edgier R&B sound, the album received a lukewarm response from critics. In the US, the album peaked at number thirty-nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart. In the UK, the album was released the same week as Westlife's Coast to Coast album and the chart battle was widely reported by the media, where Westlife won the battle reaching number one in the UK, leaving the Spice Girls at number two. The lead single from Forever, the double A-side \\"Holler\\"/\\"Let Love Lead the Way\\", became the group's ninth number one single in the UK. However the song failed to break onto the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart stateside, instead peaking at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. \\"Holler\\" did peak at number thirty-one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2000. The only major performance of the lead single came at the MTV Europe Music Awards on 16 November 2000. In total, Forever achieved only a fraction of the success of its two best-selling predecessors, selling five million copies. In December 2000, the group unofficially announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future, although they pointed out that the group was not splitting.

These vast bodies of water influence weather patterns, coastal ecosystems, and global trade, making them an indispensable aspect of life on Earth. In addition, oceans also serve as carbon sinks, absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps to mitigate some of the impacts of human-induced climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

USA TODAY Sports Louisville is removing Papa John's from the name of its football stadium. (Photo: Jonathan Palmer, AP) After an incident last week in which Papa John's founder John Schnatter admitted to using an offensive racial slur during a conference call in May, multiple professional franchises and collegiate athletic programs have suspended or ended their sponsorship contracts with Papa John's. The Utah Jazz is the latest. The NBA team is dropping the brand, first reported by The Salt Lake Tribune on Thursday. The University of Utah is evaluating its deal with Papa John's and is removing any photos of Schnatter and replacing pizza boxes with his likeness on them, per the Tribune. Since the controversy blew up on social media, Schnatter has stepped down as chairman of the pizza franchise. In addition to using the racial slur, Schnatter also was criticized for using graphic imagery to describe the lynchings of African Americans in his hometown in Indiana. One of the first athletic programs to rid itself of the company's name was the University of Louisville, which announced July 13 that it would remove Papa John's from the name of the school's football stadium and call it \\"Cardinal Stadium.\\" As of Thursday, 21 athletic organizations have cut ties with Papa John's. MLB MLB suspended its \\"Papa Slam\\" promotion. The New York Yankees, Baltimore Orioles, Miami Marlins, Washington Nationals, Minnesota Twins, Seattle Mariners, Atlanta Braves and Tampa Bay Rays all suspended their relationship with the company. The Kansas City Royals suspended their promotions. The Texas Rangers canceled their promotions indefinitely. NFL​​​​​​ The Seattle Seahawks ended their partnership with the company. AMB Sports and Entertainment (Atlanta Falcons, Atlanta United, Mercedes-Benz Stadium) suspended its relationship. NBA The Orlando Magic suspended their partnership. The Utah Jazz ended its relationship. MLS In addition to Atlanta United, FC Dallas suspended its promotion. College athletics In addition to Louisville, the University of Kentucky discontinued its financial relationship with Schnatter. And Oregon State suspended its sponsor relationship. ||||| LISTEN TO ARTICLE 3:00 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email Papa John’s International Inc.’s founder John Schnatter regrets resigning as chairman after using a racial slur during a training session and believes the company’s board mishandled the situation by pushing him aside without an investigation, according to people familiar with his thinking. The people, who asked not to be identified discussing private views, didn’t say what action Schnatter might take in response or whether he would ask to be restored to his post. Schnatter declined to comment. The Papa John’s board declined to comment, according to spokesman Peter Collins. Papa John’s shares fell 1 percent on Tuesday to 50.88 at 9:35 a.m. in New York. The stock has lost about a third of its value in the last 12 months. John Schnatter Photographer: Jason Merritt/Getty Images North America Even as Schnatter stewed over his resignation during the weekend, the rest of the six-member Papa John’s board was taking action to further distance the pizza chain from its outspoken founder for his use of a racial slur. On Sunday, a special committee of independent directors ordered the termination of a so-called founder’s agreement that designated Schnatter as the brand’s face and voice. Papa John’s has requested he cease media appearances on behalf of the firm and evicted him from the headquarters, according to a company statement. Schnatter, 56, stepped down as chairman at the request of the board on July 11 after a Forbes report that he used a racial slur and graphic descriptions of violence against minorities in a conversation with the company’s former media agency, Laundry Service. That was just months after he exited the chief executive officer job over critical comments about the National Football League’s national-anthem controversy. The restaurant chain said last week that it plans to appoint a replacement chairman. Schnatter admitted to using the slur but said he was taken out of context. “Regardless of the context, I apologize. Simply stated, racism has no place in our society,” he said, according to a statement emailed last Wednesday. A spokeswoman for Wasserman, the talent-management agency that owns Laundry Service, declined to comment. Papa John’s said Friday that Schnatter will no longer be featured in any of the company’s advertising or marketing materials. The New York Yankees said the same day that it was suspending its relationship with the firm. The University of Louisville announced that the school will change the name of its football stadium from Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium to Cardinal Stadium. Schnatter is still on the company’s board of directors and is its largest shareholder, and the board can’t just remove him, according to people familiar with the matter. Shareholders would have to take that step at the next annual meeting, which is typically held in May. Schnatter, meanwhile, still owns almost 30 percent of the company, which could complicate a potential vote on his ouster. Schnatter’s tied to the company in other ways, too. His wife, Annette Schnatter, is a Papa John’s franchisee with one restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, according to the company’s latest proxy statement. Last year, royalties earned by the company from her restaurant were about 76,000. Schnatter’s airline, Hampton Airways Inc., provides business travel to the company as well. — With assistance by Scott Soshnick ||||| Summary:","completion":"Several professional sports teams and collegiate athletic programs have suspended or terminated their sponsorship contracts with Papa John's.

Question: \\"What was rubia tinctorum sometimes mixed with?\\" Context: \\"The painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments, made from mixing dye with either chalk or alum, kermes lake, made from kermes insects, and madder lake, made from the rubia tinctorum plant. With the arrival of cochineal, they had a third, carmine, which made a very fine crimson, though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully. It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez and Tintoretto. Later it was used by Thomas Gainsborough, Seurat and J.M.W. Turner.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Rubia tinctorum, commonly known as madder, was a crucial source of red pigment during the early Renaissance. This plant-based pigment was widely employed by prominent painters of the time, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez, and Tintoretto. Upon its arrival, cochineal became another essential red coloring agent that was prized by painters for its intense crimson color, although it required careful handling to prevent color alterations. Madder lake, the pigment derived from rubia tinctorum, was often mixed with various substances to create the desired hue, consistency, and luminosity that artists sought for their works. Some of the elements it was combined with include: 1. Chalk or alum: Madder lake was frequently mixed with chalk or alum to produce traditional lake pigments. The addition of these substances enabled the pigments to adhere better to the painting surface, providing a more substantial color. This practice was common not only for madder lake but also for other vegetable or animal-derived pigments, such as kermes lake, obtained from kermes insects. 2. Oil: As most early Renaissance painters utilized oil paints, it was common to mix madder lake with oil to achieve the appropriate consistency and workability for their artistic techniques. The use of oil allowed for better blending of colors and created a smoother, more translucent effect. 3. Other pigments: To obtain the desired shades and hues, painters often combined madder lake with other pigments, such as ochres, umbers, and azurite. Mixing various pigments helped artists create a wide range of colors and achieve the realism and vibrancy they desired in their works. 4. Binders: To ensure the stability and longevity of their paintings, artists mixed madder lake with binders, such as egg yolk, gum arabic, or various resins. These binders helped create a durable and resistant surface, preventing the pigments from flaking or fading over time. 5. Fillers and extenders: Painters also mixed madder lake with fillers and extenders, such as gypsum, calcium carbonate, or barium sulfate. These substances helped bulk up the pigment, making it less transparent and more opaque. Additionally, they helped control the paint's texture and decrease its gloss. In conclusion, rubia tinctorum, or madder lake, was an essential red pigment during the early Renaissance period, used by many renowned painters. To achieve the desired color, consistency, and longevity, it was often mixed with several substances, such as chalk, alum, oil, other pigments, binders, and fillers. The resulting shades and hues allowed these artists to produce striking compositions that became hallmarks of the period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: I'm a mod of a small discord server for fans of an internet music reviewer. All we do is talk music. &amp;#x200B; One day a member joins and immediately starts calling out an inactive member (he used to edit for the music reviewer the server is based on) for being a nazi. He links tweets that are VERY borderline islamophobic. I say borderline because he doesnt encourage violence but still shows a strong despise for islam. He starts defending himself, saying he's not a nazi at all, and that he simply dislikes islam and all religions. &amp;#x200B; At this point I don't know what to do. The newcomer literally just comes here to tell us to ban someone. And he does so aggressively, he just pukes out all of his anger onto him, which doesn't help at all. I get pissed off at both and engage a conversation with the so called nazi, to see if he actually wants to debate. But he's too busy replying to the other, so I get ignored. However the other doesn't ignore me at all, he actually calls us out for supporting nazis, but we didn't know about these tweets and I can safely say that we disagree with every tweet. The chat becomes a mess, I insult the newcomer for hunting people online. I get off the chat to think for a second. &amp;#x200B; I DM the admin and we talk this through. We don't see a reason to ban the member. He's never active, and never talked about anything political, never debated or spread hate, so he didn't break any rules. I tell the admin that I want to ban the newcomer for his aggressive behavior, and because I think he's here for no reason, he would probably leave the server if we didn't ban the other person. The admin tells me to wait, since we agree on the latter part. The admin interrupts the chat and things cool down. The newcomer keeps talking in a passive aggressive way, trying to start the fight again, so I say that i'd ban him if he kept talking about that, even if I'd lose my mod role. This server is only for music, I can't stand people that ruins the chat by bringing politics. The admin yields and tell me to go for it. I ban the dude. The other one stays silent. &amp;#x200B; Later, I see a post about it in the subreddit of the music reviewer.

Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"David Hall\\" correctly answer the question \\"Who operates a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the response \\"David Hall\\" correctly answers the question \\"Who operates a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky?\\" David Hall is the TRLA (Texas Rural Legal Aid) executive director, and in the passage, it is mentioned that his attorneys operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thomas Jefferson Destry, Jr. (Jimmy Stewart) is the deputy sheriff without a gun. He believes the law and public opinion is the answer to outlaws and gunfights. Bottleneck is a lawless town run by bad guys and gunslingers. Kent (Brian Donlevy), a host of gunslingers, the corrupt Judge Slade (Samuel S. Hinds), crooked gamblers and dishonest saloon gal Frenchy (Marlene Dietrich) were cheating, stealing, and forcing farmers to sell them their land against their will in order to have control of all the land when the railroad comes through the territory. The outlaws kill the old sheriff because he is wise to their game. In order to keep law and order out of Bottleneck, Judge Slade appoints the town drunk and apparently incompetent Washington Dimsdale (Charles Winninger) to be the new sheriff. Charles sobers up and is shocked by the news, but steps up to the challenge. Before he was a drunk he had been deputy for Sheriff Tom Destry Sr., who was the roughest, toughest sheriff of all time. Destry Sr. used his fists and his guns to clean up the lawless town, and was Sheriff there until gutless outlaws shot him in the back. Sheriff Dimsdale wires for the younger Destry, the most crack-shot Sheriff of Bottleneck since Destry, Sr. The towns villains hear about Destrys reputation and decide to meet his stagecoach in Bottleneck, and give him a not-quite-warm welcome. When the stage arrives, to everyones surprise, Destry is carrying a birdcage and parasol because he is helping a female passenger - a sweet Bottleneck girl he fancies - debark from the stage. The entire town roars with laughter at the sight of the new deputy who appears to fall short of the lawman ideal. The new sheriff is agreeable and unconcerned about the mocking. Later, he goes to the saloon and attends unarmed: I dont believe in guns, he tells the astounded locals. This prompts more ridiculing from the outlaws.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose friends sneak a copy of the play to Sam Harris? ? In 1929 young Brooklynite Moss Hart, influenced by the great playwrights, devotes his leisure time to writing for the theater. Failing in his aspirations, however, he accepts a job as social director in the Catskills and then stages plays at the YMHA in Newark. Eventually he takes the advice of agent Richard Maxwell and writes a comedy, Once in a Lifetime, which deals with the early days of Hollywood films, despite the fact that his knowledge of the movie industry is derived from the pages of Variety. After being subsidized by a friend, Joe Hyman, he sends the manuscript to producer Warren Stone, who promises a decision within a week. When months pass without any word, Hart's friends sneak a copy of the play to Sam Harris, who agrees to produce it if George Kaufman will collaborate on the script and also direct. Although Kaufman consents, the Atlantic City opening is a failure, and he considers quitting until Hart comes up with an idea that both men feel will turn the play into a hit. It finally opens to rave reviews in New York City in September 1930, thus beginning the long-lasting Kaufman-Hart collaboration.

Tell Kim Jung Un he is doing a good thing.; Given those answer options, answer the question: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made... Question: After the Summit, what will Beasley do? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"[1]. Increase humanitarian aid to North Korea.

This is because the North Korean leadership is hopeful that, following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for the millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. Beasley's visit and interactions with North Korean leadership indicate a willingness to assist in the improvement of the country's economic conditions and relieve the suffering of its people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Things began well for the Raiders as Jalen Richard returned the opening kick 50 yards and Derek Carr hit Andre Holmes for a three-yard touchdown pass to put the Raiders up 7-0. However, the struggling Raiders defense continued to have problems stopping opponents as the Chiefs scored on a two-yard touchdown run by Spencer Ware and a four-yard run by Jamaal Charles (extra point failed), putting the Chiefs in front 13-7. The Raiders were able to get a field goal from Sebastian Janikowski as the half ended to pull within 13-10. However, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, who is 16-2 in his career coming off of bye weeks, continued to baffle the Raiders defense in the second half. The Chiefs added a one-yard run by defensive lineman Dontari Poe and two field goals by Cairo Santos to go up 26-10. The Raiders offense managed nothing in the second half and the Chiefs won 26-10.

If People were always aware of the issue [of gender], but I was never denied an opportunity., can we conclude that \\"Opportunities are never denied due to gender for anyone.\\"? Pick from: 1). yes 2). it is not possible to tell 3). no","completion":"2). It is not possible to tell It is important to remember that personal experiences differ widely, which makes it impossible to draw such a broad, overarching conclusion that \\"opportunities are never denied due to gender for anyone\\" based on one individual's experience. While it's great to hear that the person in question has never faced gender-based discrimination in terms of opportunities, this is not necessarily the case for everyone. Gender discrimination does occur, to varying degrees, in different parts of the world, cultures, and workplaces. In some instances, it may be subtle or even unintentional, while in others, it can be overt and clear. There are multiple factors to consider when evaluating whether opportunities are consistently denied due to gender. Some of these factors include: 1. Geographical location: The country or region someone lives in can play a significant role in whether or not they experience gender-based discrimination. In certain regions, social norms and cultural expectations may impose strict limitations on the opportunities available to particular genders. 2. Industry: Discrimination may be more prevalent in some industries than in others. For example, historically male-dominated sectors such as engineering or construction might have more instances of gender discrimination, while other sectors may exhibit greater equality. 3. Workplace culture: A specific workplace's culture can play a significant role in how opportunities are offered (or not offered) based on gender. Some organizations may have a more inclusive and progressive culture where gender discrimination is minimized, while others may perpetuate traditional gender norms and expectations. 4. Intersectionality: It is important to consider other factors such as race, class, and sexual orientation when analyzing inequalities in opportunities. These factors can intersect with gender in such a way that they compound the discrimination one faces. For example, a woman of color may be subject to both sexism and racism, which may further limit opportunities available to her. 5. Legal protection: While many countries have anti-discrimination laws in place, the effectiveness of these laws, as well as the cultural enforcement of such regulations, may vary. This can influence the degree to which gender discrimination occurs. In conclusion, while the statement \\"I was never denied an opportunity\\" indicates that opportunities are not denied due to gender in some individual cases, it is not possible to generalize this experience to everyone. Gender discrimination is a complex and multifaceted issue that depends on a variety of factors. Therefore, claiming opportunities are \\"never denied due to gender for anyone\\" would be an inaccurate and misleading conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When they go to investigate, they are attacked and eaten by a bizarre lifeform that emerges from the crashed rock, mostly unseen but apparently consisting of multiple heads with hundreds of teeth.Nearby the crash site is a large house located on a rural plot of land. The house is the home of Sam (James L. Brewster) and Barb (Elissa Neil), and their two school-age children, high school age Pete (Tom DeFranco) and his younger brother Charles (Charles George Hildebrandt). Visiting are Aunt Millie (Ethel Michelson) and Uncle Herb (John Schmerling).Sam and Barb rise before anybody else is awake; they have an unspecified trip planned, which Barb hopes can be put off because of the incessant rainstorm. Sam insists, and he goes downstairs to check the basement for flooding. A flapping basement window suggests that the creature from the meteor has taken refuge in the cellar, and sure enough, when Sam goes into the basement, he is eaten by the bizarre monstrosity. Barb suffers the same fate when she goes down to see what happened to Sam; the creature corners her and viciously bites off her face.Aunt Millie is awakened by screaming, but she attributes it to the horror movie that Charles is watching on TV in his room. Charles is obsessed with magic, monsters, and scaring people.

It's important to note that the structure of sentences in Turkish can be quite different from English. In this translation, \\"Bir iyi gazeteci\\" means \\"A good journalist.\\" The verb \\"olmalıdır\\" is a combined form of \\"olmalı\\" which signifies 'should be' and the suffix \\"-dır\\" which is mostly used as a confirmative or explanatory mood in Turkish. \\"Her zaman\\" expresses the time frame indicated by \\"at all times\\". Finally, \\"tamamen objektif\\" captures the sense of \\"totally objective.\\" As such, Turkish language sentences often follow a different order than English sentences, usually a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) format, as opposed to the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure commonly used in English. However, in this case, the sentence structure remains the same in both languages. It's interesting to note how languages can maintain the same meaning while changing the structure and order of phrases and sentences. This is an example of why translation often requires more than simply changing words from one language to another; it often involves restructuring sentences and making sure the correct meaning is preserved.

Saying the current set-up was \\"confusing\\" and the move would save money, Sir Bernard added: \\"We should get improved operational effectiveness and that's what this report is talking about: how to respond to a terrorist incident - would we respond better together? And I think we would.\\" But the City of London Police said the paper itself had noted that merging forces would cause \\"significant disruption\\". In his review Lord Harris, a security adviser who chaired the Metropolitan Police Authority, concluded that any response to a terror attack would now be \\"substantially faster and more effective\\" than five years ago. But, he said, even though the intelligence agencies and the counter-terrorist police operating in London were among the best in the world, the city should be prepared for an attack with multiple fatalities. The review also found that, once the Met had completed its recruitment of 600 extra firearms officers, there would be no need for a further increase. To do so \\"would be at the cost of transforming the look and feel of our capital city\\", it said. A total of 127 recommendations were made in the paper. Lord Harris also said live CCTV streaming should be extended across London. Earlier this year Mr Khan intervened after Westminster Council announced it would turn off its fixed CCTV cameras to save money. City of London Police said it welcomed the review but warned against merging it with the Met. \\"As the report clearly states, policing in London needs stability and certainty, not upheaval and disruption,\\" they said. The BTP's Paul Crowther welcomed the report but said: \\"Over the past eight years, there have been a number of studies that have examined the rationale and effectiveness of a dedicated transport police force. \\"Each study has unequivocally concluded that there is a need for a specialist national force, which can provide 'end to end' policing and an understanding of this complex environment.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Lord Harris of Haringey has proposed merging the Met Police, the City of London Police, and the British Transport Police (BTP) in a review ordered by London mayor Sadiq Khan to assess the city's security.

Premise: The move was smooth, relaxed, and very impressive. Hypothesis: The move was awkward and ill planned. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. In fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. Let's analyze both statements in detail to understand the differences between them. Premise: The move was smooth, relaxed, and very impressive. In this statement, the premise is putting forth the idea that the move (which could refer to a physical maneuver, a transition from one location to another, or even a strategic decision) was executed seamlessly. The use of the words \\"smooth,\\" \\"relaxed,\\" and \\"very impressive\\" indicates that the move was well-thought-out, organized, efficient, and successful in its execution. From this statement, we would surmise that the people or entities involved in the move were pleased with the outcome and could rightfully feel a sense of accomplishment. Hypothesis: The move was awkward and ill-planned. This hypothesis presents an entirely different view of the move. Rather than the positive adjectives used in the premise, the hypothesis uses negative descriptors such as \\"awkward\\" and \\"ill-planned.\\" These descriptors suggest a sense of disorganization, discomfort, and challenges experienced during the move. This could mean that the decision-making was disjointed and caused undesirable consequences or unexpected issues. In this case, based on the hypothesis, we can infer dissatisfaction with the move and a potentially difficult or problematic outcome. Upon analyzing both the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, ATP molecules would be produced in sample A. The paragraph gives a hint about the correlation between the respiration rate, energy use, and the ATP production, which reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. This process takes place during cellular respiration, which is the process by which cells consume oxygen in order to produce usable energy. This energy is converted from glucose in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. In the given scenario, Bob, the biologist, induced a higher respiration rate in sample A and induced no respiration rate in sample B. Since the respiration rate is a key component for ATP production, it would logically follow that the process of ATP production would occur in the sample where respiration is occurring i.e. sample A. This is because a higher respiration rate would mean that more oxygen is being consumed, leading to more glucose being broken down - thereby producing more ATP molecules. Conversely, Sample B which has no respiration occurring would not produce ATP as there is no use of oxygen to break down the glucose into ATP. Moreover, the paragraph indicates that ATP production correlates with energy usage which tends to be higher in organisms that have higher respiration rates. This further supports the deduction that Sample A - not Sample B - would be the organism where ATP molecules would be produced. The paragraph does not provide enough information regarding samples C and D's relationship with ATP production directly. However, it implies that both heterotrophic organisms (like sample C) and autotrophic organisms (like sample D) can produce ATP - the former acquires glucose from other organisms, and the latter makes their own glucose primarily through photosynthesis. However, in context of the given information, ATP production is specifically linked to the process of respiration - such high levels of which are observed in Sample A only."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They can tell me a lot. One student told me how he relaxed before exams. Another student told me about great websites about learning History and English. The Buddy Club is also a good place to just forget about school altogether! One of the older students taught us origami . We made paper planes, birds and hats together. The table tennis tournament was a great idea. I didn't do very well, but I learnt a lot from watching the doubles tournament won by a fourteen-year-old girl and a seventeen-year-old boy. Last year, we had the annual Buddy Club Picnic. Everyone enjoyed the games we played. After I learnt how to fish, I caught two fish in the lake. I think it might be a good idea to change the Buddy Club Picnic to a weekend camping trip. We could learn how to put up tents and how to find our way through a forest. Many of the older students know how to do this already, and I think they would like to teach the younger students. I want to say again how much I enjoy the club. When I'm older, I will make friends with younger students. Then, I can tell them all about school life and growing up.

Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who did Oskar confide in? Movie title: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Movie plot: Nine-year-old Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), who suffers from Asperger syndrome, is the son of German American Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks).[5] Thomas would often send Oskar on missions to do something involving one of his riddles. The last riddle he ever gives Oskar is proof that New York City once possessed a Sixth Borough. In a flashback, Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt to find objects throughout New York City. The game requires communication with other people and is not easy for the socially awkward Oskar who is told \\"If things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding\\". On September 11, 2001, Oskar and his classmates are sent home from school early while his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) is at work. When Oskar gets home, he finds five messages from his father on the answering machine saying he is in the World Trade Center. When Thomas calls for the sixth time, although Oskar is present to answer this call, he is too scared to answer. The machine records a sixth message which stops when the building collapses. Oskar knows his father has been killed and falls to the floor. He replaces the answering machine with a new one and hides the old one so his mother will never find out. A few weeks after what Oskar calls \\"the worst day,\\" he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer. Oskar's relationship with his mother worsens since she cannot explain why the World Trade Center was attacked and why his father died. Oskar tells his mother he wishes it had been her in the building, not his father, and she responds, \\"So do I\\". After, Oskar says he did not mean it, but his mother doesn't believe him. A year later, Oskar finds a vase in his father's closet with a key in an envelope with the word \\"Black\\" on it. He vows to find what the key fits. He finds 472 Blacks in the New York phone book and plans to meet each of them to see if they knew his father. He first meets Abby Black (Viola Davis), who has recently divorced her husband. She tells Oskar she did not know his father. One day, Oskar... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\", the primary character young Oskar Schell, who is dealing with the profound loss of his father Thomas Schell in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, confides in his German grandmother in the wake of this tragedy. Oskar carries an immense weight of personal guilt and grief after choosing not to answer his father's final phone call from the World Trade Center and subsequently replacing the answering machine which recorded the final messages so his mother Linda, who was at work during the event, could not hear them. At this turning point in his life, Oskar turns to his grandmother for emotional support and solace. Their bond strengthens further as they navigate their way through shared sorrow and loss. Simultaneously, Oskar's relationship with his mother grows strained as he grapples with her inability or unwillingness to explain the reasons for the attack and his father's death. At one point in his emotional despair, he even tells his mother that he would have preferred it if she had been the one in the building instead of his father, an outburst that greatly affects their relationship, despite Oskar subsequently retracting his words. Later in his bereavement journey, Oskar finds a key in his father's closet, which acts as a kind of legacy or posthumous riddle from his father, a man who had a penchant for sending him on riddle-solving missions and scavenger hunts. Enclosed in an envelope marked \\"Black\\", this key sets Oskar off on a mission to find its corresponding lock. As part of this mission, he plans to meet all 472 people named Black that he can find in the New York phone book, hoping that this journey will reveal the purpose and significance of his father's key, and perhaps, help him process his own feelings of loss and displacement. His first visit is with Abby Black, who unfortunately, could not provide Oskar with the information he was looking for. In summary, Oskar confides and seeks solace in his grandmother during his time of profound grief, and embarks on an emotionally-charged mission sparked by a key left by his late father. Even if you as an investor are not aware of specific finer details of the plot, the movie showcases an emotional journey of a young child through a pivotal moment in history, offering a unique perspective on grief, growth, and coming-of-age, all of these presenting potentially valuable facets that may make the movie worthwhile to invest in."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. On the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match wouldn't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this isn't about football it is about discrimination and the women's enthusiasm for the sport they love. The film opens on the day of a crucial World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain, a girl is trying to get in to Tehran's Azadi Stadium by dressing like a boy, it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her. Once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught, here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who's leader would rather be back home tending his livestock. We never learn the character's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary. As well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day Iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the \\"disguise\\" one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer. The girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that Iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in Germany. The soldiers aren't shown as fundamentalists, they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman can't watch men's sports don't seem that convinced by their own arguments. It is a shame that this film can't be seen in Iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary Iranians aren't a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere.

Context: It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: United States LANGUAGE English language; A Wizard of Mars COUNTRY United States","completion":"The data provided outlines that the book \\"A Wizard of Mars\\" is written in English and was published in the United States. Interestingly, the shared language between the nation of publication and the language the book is written in is a significant factor. This suggests that the book was likely intended for an audience within the United States or people who are proficient in English. Firstly, reflecting on the piece of data that the language is English. English is a widely used language not only in the United States but across the world. Therefore, English language books have a vast potential readership. However, noting that the book's country is the United States, it could hint that the author is from the U.S., or the book was first published there, impacting the context or culture represented in the novel. The title \\"A Wizard of Mars\\" suggests a fantasy or science fiction genre, offering a glimpse into the kind of storyline the book might present. If the book was indeed published in the United States, it would likely reflect the aspects of American culture, idioms, references, and even the thought process that the author wants to portray to the readers. This specificity could have important implications for understanding the text, especially for international readers. Moreover, the U.S. is home to one of the biggest global publishing industries. This means that a book published in the United States is more likely to reach a broad audience and have a significant cultural impact. Additionally, English language books from the U.S. often get translated into many different languages, which could further extend the book's reach and influence. However, there's only minimal data given about the book, so it would be helpful to have additional information for more accurate analysis. For instance, knowing the author's biography can provide more context about the perspective and experiences the book might reflect. Knowing when the book was published would also give insight into the historical and cultural context of that time period, which could greatly aid in the book's interpretation. The book \\"A Wizard of Mars\\", written in the English language and published in the United States, therefore, represents a piece of the diverse mosaic of the American and global literature scene. It facilitates cultural exchange through the universal English language and gives readers around the world a glimpse into the imaginations and creative expressions rooted in its country of origin. However, to fully appreciate and understand any piece of literature, a larger context, including the author's backgrounds, the era of its publication, and the society it was published in, is crucially important. Despite the lack of such information in the given data, the knowledge that it's a U.S. published English book already gives a substantial starting point for any literary exploration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights.

Comparisons have been made to the classic Italian film Bicycle Thieves, suggesting that Wendy and Lucy may be a modern take on that story's themes of loss and perseverance in the face of economic hardship. Similarly, some critics have referred to Wendy and Lucy as a prime example of \\"New Recession Cinema,\\" highlighting its relevance to contemporary socio-economic issues. Despite being minimalistic and occasionally slow-paced, Wendy and Lucy has garnered appreciation for its ability to deliver a powerful and deeply affecting dramatic experience in just 80 minutes. The careful execution of each scene and the strong performances from the cast, particularly Michelle Williams, contribute to the lasting impact the film has on its viewers. Overall, the consensus points to Kelly Reichardt's Wendy and Lucy as a touching, thought-provoking film that packs a significant emotional wallop despite its small size."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The authoritarian leader has been in office for more than 20 years in the impoverished former Soviet republic. The EU and the US have not recognised a single election in the Central Asian country as free and fair. Polls across the mountainous country were due to open at 01:00 GMT and close at 15:00 GMT. By Abdujalil AbdurasulovBBC News, Almaty Central Asia is widely known for its obscure \\"Stans\\" - to be found at the bottom of most democracy rankings. Tajikistan is not the worst in the region but presidential elections there are hardly any different from its neighbours. For Emomali Rakhmon, these will be his fourth elections and there is little doubt he will win again. He is competing against virtually unknown politicians and the only credible opposition candidate has criticised what she called artificial obstacles and intimidation, which prevented her from running for the presidency. However, analysts say the elections may bring some change, although not necessarily in the government or its policies. People's perceptions and attitudes towards the government could change if mass irregularities take place on voting day. The international community will also be watching the elections closely. As part of the withdrawal campaign, Nato and the US will ship some of their equipment out of Afghanistan through Central Asia, including Tajikistan. Preliminary results are expected on Thursday. Tajikistan's official electoral commission has already declared the presidential election as valid. The head of the electoral commission, Shermuhammad Shohiyon, told Tajik state television that 68% of registered voters had already cast their ballots by 14:00 local time (09:00 GMT) - easily surpassing the minimum 50% participation required to validate the vote. Mr Rakhmon, who secured 79% of the vote in the 2006 election, did not campaign actively this time. Instead, the president relied on extensive media coverage of his visits around the country, which his opponents say was heavily biased in his favour. Election monitors complained when their bus turned up bearing a poster of the president on the windscreen. The bus company removed the poster. The opposition accuses Mr Rakhmon - whose huge billboards are seen everywhere in the capital Dushanbe and other towns - of developing a personality cult. He denies the claim. The five other presidential candidates have refrained from publicly criticising Mr Rakhmon. Human rights activists Oynihol Bobonazarova - widely seen as the only genuine opposition candidate - was banned from the polls. The electoral commission said earlier she had failed to collect the necessary 210,000 signatures of eligible voters to be officially registered. Despite the expected easy victory, critics say Mr Rakhmon will face rising social tension in the country where some 50% of the population live in poverty. Almost half of the nation's GDP is earned by more than one million Tajik migrants working abroad, especially in Russia, Analysts say Tajikistan could also face further security challenges from Islamist groups in neighbouring Afghanistan after the planned pullout of the US-led forces next year. Tajikistan was devastated by the 1992-97 civil war between the Moscow-backed government and the Islamist-led opposition. Up to 50,000 were killed before the conflict ended with a UN-brokered peace agreement. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"This article discusses the presidential elections in Tajikistan, with incumbent leader Emomali Rakhmon expected to win his fourth term in office. Rakhmon faces five challengers, but the only genuine opposition candidate, Oynihol Bobonazarova, was barred from standing, reportedly due to not collecting the required number of signatures. The EU and the US have not recognized a single election in Tajikistan as free and fair. Although not much change is expected in government or policies, analysts suggest that people's perceptions and attitudes towards the government could change if mass irregularities occur during the elections.

Authorities might find out Tuesday whether a body was buried under a shed in Roseville, Michigan. They just won't know whether it's missing Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa or not. Two soil samples were taken from a home in the suburban Detroit community of Roseville last week after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried on the property a day after Hoffa disappeared in 1975. The samples were taken from beneath a storage shed and sent to a lab at Michigan State University for tests to determine the presence of human remains. The hope had been to get the findings back sometime Monday. But in a press release issued Monday afternoon, Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said he'd been told that, while testing had begun, \\"the results of those tests will not be available until early (Tuesday) morning.\\" What police do know is that the samples that were unearthed didn't contain any \\"discernible remains,\\" such as bones, body parts or other evidence, according to Berlin. The search of the Roseville property is the latest in an on-again, off-again search for Hoffa, whose disappearance 35 years ago captured the public imagination. Hoffa, then 62, was last seen on July 30, 1975, outside the Detroit-area Machus Red Fox restaurant. He was there ostensibly to meet with reputed Detroit Mafia street enforcer Anthony Giacalone and Genovese crime family figure Anthony Provenzano, who was also a chief of a Teamsters local in New Jersey. Giacalone died in 1982; Provenzano died in 1988 in prison. The tipster, a former gambler, once did business with a man tied to Giacalone, said Dan Moldea, author of \\"The Hoffa Wars.\\" Moldea said he first spoke to the tipster in March and then sent him to police. Vanished Hoffa still fascinates after almost 40 years. Despite those links, Moldea said it seems unlikely that anyone would have been buried at the site, in full view of the neighborhood. And if a body had been buried there, little would remain, he said. The lab tests being conducted on the soil samples will be able to determine if human remains were buried at the site, but will not identify them, Berlin said. If human remains are discovered, investigators would have to return for a more complete excavation, he said. Even so, Berlin doubts any possible human remains discovered at the house would be those of Hoffa. \\"It would be great if it was, because I would like to bring closure to his family and the tens of thousands of Teamsters that idolize this man, and just the southeast of Michigan,\\" Berlin said. \\"This is kind of like an open wound that won't go away. Every couple of years this happens, and all you guys come out here and we have to relive it.\\" But Berlin said the \\"time line doesn't really add up.\\" Hoffa was of the most powerful union leaders at a time when unions wielded enormous political sway. He was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud. President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971 on condition he not attempt to get back into the union movement before 1980. Hoffa believed Giacalone had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between Hoffa and Provenzano, but Hoffa was the only one who showed up for the meeting, according to the FBI. Giacalone and Provenzano later told the FBI that no meeting had been scheduled. The FBI said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to Hoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters and the mob's influence over the union's pension funds. Police and the FBI have searched for Hoffa intermittently. In September 2001, the FBI found DNA that linked Hoffa to a car that agents suspected was used in his disappearance. In 2004, authorities removed floorboards from a Detroit home to look for traces of blood, as former Teamsters official Frank Sheeran claimed in a biography that he had shot Hoffa. Sheeran died in 2003. Two years later, the FBI razed a horse barn in Michigan following what it called \\"a fairly credible lead.\\" Urban lore long suggested that Hoffa was buried around the end zone at the former Giants Stadium in New Jersey. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Authorities are conducting tests on soil samples taken from beneath a storage shed in Roseville, Michigan, following a tip that a body was buried there a day after Jimmy Hoffa, a missing Teamster boss, disappeared in 1975.

I have a new situation: Two countries situated at different latitudes are exposed to climate change. Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator. But I can use this background: During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1] What is an answer for this question: Which country will feel the effects of climate change more quickly? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Iceland will feel the effects of climate change more quickly. The given background information states that the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world, as above average temperatures are predicted for places like Northwest Canada and Alaska. Since Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, it is situated at a higher latitude than Ecuador, which is near the Equator. Moreover, anthropological research on the native Inuit peoples of Alaska highlights the importance of studying the effects of climate change on communities that have adapted to ecological and climate variability. This further reinforces the notion that areas closer to the poles, like Iceland, are more susceptible to the immediate impacts of climate change when compared to countries near the Equator, such as Ecuador. Taking all these factors into consideration, it can be concluded that Iceland will likely experience the effects of climate change more quickly than Ecuador."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gaddafi summarized Third International Theory in three short volumes published between 1975 and 1979, collectively known as The Green Book. Volume one was devoted to the issue of democracy, outlining the flaws of representative systems in favour of direct, participatory GPCs. The second dealt with Gaddafi's beliefs regarding socialism, while the third explored social issues regarding the family and the tribe. While the first two volumes advocated radical reform, the third adopted a socially conservative stance, proclaiming that while men and women were equal, they were biologically designed for different roles in life. During the years that followed, Gaddafists adopted quotes from The Green Book, such as \\"Representation is Fraud\\", as slogans. Meanwhile, in September 1975, Gaddafi implemented further measures to increase popular mobilization, introducing objectives to improve the relationship between the Councils and the ASU.

Answer: A:","completion":"The tone of this product review is predominantly negative. Multiple aspects of the review point towards this negative perception of the work being reviewed, which is the latest Grimes effort. The reviewer expresses disappointment, dissatisfaction, and disapproval in various ways throughout their review. To begin with, the title, \\"Bury This One Deep,\\" suggests that the reviewer would rather see the work hidden and forgotten rather than celebrated or recommended to others. This expression implies a strong sense of distaste and disapproval towards the book. The statement \\"This latest Grimes effort has hit the bottom,\\" further emphasizes this negative tone. It implies that the reviewer believes this particular work is the lowest point in Grimes' career and has reached a level of quality well below any previous books she has authored. The use of the phrase \\"hit the bottom\\" is a common way to express that something has reached its lowest point and is considered terrible. As the reviewer continues, they provide specific criticisms about the content and writing style of the book, including the shift from \\"great descriptive British cozies\\" to \\"overbearing psychological portrayals of even the most minor characters.\\" Mentioning a preference for Grimes' earlier work reflects a strong sense of disappointment and frustration in the perceived decline of her work's quality. A direct comparison to another author, Ruth Rendell, is made as well with a negative implication. The phrase \\"Ruth Rendell She's not\\" suggests that the reviewer believes that Grimes is attempting to mimic Rendell's style, but has failed to execute it properly. This observation further highlights the growing dissatisfaction with Grimes' current writing. Towards the end of the review, the reviewer expresses a strong desire for Grimes to \\"put DCI Jury in his GRAVE and spare him any more embarrassment,\\" which is yet another sign of their disapproval. They are essentially requesting the author to put an end to the series and character, believing that continuing would only cause further degradation of Grimes' reputation. In conclusion, the overall tone of this product review is decisively negative. The reviewer communicates their displeasure in several ways, such as the title, unfavorable comparisons to earlier work, and specific criticisms relating to the book's content and style. Furthermore, they suggest that the author should cease working with the main character, implying a belief that the work should be buried and forgotten."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth.

When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons.

Theodore John Kaczynski (; born May 22, 1942), also known as the Unabomber, is an American domestic terrorist. A mathematics prodigy, he abandoned an academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle, then between 1978 and 1995 he killed three people, and injured 23 others, in a nationwide bombing campaign targeting those involved with modern technology. In conjunction, he issued a social critique opposing industrialization and advancing a nature-centered form of anarchism. At Harvard, Kaczynski lived during his first year at 8 Prescott Street, which was designed to accommodate the youngest, most precocious freshmen in a small, intimate living space. The next three years he lived at Eliot House. One of his suitemates there recalled that he avoided contact with others and \\"would just rush through the suite, go into his room, and slam the door.\\" Another suitemate said Kaczynski was reserved, but regarded him as a genius: \\"It's just an opinion - but Ted was brilliant.\\" Other students stated Kaczynski was less socially averse than these descriptions imply; an Eliot House resident who dined with Kaczynski at times called him \\"very quiet, but personable ... He would enter into the discussions maybe a little less so than most [but] he was certainly friendly.\\" As a sophomore, Kaczynski participated in a study described by author Alton Chase as a \\"purposely brutalizing psychological experiment\\", led by Harvard psychologist Henry Murray. Subjects were told they would be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student, and were asked to write essays detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations. The essays were turned over to an anonymous attorney, who in a later session would confront and belittle the subject - making \\"vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive\\" attacks - using the content of the essays as ammunition, while electrodes monitored the subject's physiological reactions. These encounters were filmed, and subjects' expressions of rage were later played back to them repeatedly. The experiment ultimately lasted three years, with someone verbally abusing and humiliating Kaczynski each week. In total, Kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of the study. Kaczynski's lawyers later attributed his hostility towards mind control techniques to this experience. Some sources have suggested that Murray's experiments were part of the US government's research into mind control, known as Project MKUltra. Chase and others have also suggested that this experience may have motivated Kaczynski's criminal activities, while philosopher Jonathan D. Moreno has said that, while \\"Kaczynski's anti-technological fixation and his critique itself had some roots in the Harvard curriculum,\\" Kaczynski's later bombing campaign can \\"by no means be laid at Harvard's door\\". Kaczynski earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Harvard in 1962. He finished with an above-average 3.12 GPA but had been expected to perform better. what else happened during the experiment?","completion":"Ted Kaczynski was involved in a psychological experiment during his time at Harvard. The study, led by psychologist Henry Murray, was quite intense and challenging for those involved, including Kaczynski. They were asked to write essays about their personal beliefs and then faced an anonymous attorney who would aggressively attack and belittle them using the content of their essays. During the experiment, the participants had their reactions to these confrontations monitored, with their angry expressions being recorded. Later, these videos were played back to them repeatedly, which might have been a way to further provoke their emotional reactions. Some people think that this harsh and difficult experience may have influenced Kaczynski's later actions as the Unabomber. However, it is important to remember that many things can happen in a person's life, and not everything can be directly connected to one specific event or experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(A). shampoo was from a well known brand.; (B). soap was from a well known brand.;","completion":"The shampoo worked a lot better than the soap because the shampoo was from a well-known brand. This implies that the shampoo's formulation was specifically designed to address the needs and demands of the target audience, resulting in higher performance and effectiveness as compared to the soap. As a product from a reputable brand, the shampoo likely underwent rigorous research and development processes, focusing on aspects such as cleansing, nourishing, and conditioning the hair, among others. It might have been enriched with natural and premium-quality ingredients, like plant extracts and essential oils, especially formulated to cater to diverse hair types and textures. Furthermore, it would have been tested and perfected in state-of-the-art laboratories, ensuring the right balance and compatibility of its components for optimal results. Conversely, while the soap may also have been from a well-known brand, it was not specifically tailored for hair care. Soaps are generally created for cleaning the body and possess a more alkaline pH, which may negatively impact the hair's cuticles and potentially strip away the hair's essential oils, leading to dryness, brittleness, or even damage. Shampoos, on the other hand, are made with a milder formulation that preserves the hair's natural moisture, preventing damage and promoting overall hair health. Moreover, the shampoo's brand reputation not only implies high-quality ingredients but also signifies that consumers place their trust in its product offerings. This particular brand likely has a long-standing history of delivering effective and reliable hair care solutions, which is evident in its customers' loyalty and satisfaction with the results. In conclusion, the shampoo worked a lot better than the soap mainly because it was developed by a well-known brand with expertise in hair care. This expertise is a testament to the brand's ability to innovate and create products that target specific haircare needs and concerns, ensuring that the shampoo provides superior performance compared to the soap, which is designed for general body cleansing rather than hair care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What causes the development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls?, Context: Puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones, tissue responsiveness or obesity.","completion":"The development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls is caused by the surge in hormone production during puberty.

Question: What do the boundaries between reality and fiction become in this movie? Title: The Stunt Man Movie plot: Cameron (Steve Railsback) is a young veteran running from the police. He stumbles onto the set of a World War I movie and isn't sure if he has accidentally caused the death of one of the film's stunt men. The eccentric and autocratic director, Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), agrees to hide Cameron from the police if he will take the dead man's place. Cameron soon begins to suspect that Cross is putting him in excessive danger. At a bar one night, another member of the production gets drunk and tells Cameron that Eli almost killed the helicopter pilot during the fatal accident Cameron caused, because he insisted he keep flying in order to get the shot. Cameron falls in love with Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the film's star, and is devastated to find out that she and Eli slept together before he met her. The boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred as Cross exercises godlike control over the production. During a screening of some footage for Nina's parents who are visiting the production, a nude sex scene with Nina is shown. Eli appears to be mortified, but allows the footage to play anyway. He waits until Nina is just about to shoot a traumatic scene the next day to tell her that her parents have seen the footage of her naked. It causes her to cry with humiliation, which seems to be the exact emotion Eli needs from her in the scene. The final day of filming involves a complicated stunt where Cameron has to drive a vintage Duesenberg off a bridge. Nina has two other scenes to shoot as well, but Cameron is convinced Eli will rig the stunt so he will die. He persuades Nina to run away with him, but they are unable to leave the set, which is kept sealed from the neighboring town by the police on Eli's orders. Nina hides in the trunk of the Duesenberg, promising to slip away with Cameron during the stunt.

Write an article that answers the following question: Who had the most yards in touchdown passes over the entire game?","completion":"Title: Uncovering the Quarterback with the Most Yards in Touchdown Passes Over a Single Game Introduction: In the world of American football, the quarterback holds a particularly important position as the team's biggest offensive weapon. A talented QB can almost single-handedly carry his team to a thrilling victory by throwing long, accurate pass plays. But, have you ever wondered which quarterback holds the impressive record of having the most yards in touchdown passes over a single game? This article will dive into the history books, explore the exploits of iconic QBs, and reveal the record holder for this impressive feat. Breaking Records: The History of American Football: Before delving into the identity of the quarterback who achieved this seemingly insurmountable record, let's first look at how the sport has evolved. American football can trace its roots back to the latter half of the 19th century when it branched off from the games of association football and rugby. Throughout the decades, the sport has continued to develop and grow in popularity, as have the records broken on the field. The National Football League (NFL) began in 1920 and has since become the preeminent professional league for American football. Talented quarterbacks who have left a mark on the field are names like Joe Montana, Johnny Unitas, and Peyton Manning. These legends have shattered statistical benchmarks and won numerous accolades. However, the quarterback we are most interested in the context of this article is neither a Montana nor a Unitas. The Record Holder: Norm Van Brocklin's Historic Game: On September 28, 1951, Norm Van Brocklin, an accomplished quarterback playing for the Los Angeles Rams, forever etched his name in NFL history. In a game against the New York Yanks at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, contemporaneously referred to as \\"the Dutchman,\\" Van Brocklin uncorked an astonishing aerial performance that remains unmatched to this day. Over the course of that single game, Van Brocklin threw for a jaw-dropping 554 passing yards, accumulating five touchdown passes in the process. This stunning display of skill and athleticism earned him the record for the most yards in touchdown passes over a single game. Van Brocklin's performance contributed to the Rams' 54-14 rout of the Yanks. Van Brocklin's Record: Resilience Over the Decades: Despite the game having evolved, featuring bigger and faster athletes, improved technology, and advanced strategy, Van Brocklin's record remains unbeaten. Quarterbacks such as Warren Moon, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees have all come exceptionally close to surpassing the record but have fallen short by a few dozen yards. However, the fact that Van Brocklin's feat has persevered for seven decades is a testament to its rarity and brilliance. What made Van Brocklin's performance even more remarkable was his overall career achievements. As a nine-time Pro Bowl selection and a two-time NFL champion, Norm Van Brocklin's inclusion in the Pro Football Hall of Fame is no surprise. Conclusion: Records in sports offer a snapshot of extraordinary, singular moments of athletic achievement. Even though many NFL records have been rewritten over the years, some stand the test of time, indicative of their brilliance. Norm Van Brocklin's incredibly successful career and his seemingly untouchable 554-yard passing game make him the unyielding answer to the question: Who had the most yards in touchdown passes over the entire game? After all, the flying Dutchman soars high, just like the passes he once threw."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One way to do this is by taking care of your skin, hair, and using makeup. This article will tell you some ways to do that! 1. Work on having flawless skin To have nice, smooth skin, it's important to keep it clean and healthy. Here's how you can do that: - Wash your face every day with water and a gentle soap to get rid of dirt and germs. - Put on sunscreen when you go outside to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays. - Don't touch your face too much, because your hands might have germs on them. - Drink lots of water to stay hydrated and help your skin look its best. 2. Get the makeup Makeup can be fun to play with, but it's important to use it the right way. Using too much can cause skin problems like pimples, and it's not safe to share makeup with other people because it can spread germs. Here are some tips for using makeup: - Use makeup that's made for kids, like products with natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals. - Only use a little bit of makeup, and always wash it off before bedtime. - Make sure to check with a grown-up before trying any makeup products. 3. Use your natural beauty Every person is beautiful in their own way, and it's important to embrace our unique traits. Here's how you can show off your natural beauty: - Smile! A big, happy smile makes everyone look and feel more beautiful. - Take good care of your skin and hair by keeping them clean and healthy. - Wear clothes that make you feel good about yourself and show off your personality. 4. Don't forget your hair! Hair is a big part of how we look and feel. To keep your hair looking great, follow these steps: - Brush or comb your hair every day to keep it tangle-free and neat. - Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner about 2-3 times a week, depending on your hair type. - Try fun hairstyles, like braids or ponytails, to keep your hair looking cute and stylish. 5. Is tanning trendy? Tanning is when you sit in the sun to make your skin darker. Although some people think having a tan makes them look good, the sun can actually be harmful to your skin. Here's why: - The sun gives off ultraviolet (UV) rays that can cause sunburns and even skin cancer later in life. - Tanning can make your skin dry and wrinkly before you're grown up. It's better to protect your skin with sunscreen and stay in the shade instead of trying to get a tan. Remember, it's most important to be comfortable in your own skin and embrace your natural beauty! That's it! By taking care of your skin, hair, and using makeup wisely, you can look and feel your best every day. Always remember that each person's beauty is unique and special in its own way, so be proud of who you are!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Article: A new study suggests that the way to weight loss may be clear.A couple of glasses of water before meals help dieters lose about 5 pounds more than those who do not drink water.While drinking water before a meal may fill a person up,the contents of their meal are important as well.Should a person be eating a low-fat diet or a lowcarbohydrate diet? Or does it matter at all? Recent research suggests that one diet isn't any better than the other.A few weeks before the water study,another concluded that lowfat and lowcarbohydrate diets tied in weight loss.While the lowcarbohydrate dieters did show a slight increase in good cholesterol and a reduction in blood pressure,there was not much difference in the dieters'weight loss.The point here is that the person had to stick to the diet.What helps a person see a diet through? It could be body type. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,as reported byTimemagazine,found that body shape is the key to which diet a person will be able to stick with.Apples are people who carry most of their weight above the belt,while pears carry their weight around their hips .Apple types were more likely to be highinsulin secretors who respond more strongly to carbohydrates in their bodies.They lost the most weight on a lowcarbohydrate diet.Pears were lowinsulin secretors who lost the same amount of weight on both diets.Unstable insulin levels can create stronger hunger senses,causing the apple types to go off their diet plans. All of these studies again come down to choosing the diet that helps you eat less.The bodytype diet does make some sense as men are more likely to be apple types,with larger stomachs,and tend to do well on higherprotein diets,while women,who tend to carry weight around their hips,find themselves drawn to the lowfat diets.The reality is if a diet is failing you try another one.A plan you can't,or won't,stick to will never work,no matter what the research says.

This sentence emphasizes that the museum building maintains a \\"European style\\" of oriental modern architecture.

Article: equal rites Gay Marriage All Goes According to Andrew Cuomo’s Plan It all went according to plan. Oh, the two-week delay on a gay-marriage vote, the exact identities of the final Senate Republican “yes” voters — true, those frustrating twists and uncertainties weren’t pretty, and there were moments when the whole thing could have come crashing down. But to a remarkable degree, the same-sex marriage endgame unfolded just as Governor Andrew Cuomo had drawn it up months ago. And his \\"what-me-worry?\\" posture throughout the end-of-session mess was crucial in making it happen: Cuomo’s confidence game — his repeated public statements and private assurances to marriage advocates and legislative fence-sitters that legalization was inevitable, even when it wasn’t — created the climate for the last breakthrough today. Well, that and some good old-fashioned horse-trading. Cuomo had outlined his big three legislative priorities last year, during his campaign for governor, and after pushing through a state budget in March he kept a tight focus on winning a property tax cap, tightening ethics rules, and passing gay marriage. Getting everything done required providing something for everyone: Upstate and suburban Republicans wanted the tax cap; city Democrats wanted rent regulations; and Cuomo, who believed in gay marriage in principle, also needed it politically to shore up his progressive credentials. Just establishing the goals didn’t get them done, of course; Cuomo and his allies worked relentlessly to maintain the favorable momentum, from Cuomo’s approval-number-boosting roadshow to — pivotally, in the case of gay marriage — organizing a well-financed ground-game, run by his aide Steve Cohen and political consultant Jennifer Cunningham, that teamed with gay advocacy groups like Empire State Pride Agenda and the Human Rights Campaign to flood legislators with pro-marriage calls and mail. This paid off most spectacularly with the switch of Brooklyn Democrat Joe Addabbo from a “no” vote in 2009 to a “yes” this month, a necessary domino to bringing two other Dems and Republicans Jim Alesi and Roy McDonald on board. But once Cuomo had established the fundamental architecture of the bargain, the rest was mere haggling: A shift in rent regulation numbers here, some significant loopholes in ethics rules there, plus a dash of extra legalese in the amendment to gay marriage. The new governor determined his strengths months ago, and pinpointed his colleagues' and opponents' weaknesses, and those things haven’t changed. He knew that Shelly Silver, the powerful Assembly speaker, needed to be able to claim improvements in protecting the tenants of rent-regulated apartments, but that otherwise Silver wouldn’t be the immovable object he’d been in the past. “How many times did Nancy Pelosi, when she was speaker of the house, tell Obama to go to hell?” a top New York Democrat asks. “Not often. It doesn’t really work that way. And in Albany, a Democratic speaker doesn’t really want trouble with a Democratic governor. A Republican governor, Pataki — yes, then the Democratic speaker is the counterforce. An immature, eccentric governor, Spitzer? Sure. A weak governor, Paterson? Shelly consumes a weak governor. But right now you have a popular Democratic governor. Shelly doesn’t want to start a fight of who is more popular and who has more sway with the Assembly.” Once Silver got some incremental improvements in tenant laws he was willing to play ball on the property tax cap, the priority for Republican senate majority leader Dean Skelos. Which left the minor matter of gay marriage itself. The decisive votes needed to come from Skelos’s conference, which was split between two factions: A solid majority opposed to legalization who didn’t want to allow the vote to come to the floor, and a handful of undecideds who were fearful of being the 32nd “yes” that would put marriage over the top and expose them to the vengeance of the Conservative Party. Skelos, to the end, couldn’t make up his mind what he wanted to do. He could allow a vote and get the issue over with, thereby risking his party’s thin hold on the senate, or stall indefinitely, satisfying the bulk of his membership. “The Republican leadership has promised (Conservative Party Chairman) Mike Long that it won’t put the thumb on individual legislators to decide it,” a GOP insider said mid-week. “So they have these tortured conferences where people are pretty anguished. Senators say, ‘I don’t want to be a bigot, but my church and my priest say I shouldn’t be doing this!’ A significant portion of the meeting the other day was venting at Alesi, especially, and McDonald, who they felt broke the proctocol.” Alesi, in particular, wallowed in the spotlight after declaring he’d vote yes, and angered his fellow Republicans by saying he was voting on principle while they resorted to craven political calculation. “In the meetings, they told him, ‘Nobody holds it against you that you’re in favor of this issue or that issue, but who are you to go out and indict the whole conference? You’re full of shit! You’re portraying my serious wrestling with this issue as some kind of cavalier political thing, and I take great offense to that!’” All this pontificating took up many hours, and could have continued indefinitely. Cuomo knew from the beginning that Republicans would use questions about protecting religious institutions as a delaying tactic, and that he couldn't depend on Skelos to deliver the last votes. So Cuomo kept working on individual Republicans, and he strategically gave ground, until late Friday, when his last bit of concession on religious exemptions tipped the balance for Sen. Stephen Saland, who represents a district near Albany. Cuomo felt confident of Saland's vote a week ago, but knew he needed to give the senator slightly more room to justify the decision to the Republican conference and to his constituents. \\"You’ve got a governor who from New York City who shouldn’t be wildly popular upstate, but he is,\\" a Cuomo insider says. \\"So legislators take comfort in the fact that he’s out there so hard on this issue. You took a tough vote for David Paterson? Shame on you! You took a tough vote for Andrew Cuomo? God bless you!\\" The repeated, emphatic waving of campaign money by gay groups didn’t hurt, either. “It’s carrots and sticks. It’s music and champagne — and it’s strength,” a Cuomo intimate says. “It’s an orchestra, it’s a symphony, it’s all of this combined. It’s political skills. It’s 500 phone calls to individual senators. It’s birthday calls, it’s anniversary calls, it’s going to their district, it’s all last year campaigning with them.” “Andrew has been masterful,” a political strategist says. “Whether health care or ethics or Medicaid reductions, they announce victory, stand with the partners in a room — and then they work out the details later.” So it was with gay marriage; it will be some time until all the fine print is digested, and perhaps the last round of maneuvering will open up the law to serious legal challenges, but Cuomo will worry about that another day. He's gotten the big win, and it will be very hard for anyone to turn back the clock. (A digression: Yes, Mike Bloomberg has been a longtime and aggressive supporter of gay marriage, but otherwise he and the city took a beating in Albany this session. From LIFO to the slashing of education funds to the meager improvements in rent regulations to the punting of pension reductions, Cuomo has recognized and exploited his political advantages over the mayor at every turn . The state’s new reduction in union benefits may have a ripple benefit for Bloomberg, but it’s a big maybe. And okay, Bloomberg did get an Albany win on livery cabs.) ||||| Striking what advocates believe is a historic victory for gay rights, New York on Friday approved same-sex marriage, making the Empire State the sixth and largest state to allow gays and lesbians to marry. The 33-29 state Senate vote is an enormous victory for first-year Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who pledged during last fall’s campaign to push for gay marriage. It comes after an intense public and private lobbying campaign from a wide cast of politicians, celebrities and athletes, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former President Bill Clinton. Text Size - + reset Cuomo cheers marriage vote POLITICO 44 Cuomo, whose two daughters attended the vote in the Senate gallery, signed the bill five minutes before midnight after a victory lap press conference. It will go into effect July 24, and when it does, the population of Americans for whom same-sex marriage is legal will double. Cuomo after the vote said New York has continued its legacy as a beacon for social justice movements. “The other states look to New York for the progressive direction,” Cuomo said. “What we said today is, you look to New York once again. New York made a powerful statement, not just for the people of New York, but for people all across this nation.” After weeks of suspense, Stephen Saland, a Poughkeepsie Republican, announced himself on the Senate floor as the 32nd senator to back the legislation, tipping the balance in favor of it passing. Saland defined his vote as a matter of conscience during a stirring legal defense of an amendment exempting religious organizations from the law. “I have defined doing the right thing as treating all persons with equality,” Saland said. “And that equality includes the definition of marriage. I fear that to do otherwise would fly in the face of my upbringing.” Saland, who voted against gay marriage in 2009, was joined in announcing his newfound support for gay marriage on the senate floor by Mark Grisanti, a first-term Buffalo Republican who did not declare how he would vote until his floor speech Friday night. Grisanti, who said he struggled with the vote because he is Catholic, had been against same-sex marriage when he was elected last year, but changed his mind after an intense lobbying campaign, which included a call from Lady Gaga to her fans to contact him. “I cannot legally come up with an argument against same-sex marriage,” Grisanti said. Of the 33 senators to vote for the bill, 29 are Democrats and four are Republicans. Of the 29 who voted against it, all but one are Republicans. Cuomo, who is scheduled to speak at 11:15 p.m., lauded the vote in a press release. “New York has finally torn down the barrier that has prevented same-sex couples from exercising the freedom to marry and from receiving the fundamental protections that so many couples and families take for granted,” he said. “With the world watching, the Legislature, by a bipartisan vote, has said that all New Yorkers are equal under the law. With this vote, marriage equality will become a reality in our state, delivering long overdue fairness and legal security to thousands of New Yorkers.” The Senate bill’s sponsor, openly gay Democrat Tom Duane of Manhattan, introduced the legislation with a tearful speech detailing his life from when he came out to his Catholic parents as a teen to his adult life fighting for gay rights. He spoke of how his young nieces and nephews already consider he and his partner married, even if they are not in the eyes of the law. “Marriage says that we are family,” Duane said. “Louis and I are family. And marriage strengthens all family. It’s going to strengthen my family and all New York families.” The lone senator to speak against the legislation was Bronx Democrat Ruben Diaz Sr., a Pentecostal minister who is the body’s harshest critic of the legislation. Diaz blamed Senate Republicans, who voted en masse against legalizing gay marriage in 2009, for turning on the issue. “It is unbelievable that the Republican Party, the party that always defended family values ... is allowing a Democratic governor to divide the Republican Party and the Conservative Party,” Diaz said. “Same-sex marriage has been rejected by the majority of Americans when given the opportunity to vote for it.” And the National Organization for Marriage, which lobbied against legalizing gay nuptials, said the state Republican Party “has torn up its contract with the voters who trusted them in order to facilitate Cuomo’s bid to be president of the U.S.” |||||Summary:","completion":"New York State legalized same-sex marriage in a historic vote that marked a significant victory for Governor Andrew Cuomo, who had promised to push for gay marriage during his campaign.

The OPTIONS: (a). skillet had a lid and would cook faster.. (b). pan had a lid and would cook faster..","completion":"The package said to cook the meat in a skillet, but Sally decided to use a pan instead. She carefully weighed her options before making this decision. On one hand, the skillet had a lid and would cook the meat faster, allowing her to retain more of the natural juices, which would give her meal that authentic, home-cooked flavor. Additionally, the skillet’s even heat distribution would ensure the meat cooked evenly, reducing the risk of any rawness. However, Sally was never one to strictly follow instructions, especially when she felt there might be a benefit to deviating from them. Her choice to use a pan instead of a skillet came with its own practical reasoning. First and foremost, her pan had a lid, which, like the skillet, could significantly reduce cooking time. The primary distinction was that her pan was slightly deeper and had more surface area. This allowed for the possibility of adding more ingredients, which could elevate the dish and make it her own. She considered combining the meat with vegetables or potatoes, making it a one-pot meal that would be both delicious and easy to clean up. Moreover, Sally was conscious of the fact that non-stick coatings in some of the skillets might have potential health concerns, especially when exposed to high temperatures. By opting for a pan with a stainless steel or cast iron surface, she could cook her dish confidently without these worries. Additionally, using a pan would give her more control over the cooking process, as it had sturdier handles, and she could effortlessly monitor the meat while the lid was still on. Lastly, Sally believed that engaging in creative cooking could lead to discovering new methods and techniques, which might even turn out better than the traditional method. As a food enthusiast and risk-taker, she trusted her instincts and understanding of the ingredients. She knew that sticking too closely to a recipe's instructions might prevent her from being able to develop her own unique culinary style. In conclusion, Sally's decision to use a pan instead of a skillet was based on a multitude of reasons. From practicalities like having a lid for faster cooking times and the potential to add more ingredients, to her own culinary preferences like avoiding non-stick pans and the desire for creative freedom in the kitchen, Sally put great thought into her choice to cook the meat in a pan. The outcome of her decision may very well have resulted in a more customized, delicious dish, proving once again that sometimes deviating from the norm can lead to extraordinary results."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: The mighty fane, with its three massive towers, rises majestically over the red roofs of the town. Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

Cameraman Huw Walters allegedly forged his wife's signature to pay off £59,000 in debts. He denies three counts of fraud at Cardiff Crown Court. An award-winning cameraman forged his wife's signature to pay off £59,000 in debts, before divorcing her, a court heard. Huw Talfryn Walters, 50, allegedly spent the money on buying expensive camera and photographic equipment. But the court heard the freelance cameraman kept his spiralling money problems secret from his wife, Helen Bowen. The case was brought before a new jury after the original jury failed to reach a majority verdict in March this year. Cardiff Crown Court heard yesterday how Walters forged Miss Bowen's signature three times to take £59,000 from their joint mortgage on their marital home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff. During one application, he wrote: 'We need these funds urgently, so your speed in these matters would be welcome.' He then ended their 14-year marriage after telling his wife he needed to put their house up for sale. Walters allegedly told Miss Bowers: 'I'm divorcing you because if I don't I'm going to go bankrupt.' Prosecutor John Davies said: 'Miss Bowen made a career change around 2005 and after that left the mortgage and bills to her husband who she trusted. 'They separated in December 2011 and not long after that she became aware the mortgage had increased without her agreement. 'She contacted the bank to obtain copies of the three withdrawals which increased the size of the mortgage by £59,000. 'She realised the signatures on them didn't belong to her - they were written by her husband without her knowledge while they still lived together.' Freelance cameraman Walters has worked on programmes including the BBC Proms, Doctor Who and Channel 4's history show Time Team. He has won two Welsh Baftas for his cinematography and camera work in recent years. The court heard Walters spent thousands of pounds on expensive camera equipment. Mr. Davies told the jury: 'A total of £59,000 was acquired using the fake. signature of his then wife. He entered each signature having not. consulted her or asked to consent.' Scroll down for video. Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) heard how Walters forged Miss Bowen's signature three times to take £59,000 from their joint mortgage on their marital home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff. The court heard from a forensic handwriting expert, who proved Helen Bowen's signature had not been written by her - and was most likely written by her husband. Miss Bowers, a professional reflexologist, said she only discovered her husband had forged her signature a few months after their separation - when she was contacted by her mortgage provider. When asked if she agreed to the mortgage withdrawals, she replied: 'No, not at all. If I had been asked I would not have agreed to them.' Walters, now of Maesteg, in Bridgend, denies three charges of fraud. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

It was said that there less than 20 jaguars in the world, one of which was living in the national zoo of Peru. In order to help this jaguar, Peruvians set up a zoo for it, where there were sheep and deer for the jaguar to eat. However, strange enough, no one had ever seen the jaguar hunt the deer and sheep. What they could see was its lying in its cave, sleeping and eating the meat provided by the zoo keepers. At first, people thought that the jaguar felt too lonely, so they found a female tiger to accompany it. However, it did not make too much sense. The jaguar just sometimes went out of its cave with its \\"girlfriend\\" for a while before it came back to its house again' It is normal for the jaguar to be lazy here.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the fact that: The more basic a solution is, the closer its pH value will be to 14. Answer the question: Tanya was measuring pH values and recorded a value of 13 for Solution #1. She also recorded a value of 8 for Solution #2. Which solution is less basic Solution #2 or Solution #1? A:","completion":"Solution #2 is less basic than Solution #1. This statement is justified based on the understanding of the pH scale, which measures how acidic or basic a substance is. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. pH values less than 7 denote acidity while values greater than 7 indicate basicity or alkalinity. The farther a pH value is from 7 in either direction, the stronger the acid or the base. A pH value of 14 represents the most basic or alkaline substance, whereas a pH value of 0 represents the most acidic substance. Let's analyze the given pH values of solutions #1 and #2. Solution #1 has a pH value of 13. This is close to 14, which suggests that this solution is a strong base, or highly basic. Conversely, Solution #2 has a pH value of 8. Although this is still on the basic side of the scale (because it is above 7), it is much closer to neutral than to the maximum basic level of 14. Thus, we can derive that Solution #2, with a pH value of 8, is less basic than Solution #1, which has a pH value of 13. Although both solutions are basic (since their pH values are both above 7), the basic nature of Solution #2 is less intense compared to that of Solution #1. It's important to understand that pH is a logarithmic scale, meaning a change by a factor of 1 actually corresponds to a tenfold difference in basicity. Consequently, even the small difference in pH between 8 and 13 results in Solution #1 being 100,000 times more basic than Solution #2. Therefore, considering the characteristics and measures of the pH scale, we can confidently conclude that Solution #2 is less basic than Solution #1, despite both being considered basic solutions in their own rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Luzzatti was born of Jewish parents in Venice on 11 March 1841. After completing his studies in law at the University of Padua, he attracted the attention of the Austrian police by his lectures on political economy, and was obliged to emigrate after starting a mutual aid society among gondoliers. In 1863 he obtained a professorship at the Milan Technical Institute; in 1867 he was appointed professor of constitutional law at Padua, whence he was transferred to the University of Rome. Gifted with eloquence and energy, he popularized the economic ideas of Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch in Italy, worked for the establishment of a commercial college at Venice, and contributed to the spread of people's banks on a basis of limited liability throughout the country. He was minister of agriculture in the second Sonnino Cabinet (December 2, 1909 - March 21, 1910), and on the resignation of the latter was called upon to form a cabinet himself. His administration, which lasted until March 18, 1911, was not very successful and fell over a proposed electoral reform. Although a man of first-class financial ability, great honesty and wide culture, he had not the strength of character necessary to lead a government: he showed lack of energy in dealing with opposition and tried to avoid all measures likely to make him unpopular. Furthermore, he never realized that with the chamber, as it was then constituted, he only held office at Giolitti's good pleasure. During the First World War, he was consistently pro-Ally and strongly supported Italian intervention, but his tone was on the whole pessimistic. Although he did not take office while the war lasted, he was always consulted on all financial matters, and his sound advice was generally followed. He became treasury minister in the second incarnation of the Nitti cabinet (March 12 - May 10, 1920), but did not resume office in the third. At the general elections of May 1921, he decided not to stand for parliament again, and was made a senator. In spite of his advanced age, he continued to write on economic and financial problems with his accustomed lucidity and soundness of judgment, insisting on the necessity for Italy to return to free trade and to reduce government interference in business matters to a minimum. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he have high approval ratings?","completion":"The article does not explicitly mention Luzzatti's approval ratings, but it does provide insights into his leadership with the following quote: \\"Although a man of first-class financial ability, great honesty, and wide culture, he had not the strength of character necessary to lead a government: he showed lack of energy in dealing with opposition and tried to avoid all measures likely to make him unpopular.\\" This suggests that his approval ratings may not have been particularly high, as he struggled with strong leadership and faced challenges in dealing with opposition."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported.

Rikers Island and the Death of Kalief Browder The Justice Department and the City of New York are expected to reach an agreement this month on a reform plan that is intended to end the barbaric abuses that have long dominated the Rikers Island jail complex. But this agreement will come too late to save Kalief Browder, who was held at the jail for three years without trial, starting in 2010, when he was 16. The psychological trauma caused by spending about two of those years in solitary confinement at Rikers remained long after his release. On Saturday, Mr. Browder committed suicide at his family’s home in the Bronx. He was 22. Mr. Browder was accused of stealing a backpack, a charge he strongly denied. Partly because his family was unable to make bail, he remained at Rikers all that time, only to have the case dismissed. The beatings he suffered at the jail were captured on video that became public in April. In one incident, Mr. Browder is brutally assaulted by a guard; in another, he is attacked and beaten by a gang of inmates. He tried to kill himself several times. According to a lawsuit filed against the city on his behalf, his condition was made immeasurably worse by guards who sometimes denied him meals, medical care and bathing privileges — and fabricated disciplinary infractions to extend his stay in isolation. Last year, the city eliminated solitary confinement for adolescents at Rikers. The court system has put in place a new plan to shorten court delays and to prevent people from being held for lengthy periods without trial. These are important changes. But a serious, legally enforceable reform plan will be needed to remake what a damning Justice Department report issued last August described as a “deep-seated culture of violence” at the jail. The report called for a thorough overhaul of Correction Department operations and also recommended that adolescents be removed from Rikers and placed in a facility elsewhere. Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the State Legislature could alleviate a great deal of suffering — and bring New York into the 21st century — by passing a bill that would keep children under the age of 18 out of adult prisons. The Justice Department warned in August that the city would find itself in court if reforms were not quickly carried out. Federal prosecutors made good on that threat a few months later when they joined a pending class-action lawsuit, Nunez v. City of New York, which charges the Department of Correction with abetting violence by failing to discipline officers who participated in abuse. By joining a lawsuit that was already underway, federal prosecutors put themselves in a better position to get a court-monitored agreement that would produce enforceable, verifiable reforms. Mr. Browder’s death makes it all the more imperative that the reforms have teeth. A version of this editorial appears in print on June 10, 2015, on page A26 of the New York edition with the headline: The Death of Kalief Browder. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about Rikers Island, a big jail in New York, and a sad story of a young man named Kalief Browder. He was put in jail when he was 16 because people thought he stole a backpack, but he didn't have a chance to tell his side of the story in court for three years.

Q:WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton called Republican rival Donald Trump dangerous and unqualified for the presidency in a blistering foreign policy speech Thursday in San Diego, California. \\"He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,\\" Clinton said. \\"This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes.\\" Trump “doesn’t understand America, or the world,” she said. \\"It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.\\" In anticipation of the address, Trump attacked his Democratic opponent on Twitter. “Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin’ Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions,” he tweeted. Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. “National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA. With polls show terrorism is a major concern among Americans, Clinton targeted Trump's positions on the issue. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders. \\"The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies,\\" Trump said in a foreign policy speech in April. Trump's other anti-terrorism proposals include a pledge to torture and murder the families of suspected terrorists and target Islamic State. \\"I have a simple message for them,\\" Trump said. \\"Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. But they will be gone. And soon.\\" But... when will immigration policy change? - after Trump is elected - after Clinton is elected - not enough information - when America has spoken A:","completion":"Immigration policy change is a complex issue that depends on numerous factors, such as the political climate, the elected administration's priorities, and the urgency of the matter in the nation's eyes. To provide a more detailed analysis, I'll break it down based on the mentioned scenarios. 1. After Trump is elected: If Donald Trump were to be elected as President, it is highly likely that immigration policy changes would be a prominent issue on his agenda. Trump has been vocal about his strong views on immigration, especially regarding temporary bans on Muslim immigration and building a wall along the Mexico-US border. However, it is essential to understand that any proposed changes would need to pass through Congress, which may or may not approve such changes. Opposition from within his party, as well as across the aisle, could also impact the process. Furthermore, public opinion, court decisions, and lobbying groups can all have a significant influence on the scope and speed at which immigration policy changes are implemented. 2. After Clinton is elected: If Hillary Clinton were to become President, she would likely pursue a more measured approach to immigration policy. During her campaign, she emphasized comprehensive reform that would include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and an increase in refugee quotas. Clinton's approach to fortify the borders would rely on advanced technology and increased personnel to improve efficiency. In her case as well, any immigration policy change would be subject to congressional approval, public opinion, and lobbying groups. 3. Not enough information: As seen in both cases above, predicting exact timelines for immigration policy change is challenging due to the multitude of factors involved. The changes and their implementation will depend on the political landscape after the elections, the priorities of the winning administration, and the influence of public opinion and lobbying groups. 4. When America has spoken: Regardless of when changes in the immigration policy occur, it is crucial that these changes reflect the voice of the American people and uphold the core values of the nation. This means pursuing policies that balance the need for economic growth, national security, and the preservation of human rights. Ultimately, any changes to immigration policy should be the result of meaningful dialogue and careful consideration by legislators, interest groups, and American citizens, ensuring that decisions are made in the best interest of all involved parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: That would not be unusual. Here is a hypothesis: That would not be untypical. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, because both the premise and hypothesis are essentially conveying the same meaning, albeit with a slight variation in language. In this case, the main point of discussion is whether a particular occurrence or observation is unusual or untypical. To break it down further, we can examine the meanings of unusual and untypical: 1. \\"Unusual\\" means not habitually or commonly occurring or done, which implies that the object, event, or situation in question is not a common or regular occurrence. It deviates from the norm or expectation. 2. \\"Untypical\\" means not representative of a type, group, or class, indicating that the object, event, or situation does not conform to the standard characteristics or behavior patterns within a group or class. It is a deviation from the common or typical occurrences. Given these definitions, both \\"unusual\\" and \\"untypical\\" suggest that the object, event, or situation being described is outside the boundaries of common expectations, not fitting in with the norm. Now, let's examine the premise and the hypothesis: Premise: \\"That would not be unusual.\\" This premise states that the described object, event, or situation is not a rare or extraordinary occurrence. In other words, it's relatively common or normal within the context it is placed in. Hypothesis: \\"That would not be untypical.\\" This hypothesis claims that the object, event, or situation is not unique or distinct within its group, class, or type. Essentially, it is a shared characteristic or tendency within the group, class, or type. Based on the above analysis, we can infer that both the premise and the hypothesis allude to something being relatively common or typical. The premise suggests this by negating the term \\"unusual,\\" while the hypothesis negates the term \\"untypical.\\" They both express the idea that the specific object, event, or situation being described isn't fundamentally different from others in its respective group or category. Thus, if we accept the premise as true - that the object, event, or situation is not unusual - then we can conclude that the hypothesis - that it is not untypical - is also true. This is because both statements point towards the general agreement that the object, event, or situation being discussed is common or fitting within the norm or expectation of its respective group, class, or type."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

', ), officially the Republic of Belarus, formerly known by its Russian name Byelorussia (though this name is no longer used in Belarus itself, even in Russian language), is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia to the northeast, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the northwest. Its capital and most populous city is Minsk. Over 40% of its is forested. Its strongest economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the Principality of Polotsk (11th to 14th centuries), the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. - Lithuania (UK and US: ), officially the Republic of Lithuania, is a country in Northern Europe. One of the three Baltic states, it is situated along the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea, to the east of Sweden and Denmark. It is bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) to the southwest. Lithuania has an estimated population of 2.9 million people , and its capital and largest city is Vilnius. Lithuanians are a Baltic people. The official language, Lithuanian, along with Latvian, is one of only two living languages in the Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family. - A province is almost always an administrative division, within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman \\"provincia\\", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \\"outside the capital city\\". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy. - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north.

The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively.

It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. - The Principality of Polotsk, also known as the Kingdom of Polotsk or the Duchy of Polotsk, was a medieval principality of the Early East Slavs. The origin and date of state establishment is uncertain. The Russian chronicles mention Polotsk being conquered by Vladimir the Great, and thereafter it became associated with the Rurik dynasty and Kievan Rus'. - Napoleon Bonaparte (\\"Napoléon Bonaparte\\"; , born \\"\\"Napoleone di Buonaparte\\"\\"; 15 August 1769 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815.

One of the most dramatic changes in priorities proposed by the City Council would shift 25.6 million from funding for court-appointed lawyers to the Legal Aid Society. In a document released yesterday to justify its reordered priorities, the Council contended that Legal Aid can achieve greater economies of scale than lawyers appointed pursuant to Article 18-B of the County Law. The Council document also noted that \\"inexplicably\\" 18-B lawyers are handling 50 percent of the indigent criminal cases in New York City, even though their mandate is to handle only multi-defendant cases where the Legal Aid Society had a conflict. In past years, the City Council had consistently added 5.6 million to the 54.7 million proposed for the Legal Aid Society by former Mayor Giuliani, bringing the total to just a shade over 60 million. But this year for the first time, the Council is proposing shifting more than 20 million in funds earmarked by the Mayor for 18-B lawyers to the Legal Aid Society, which would increase its total funding to 80.4 million. That would reflect a jump in its current finding of about one-third. Meantime, the City Council proposed slashing the Mayor's allocation of 62.8 million for 18-B lawyers by 66 percent, to 21.4 million.

A show composed of a concert, circus acts, and broadway is taking place at a theater in the city. One of the stars of the show is a lady cat dancer whom Oswald suddenly has affection for upon seeing a poster. For admission, patrons have to pay 50 cents. Unfortunately for Oswald, his pockets are empty. Oswald notices a stage entrance where performers and certain officials can come in, and admission is unnecessary. Because of this, Oswald comes up with an idea of impersonating a performer by bulging his chest (possibly pretending to be a stuntman). The guard by the door isn't deceived and prevents the penniless rabbit from coming in. After a bit of a struggle, Oswald ties the guard to a lamp post and proceeds toward the inside of the theater. However, he is forced back outside by the glaring performers. While thinking of a way to get back in, Oswald sees a man in a thick fur coat coming out of a taxi and heading towards the theater entrance. Oswald hides under the man's shadow. As the man with the coat enters, the guard becomes suspicious upon noticing a lump on the shadow. Thinking he made it inside undetected, Oswald comes out but doesn't notice the guard approaching him.

News article: A personal injury lawyer trying to raise money for her lawsuits against Black Lives Matter and its leaders on behalf of Baton Rouge police officers was rejected by a crowdfunding website on Sunday. The YouCaring site is a free, online fundraising source for people around the country and in Baton Rouge, including residents whose lives were devastated by floods last year or families who have expensive medical needs. It also supports various versions of local and national Black Lives Matter campaigns. But when lawyer Donna Grodner, who has filed two federal lawsuits on behalf of police against Black Lives Matter that target one of its leaders Deray Mckesson, created a page to raise 20,000 for expenses, YouCaring took it down. “In alignment with our mission, we removed this fundraiser because it was not within our community guidelines around promoting harmony,” YouCaring chief marketing officer Maly Ly told the NewsHour Weekend in an email. “We are not the right platform to air grievances, or engage in contentious disputes or controversial public opinion.” Then, Grodner created a GoFundMe page. GoFundMe did not immediately return a request for comment. Grodner has filed two lawsuits that accuse Black Lives Matter and its leaders of causing the injuries of two police officers in separate incidents. READ NEXT: Baton Rouge officer wounded by lone shooter sues Black Lives Matter The first lawsuit was filed on behalf of an unnamed officer who said he was hit by debris during a protest after local police, who are white, killed 37-year-old Alton Sterling, a black man, on July 5 last year. Following Sterling’s death, Black Lives Matter organized a “Weekend of Rage” campaign, in line with type of take-to-the-streets rallies the movement has organized since its inception around 2012, to rail against the killings of black people. The lawsuit claims that Black Lives Matter and one of its leaders Deray Mckesson are responsible for the officer’s injuries, though Mckesson is not accused of throwing anything. It says the Black Lives Matter activists have incited violence and do not try to calm the crowds. A judge in that case is still deciding whether Black Lives Matter can be charged as an entity. Grodner filed a second lawsuit on Friday, but with four more leaders as defendants including Alicia Garza and Johnetta “Netta” Elzie, making a similar claim. The officer she is representing, also unnamed, was shot several days after the Weekend of Rage, by a man from Kansas City who law enforcement said had never attended any of the protests, according to local reports. A First Amendment lawyer told the NewsHour Weekend on Saturday that Grodner’s theory is bizarre and seems it may be an attempt to hunt for dirt within the movement rather than a legitimate legal claim. David Roland, the director of litigation at the Freedom Center of Missouri, also said it followed the same principle used in a Civil-War era law. “It’s the same logic that gets applied to people of the Muslim faith. If there’s an act of terrorism, people say, �?If you don’t come out and disavow this personally, then you are responsible,’” he said. Roland feared it was a shot across the bow and designed to discourage dissent. “Black Lives Matter and the people who are involved in it are engaged in civil disobedience because they perceive a fundamental wrong in our society that needs to be corrected,” Roland said. “The best method that they know to employ … is to engage in civil disobedience, and that’s part of a long American tradition.” Grodner’s GoFundMe page called the protesters militant, saying the money will help “hold them responsible for the injuries they caused, whether in whole or in part through its [anti]-police agenda.” In response to questions about YouCaring’s decision and the GoFundMe page, Grodner told the NewsHour Weekend in an email that “Both are for the same purpose.” But Ly said in her email that YouCaring was drawing a line. “We exist to empower people and communities to rally positive financial, emotional, and social support,” she wrote. “While different viewpoints are a part of life, you should make efforts to ensure that the content of your fundraiser does not promote discord.” ||||| × Baton Rouge officer sues Black Lives Matter over 2016 ambush of cops BATON ROUGE — A wounded officer’s lawsuit filed in federal court in Louisiana alleges Black Lives Matter and several of its leaders are responsible for last year’s ambush on law enforcement in Baton Rouge. The July 17, 2016, attack by gunman Gavin Long claimed the lives of two police officers and a sheriff’s deputy and wounded two deputies and an officer. Lawyers for one of the wounded law enforcement officers filed the complaint Friday in US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana against various arms of the Black Lives Matter movement and leaders including DeRay Mckesson and Johnetta Elzie. The complaint alleges Black Lives Matter and its leaders are responsible for the shooting because they “incited the violence against police in retaliation for the death (sic) of black men shot by police,” and “did nothing to dissuade the ongoing violence and injury to police.” “In fact, they justified the violence as necessary to the movement and war,” the complaint says. The person who filed the lawsuit is named in the complaint only as Officer John Doe Smith, but the lawsuit spells out the injuries of the officer, which are the same as Deputy Nick Tullier. It says he is 42 with two children and is permanently disabled as a result of the numerous injuries he suffered in the ambush. Smith, the complaint says, was shot through his abdomen, left shoulder and left side of his head. The shot to his abdomen “tore up his intestines,” requiring 16 surgeries and causing recurring infections. Medical staff must attend to the exit wound daily, it says. The shot to Smith’s head almost tore off his left ear, which needed to be sewn back on, the complaint says. His skull was shattered and he lost brain matter on the left side, in an area controlling communication. His left eye stays mostly closed with the eyeball turned outward, it says. “John Doe Police Officer was strong and vibrant and he has been struggling everyday, fighting to live, and fighting to get better,” the complaint says. It seeks at least 75,000 in compensatory damages. It is not clear why the officer filed the complaint under a pseudonym. Donna Grodner, the attorney for the officer who filed the suit, told CNN she wasn’t authorized to speak about the case. The Baton Rouge victims In the attack last July, Long waited for police near a Baton Rouge convenience store that was known as a favorite stop for patrol officers. Armed with a rifle, he fatally shot Officers Matthew Gerald, 41, and Montrell Jackson, 32, outside the store as soon as he saw them. Sheriff’s Deputy Brad Garafola, who apparently was responding to reports of a man with a rifle, heard the shots and took cover, but then ran to help one of the downed officers. That’s when Long opened fire, killing Garafola. Long then shot Officer Chad Montgomery, who had pulled up in front of the building. The bullet grazed his head. In a nearby parking lot, Sheriff’s Deputy Nicholas Tullier, then 41, was in his cruiser to run the tag on Long’s car when the gunman emerged from the woods and opened fire, shooting as he walked toward the vehicle. Tullier was shot once in the head and twice in the abdomen and was in a coma for months. Long took shots at another arriving deputy, Bruce Simmons, 51, shattering the bone from his elbow to his shoulder. Simmons now has a titanium rod in his arm. SWAT officers then arrived on scene and shot Long in the leg, causing him to fall to the ground. As Long reached for his weapon, five SWAT officers fired, killing him. Lawsuit: Black Lives Matter ‘declared war’ on police The complaint describes in detail numerous protests that erupted across the country over several years, spurred by the shooting deaths of black men at the hands of police, and lists instances of violence, looting and vandalism at protests in Ferguson, Missouri; Baltimore; McKinney, Texas; Dallas and Baton Rouge. The suit notes Mckesson’s involvement in Black Lives Matter, and it points to his participation in the protests and his appearances in the media when he was introduced as a leader of the movement or a protest organizer. When violence erupted at some of the protests, the complaint says, Mckesson and other Black Lives Matter leaders “failed to disavow the violence and urged its followers that violence was part of revolution,” the complaint says. “By embracing and supporting violence in protest that could have been conducted peacefully, BLM declared a virtual war on police,” it says. When reached for comment, Mckesson told CNN, “This is the second lawsuit an officer has filed against me from Baton Rouge. … I’m confident it has no merit.” Elzie had no comment, and other defendants from Black Lives Matter could not be immediately reached for comment. Baton Rouge ambush ‘mimicked’ Dallas attack Mckesson and Elzie were present for protests in Baton Rouge in July 2016 held in response to the officer-involved shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile near Minneapolis earlier that month. The suit says they came to protest and “to incite others to violence against police and other law enforcement officers.” Mckesson was arrested during the protests on July 9, though he told CNN days later the arrest was unlawful because he was complying with police requests to move back at the time. The lawsuit also says Long’s actions when he killed the Baton Rouge officers “followed and mimicked those of another BLM activist who killed several officers in Dallas just days earlier.” Five Dallas police officers were killed and seven others wounded on July 7 last year when a gunman opened fire on them during protests against the killings of Sterling and Castile. Investigators identified the Dallas gunman as Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, a military veteran who had served in Afghanistan. Johnson told police negotiators during a standoff that he was upset about recent police shootings and wanted to kill white people, especially white officers, the police chief said. His online history showed he visited and liked several websites dedicated to Black Lives Matter. Johnson was killed after a standoff with police. Long, who acted alone in the shooting, traveled to Baton Rouge after stopping in Dallas shortly after the shooting to get revenge for the recent killings, the complaint says, suggesting that Black Lives Matter encouraged the behavior. ||||| Black Lives Matter is a movement, not an organization that can be sued by a Louisiana police officer who was injured at a protest after a deadly police shooting, a prominent activist's attorney claims. DeRay Mckesson, a Baltimore-based activist and a co-defendant in a federal lawsuit filed by a wounded Baton Rouge police officer, was one of nearly 200 protesters arrested after the July 2016 shooting death of Alton Sterling, a black man shot and killed by a white officer during a struggle outside a convenience store. Mckesson's attorney, William Gibbens, said in a court filing that Black Lives Matter doesn't have a governing body, dues-paying members, bylaws, \\"or even a central location.\\" At best, the lawyer argued, it's a \\"community of interest.\\" \\"However, even as a community of interest, it would be nearly impossible to ascribe a single common purpose or interest to the hundreds of thousands of different people, many with different goals and motives, who have protested, posted online, or acted under the 'Black Lives Matter' banner,\\" Gibbens wrote. The unidentified officer claims a piece of concrete or \\"rock like substance\\" struck him in the face during a July 9 protest over Sterling's death. The officer's lawsuit says he lost teeth and received injuries to his jaw and brain. The suit doesn't accuse Mckesson of throwing anything, but it claims he \\"incited the violence\\" on behalf of Black Lives Matter. The suit also claims Mckesson \\"was in charge of the protests\\" and he was seen and heard giving orders. The officer's attorneys sued Mckesson individually but also served him and others with the suit as alleged \\"agents\\" of Black Lives Matter. Donna Grodner, an attorney for the officer, is urging U.S. District Judge Brian Jackson to deny Mckesson's requests to dismiss the case. Grodner describes Black Lives Matter as a \\"thriving, if not very wealthy, unincorporated association\\" that solicits donations and sells T-shirts for profit. \\"If Black Lives Matter does not exist, it should not be raising money or collecting millions in donations,\\" she wrote in a court filing. Mckesson, who declined to be interviewed Wednesday, has described himself as a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement. \\"No organization started the movement,\\" he said during an interview last year. The officer suing Mckesson is identified only as \\"Officer John Doe\\" in the suit, saying the anonymity is \\"for his protection.\\" A court filing last year cited the July 2016 sniper attack that killed five Dallas police officers and a shooting 10 days later that killed three law-enforcement officers in Baton Rouge as reasons for concealing the officer's identity. Mckesson was arrested near Baton Rouge police headquarters on a charge of obstructing a highway. East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar Moore said his office wouldn't prosecute roughly 100 protesters who were arrested on that same charge, including Mckesson. Mckesson and other protesters sued the city of Baton Rouge and local law enforcement officials over their arrests, accusing police of using excessive force and violating their constitutional rights. Last month, a federal judge preliminarily approved a proposed settlement of the class action. Mckesson is one of nearly 80 arrested protesters who are eligible for cash payments ranging from 500 to 1,000 if the settlement gets the court's final approval. Mckesson and Black Lives Matter also were named as defendants in a federal lawsuit that Larry Klayman — founder of the conservative group Freedom Watch — filed last year in Texas after the sniper attack on Dallas police officers. Klayman also sued former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other political figures, accusing the defendants of inciting a \\"race war\\" against police officers. Mckesson's lawyers argued Klayman should have known his claims were frivolous. A judge's ruling on June 2 said the plaintiffs didn't provide the court with any support for their \\"proposition\\" that Black Lives Matter is an entity capable of being sued. All of Klayman's claims against Mckesson and Black Lives Matter have been dismissed or withdrawn. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Given the background: Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations. and the situation: David was visiting Europe last summer. First he visited London. To his dismay, it was overcast all night. Then he flew to Rome. There the sky was as clear as you could get at night. David was very happy about it. Answer the following question: In Rome, would less or more infrared radiaton be emitted at night than in London? Answer:","completion":"In Rome, less infrared radiation would be emitted at night than in London. Step 1: Consider the given background information. The background tells us that the atmosphere emits infrared radiation due to its temperature. Clouds, which are made of water vapor (H2O), strongly absorb and emit infrared radiation. This means that on clear nights, Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights due to lower amounts of infrared radiation being emitted by the atmosphere. Step 2: Apply the background information to the specific situation. David visited London, where it was overcast all night. This means that there were clouds in the sky, which would result in a higher amount of infrared radiation being emitted due to their strong absorption and emission properties. Then, David went to Rome where the sky was clear at night. With no clouds to absorb and emit infrared radiation, the amount of infrared radiation emitted in Rome would be lesser than in London.

Background: Bobby Darin (born Walden Robert Cassotto; May 14, 1936 - December 20, 1973) was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and actor in film and television. He performed jazz, pop, rock and roll, folk, swing, and country music. He started his career as a songwriter for Connie Francis. Context: In the fall of 1959, Darin played \\"Honeyboy Jones\\" in an early episode of Jackie Cooper's CBS military sitcom/drama, Hennesey set in San Diego, California. In 1960, he appeared twice as himself in NBC's short-lived crime drama Dan Raven, starring Skip Homeier and set on the Sunset Strip of West Hollywood. In the same year, he was the only actor ever to have been signed to five major Hollywood film studios. He wrote music for several films in which he appeared. His first major film, Come September (1961), was a teenager-oriented romantic comedy with Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida and featuring 18-year-old actress Sandra Dee. They first met during the production of the film, fell in love, and got married soon afterwards. Dee gave birth to a son, Dodd Mitchell Darin (also known as Morgan Mitchell) on December 16, 1961. Dee and Darin made a few films together with moderate success. They divorced in 1967. In 1961 he starred in Too Late Blues, John Cassavetes' first film for a major Hollywood studio, as a struggling jazz musician. Writing in 2012, Los Angeles Times critic Dennis Lim observed that Darin was \\"a surprise in his first nonsinging role, willing to appear both arrogant and weak.\\" In 1962, Darin won the Golden Globe Award for \\"New Star of the Year - Actor\\" for his role in Come September.

Given the question: Title: Flimsy and falsely advertised Review: I received this balloon yesterday (the shipping was prompt, as promised). Even though the description mentioned that it contains or comes with helium, there was no helium. It was not inflated--just folded into an envelope.I took it to Party City where it proceeded to explode. The worker told me that mylar balloons are not supposed to rupture that easily--they are supposed to have a mechanism that prevents them from being overfilled. So this balloon is definitely not well made. Definitely wouldn't buy again. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: This product review conveys a negative sentiment. Step-by-step justification: 1. The reviewer mentions that the product was \\"flimsy and falsely advertised.\\" These words indicate dissatisfaction with the product's quality and description. 2. The product description mentioned that it contains or comes with helium, but the reviewer found that it did not. This shows that the product did not meet the expectations set by the seller, leading to disappointment. 3. The balloon exploded at Party City, and the worker informed the reviewer that mylar balloons should not rupture that easily.

What is the best way to: To make pizza without grains of any kind,","completion":"Alright, imagine we want to make a special pizza without any grains, like wheat, rice, or corn. Instead, we will use vegetables or cheese to create a base for our pizza. Here's a simple way to make a grain-free pizza: 1. Choose a base: You can use vegetables like cauliflower, zucchini, or even cheese like mozzarella to make the crust. Cauliflower is a popular choice for many people. 2. Prepare the base: - If using cauliflower, cut it into little pieces and blend it in a food processor. Cook it in the microwave for a few minutes to soften it. Then, squeeze out water with a towel. Mix it with some cheese and egg so it can stick together. - If using zucchini, grate it and do the same as with cauliflower. - If using cheese, just mix it with egg and any other seasoning you like. 3. Shape the crust: Place your mixture on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Press it down and shape it into a flat circle, just like a regular pizza crust. 4. Bake the crust: Put it in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 15-20 minutes, or until it turns golden-brown. 5. Add toppings: Now it's time for the fun part! Use your favorite pizza sauce and spread it on the crust. Then, add cheese and any other toppings you love, like, tomatoes, mushrooms, or bell peppers—just like you're decorating a picture! 6. Bake the pizza: Put your masterpiece back in the oven for about 7-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. 7. Cool and enjoy: Let your grain-free pizza cool down a little, then slice it and enjoy your creation! Remember, this is a simple version, and there are many more recipes to explore. Always ask an adult for help when using the oven or sharp tools, and remember to have fun in the kitchen!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In August 1558, Charles was taken seriously ill with what was later revealed to be malaria. He died in the early hours of the morning on 21 September 1558, at the age of 58, holding in his hand the cross that his wife Isabella had been holding when she died. Charles was originally buried in the chapel of the Monastery of Yuste, but he left a codicil in his last will and testament asking for the establishment of a new religious foundation in which he would be reburied with Isabella. Following his return to Spain in 1559, their son Philip undertook the task of fulfilling his father's wish when he founded the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. After the Monastery's Royal Crypt was completed in 1574, the bodies of Charles and Isabella were relocated and re-interred into a small vault directly underneath the altar of the famous Basilica of the Monastery, in accordance with Charles's wishes to be buried \\"half-body under the altar and half-body under the priest's feet\\" side by side with Isabella. They remained in this vault until 1654 when they were later moved into the Royal Pantheon of Kings by their great-grandson Philip IV, who, in doing so, disrespected his great-grandfather's wishes. On one side of the Basilica are bronze effigies of Charles and Isabella, with effigies of their daughter Maria of Austria and Charles's sisters Eleanor of Austria and Maria of Hungary behind them. Exactly adjacent to them on the opposite side of the Basilica are effigies of their son Philip with three of his wives and their ill-fated grandson Carlos, Prince of Asturias.

Q:Question: \\"What caused Edison's Amberol cylinder to fail?\\" Context: \\"In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Several factors contributed to Edison's Amberol cylinder failing in the market. 1. The first factor is the superior duration of disc records. In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced that could play for more than three minutes, and in 1903, 12-inch records were introduced that could play for more than four minutes. In contrast, contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. Even though Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, which had a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes, this was not sufficient to overcome the advantage of discs. 2. The second factor is the material of the cylinders. The original Amberol cylinders were made of celluloid, a plastic which was far less fragile than the materials previously used. However, this likely did not provide a notable advantage over disc records. 3. Finally, patent regulations also played a part in the failure of Amberol cylinder. By 1919, the basic patents for the manufacture of laterally-cut disc records had expired, which enabled countless companies to produce them. With competition increasing, the market for the Amberol cylinders dwindled. Despite Edison's attempts to innovate and improve his product, the advantage of disc records in terms of duration and the increased competition from other companies resulted in Edison's Amberol cylinder failing in the market. Edison continued to produce Blue Amberol cylinders until late 1929, but the product never got the desired market success."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: John Sculley for the following movie plot: Steve Jobs (Noah Wyle) is speaking with director Ridley Scott (J. G. Hertzler), about the creation of the 1984 commercial for Apple Computer, which introduced the first Macintosh. Jobs is trying to convey his idea that \\"We're creating a completely new consciousness.\\" Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the commercial. Next in 1997 with Jobs, returning to Apple, and announcing a new deal with Microsoft at the 1997 Macworld Expo. His partner, Steve Wozniak or \\"WOZ\\" (Joey Slotnick), is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \\"got from there to here,\\" the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple. The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \\"Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are.\\" Wozniak then comments that \\"Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he'd see karma or the meaning of the universe. Using a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University, in the early 1970s, with classmate Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio), and Gatesâ high school friend Paul Allen (Josh Hopkins). As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates' story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts's MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard. Gates' and Allen's early work with MITS is juxtaposed against the involvement of Jobs and Wozniak with the \\"Homebrew Computer Club\\". Jobs and Woz...

(CNN) -- The cause of Sunday's power outage at the Super Bowl in New Orleans has been traced to a newly installed electrical relay device meant to protect Superdome equipment, a power company and the device's manufacturer said Friday. But the companies appear to be on different pages about whether human error was to blame. The relay, put online late last year, triggered unexpectedly, causing another device to stop supplying power to part of the building, Entergy New Orleans told city officials Friday. The partial outage interrupted the game between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers for about 35 minutes, and city officials have been anxious about whether the outage will impact the city's efforts to attract future big-ticket events. \\"(An outside test) is clearly imperative ... to defy the naysayers that could be arising around the country to say that we shouldn't have this ( OPTIONS: - Baltimore Ravens).\\" - CNN).\\" - Entergy New Orleans).\\" - New Orleans).\\" - Outage).\\" - San Francisco 49ers).\\" - Super Bowl).\\" - Superdome).\\"","completion":"Imagine this story is like a fairy tale.

Document Processing: It appears that the IREX staff in Kazakhstan were responsible for handling your documents. After receiving them, they would have probably reviewed your paperwork for correctness and completeness to ensure they met all requirements and guidelines. 2. Document Submission: Once IREX staff had gone through your documents, they needed to be sent to Washington, D.C., as mentioned in the passage. The staff would have to ensure your documents reached their destination on time and were submitted to the appropriate authorities or organization in Washington, D.C. The tight deadline of just an hour suggests that the staff may have used an expedited mode of communication, such as a secure electronic transmission or express courier service, to meet the deadline. 3. Evaluation and Decision-making: After the documents were submitted to Washington, D.C., the relevant organization or authorities would have reviewed and evaluated your paperwork. This process would involve assessing the content of your documents, checking your eligibility and qualifications, and determining whether you met the necessary criteria for the program or opportunity you were applying for. 4. Notification of Results: Following the evaluation of your documents, you might have been informed about the results and decisions taken related to your application. This could include receiving an acceptance or rejection letter, an invitation to an interview, requests for additional information or documents, or any other steps that would be necessary to move forward. 5.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the massacre about which Weinberg writes a more likely explanation is that it \\"should be seen as looking forward to a future in which there might again be a Poland on the Soviet Union's western border\\"? from the following article ? Kozelsk and Starobelsk were used mainly for military officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers. Some prisoners were members of other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, landowners, and law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000-8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000-6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy).Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die. According to NKVD reports, if a prisoner could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude, he was declared a \\"hardened and uncompromising enemy of Soviet authority\\".On 5 March 1940, pursuant to a note to Joseph Stalin from Beria, six members of the Soviet Politburo — Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Mikhail Kalinin — signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish \\"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\\" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus.

A:","completion":"The name of the massacre about which Weinberg writes a more likely explanation is that it \\"should be seen as looking forward to a future in which there might again be a Poland on the Soviet Union's western border\\" is the Katyn Massacre. The Katyn Massacre refers to the mass execution of Polish officers, intellectuals, and other members of the Polish elite by the Soviet Union's secret police, the NKVD, in 1940. This event took place during World War II when the Soviet Union had occupied the eastern part of Poland following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany. The massacre's primary aim was to eliminate a significant portion of the Polish leadership and intelligentsia, thereby weakening any future Polish resistance and securing the Soviet Union's control over the region. Over 22,000 Polish victims were killed in the massacre, which was carried out in several locations, including the Katyn Forest, as well as the prisons and camps of Starobelsk, Kozelsk, and Ostashkov, among others. The victims included military officers, police officers, prison officers, gendarmes, priests, landowners, and members of the legal profession. The Soviet Union initially denied responsibility for the massacre, blaming the Nazis for the killings. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian government officially acknowledged the Soviet Union's responsibility for the Katyn Massacre and released classified documents related to the event. Gerhard Weinberg's explanation points to the strategic intention of the Soviet Union to weaken a potential future Polish military by eliminating a large portion of its leadership. This perspective suggests that the massacre was a preemptive measure taken by the Soviets to prevent the resurgence of a strong and independent Poland on its western border in the future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: The Silence of Lorna Movie plot: Lorna, a young Albanian woman living in Belgium, is in sham marriage with a drug addict named Claudy who accepted her money to become her husband. Lorna's dream is to own a snack bar with her boyfriend, Sokol. In order to see this dream fulfilled, she agrees to have another fake marriage with a Russian man, but Claudy is in the way. Fabio, the one who orchestrated the whole plan, will not wait for Lorna and Claudy's divorce. Initially Lorna had agreed to Fabio's plan of killing Claudy with an overdose. But Lorna is moved by Claudy's determination to stay clean, so she pleads Fabio to wait for their divorce. But Fabio does not understand why Lorna cares, and an overdose will not look suspicious, because drug addicts often relapse. Claudy attempts to stay off of drugs by locking himself in his apartment and asking Lorna to get him medicine at the pharmacy that will help with his pains. One night, the pain becoming unbearable, and he asks Lorna to call his doctor and take him to the hospital. There, he begs Lorna to stay with him until the nurse comes. He leans against her like a child in need of protection. In order to obtain a quick divorce, Lorna decides to hurt herself and make it look like Claudy abused her. She does not manage to convince Claudy to beat her and ends up hurting herself at the hospital and crying out for help. The nurse who looks after her agrees to act as a witness for the police report. The same day, Lorna goes to the station and fills out a report. Fabio, who seems to control everything, has her followed, and he asks her why she went to the police station. She explains that the divorce will be faster since she has found a way to make it look like Claudy is a physically abusive husband.

Inc. says it will phase out the sale of products and plants that contain pesticides linked to deaths of honey bees and other pollinators, becoming what is believed to be the largest retailer to take such a move. The company’s announcement comes days after the release of a study by the European Academies Science Advisory Council that said the agricultural use of neonicotinoid pesticides is harmful to a range of helpful insects and organisms, not just honeybees. The paper joins a long list of studies critical of the pesticides currently banned in Europe but widely used in North America. Agricultural groups and the chemical companies that make the pesticides say they are safe and effective protection against harmful insects if used properly, and that honeybee populations are thriving. But some beekeepers and scientists say the chemicals are killing bees and other insects by compounding the effects of virus-bearing mites and other threats. North Carolina-based Lowe’s said the studies on neonicotinoids are inconclusive, and it was taking the steps “out of an abundance of caution.” In its 2014 Report on Social Responsibility released on Thursday, the company said it will work with the growers of its plants to eliminate the use of neonics and phase out within two years sales of lawn and garden pesticides that contain neonics. “Our direction regarding neonics doesn’t imply that there is anything wrong or unsafe with our current products,” said Karen Cobb, a spokeswoman for the store that has 1,840 outlets in North America. “Products available at Lowe’s are U.S. EPA-approved to be safe and effective when used according to manufacturer’s directions.” Ontario last month said it planned to have rules in place by this summer that would reduce by 80 per cent the use of neonics on corn and soybean by 2017. The regulations would restrict the prophylactic use of seed treatments in an effort to ensure they are used only in areas prone to crop-destroying insects. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said last week it will no longer approve new uses for neonics pending further study of the effects on bees and other pollinators. Environmental group Friends of the Earth last year released a study that showed 51 per cent of the plants and flowers sold at major garden stores in Canada and the United States contained neonics. “All of those plants were labelled ‘bee friendly,’ but were treated without any warning to consumers,” said Tiffany Finck-Haynes of Friends of the Earth. Home Depot has said it would begin labelling plants that contained or were grown using the pesticides. “We offer our customers the ability to choose from a variety of lawn and garden products and currently carry over 40 environmentally preferred alternatives. In addition we are actively working with our live goods suppliers to find alternative insecticides for protecting live goods and bees,” Home Depot said in an e-mail on Thursday. “What makes Lowe’s unique is they are the largest retailer [to] make a time-bound commitment, whereas Home Depot said they are labelling their plants and working with their suppliers to find safer alternatives, [but] they haven’t made any time-bound public commitments on how they are actually phasing out neonics on their plants and on their off-the-shelf products,” Ms. Finck-Haynes said by phone. Bayer, which makes neonic-based pesticides used by farmers and gardeners, did not respond to an interview request. ||||| CHICAGO Home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc will stop selling a type of pesticide suspected of causing a decline in honeybee populations needed to pollinate key American crops, following a few U.S. retailers who have taken similar steps last year. The class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, or neonics, are sold by agrichemical companies to boost yields of staple crops but are also used widely on annual and perennial plants used in lawns and gardens. Scientists, consumer groups, beekeepers and others say bee deaths are linked to the neonic pesticides. The bee die-off is worrisome for agriculture because honeybees pollinate plants that produce about a fourth of the food consumed by Americans. Lowe's said it will phase out neonics in shelf products and plants by the spring of 2019, as suitable alternatives become available. A study released by environment group Friends of the Earth and Pesticide Research Institute in 2014 showed that 51 percent of garden plants purchased at Lowe's, Home Depot and Walmart in 18 cities in the United States and Canada contained neonicotinoid pesticides at levels that could harm or even kill bees. In 2014, the White House announced a plan to fund new honeybee habitats and to form a task force to study how to reverse the honeybee declines. Last year, BJ's Wholesale Club, a warehouse retailer said it was asking all of its vendors to provide plants free of neonics by the end of 2014 or to label such products. Home Depot, the largest U.S. home improvement chain, also asked its suppliers to start labeling any plants treated with neonics and that it was running tests in several states to see if suppliers can eliminate neonics in their plant production without hurting plant health.

There are no dance schools in Glenwood and Lauryn says goodbye to her brother, Joel (John Reardon) before departing for Chicago to audition for a famous dance school, the fictional Chicago School of Music and Dance. Although Joel, who works as a mechanic in the family garage, is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a friendly waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and out of the pouring rain. Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner. Brenda hires Lauryn as a bookkeeper, in light of her skills with numbers. Lauryn watches as a dancer, Carmen (Julissa Bermudez) performs impressively on the stage. Before locking up late one night, Lauryn goes on the stage and silently and elegantly dances, while unbeknownest to her, Russ watches from a distance. The next night, Brenda finds herself short of dancers. Russ asks Lauryn to dance, after having seen her graceful performance the previous night. Lauryn reluctantly agrees, and goes on stage. At first, new to the sexy routine, Lauryn looks foolish, but when Russ starts playing hip-hop music, Lauryn does a sexy hip-hop routine, and finds herself to be Ruby's new star.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The salt water is heated - As the saltwater is heated the water becomes a gas - The salt particles sink to the bottom of the container - Gaseous water is piped into another container - Allowed to cool - The salt particles are left behind in the first container - The second container contains fresh water. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more pressure on rocks happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The process you've described is a simple method of desalination, which involves heating saltwater to produce water vapor and then condensing the vapor in a separate container to obtain fresh water, leaving the salt behind. The perturbation hypothesis you've mentioned involves applying more pressure on rocks, and we will examine whether this affects the desalination process. A: From the given desalination process, there seems to be no direct effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the salt removal. The process of desalination relies on differences in temperature (heating and cooling) to separate the salt from the water. Applying more pressure on rocks will not have any immediate or observable direct effect on the rate of salt removal through this specific desalination method. However, if we consider the impact of increased pressure on rocks in a larger geological context, there may be an indirect effect. Increased pressure on rocks can lead to tectonic movements, which could, in turn, lead to changes in the distribution and concentration of salt in underground and surface waters. For instance, geological uplifts and shifts might expose new sources of salt deposits, potentially increasing the salinity of the surrounding water. In such a case, the increased salinity would require more energy and time for the desalination process to separate salt from water effectively. Under these circumstances, the efficiency of the simple desalination process would be indirectly affected by the perturbation. In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis of increased pressure on rocks doesn't directly affect the desalination process, it can potentially have an indirect effect by altering the salinity of water through geological changes. This would, in turn, require more energy and time to remove the salt from the water using the described process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Against yen, it slipped to 103.66, the lowest level since April 1. Market analysts contemplate the possibility of dollar-euro exchange rate reaching 1.35 and 100 yen within months.","completion":"This is about the recent decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against two major global currencies, the euro and the Japanese yen. The event outlines a significant milestone, as the dollar has reached its lowest exchange rate against the euro and the yen since specific dates mentioned in the description. This currency fluctuation could impact various aspects of the global economy, and market analysts are exploring the potential future scenarios for the dollar-euro and the dollar-yen exchange rates. The U.S. dollar has experienced a notable depreciation, reaching an all-time low of 1.3068 per euro on Wednesday. This exchange rate signifies that one would now require a larger amount of U.S. dollars to buy a single euro compared to past rates. This depreciation of the dollar against the euro can affect international trade, investments, and other economic activities involving these currencies. Exporters and importers, for example, would have to reconsider their growth strategies and pricing in response to the changed exchange rate, as the cost of goods and services would effectively change for each currency zone. In a similar vein, the U.S. dollar has depreciated against the Japanese yen to reach a rate of 103.66, marking the lowest level since April 1. Again, this development changes the dynamics of economic and financial activities between the United States and Japan. Both countries are prominent economic players, and such fluctuations in currency values can influence various industries, companies, and individual financial decisions. Market analysts are now assessing the potential implications of these recent declines, contemplating the possibility of the dollar-euro exchange rate reaching 1.35 per euro and the dollar-yen rate falling to 100 yen within the span of a few months. Based on economic indicators, global events, and market sentiments, analysts develop projections for future exchange rates. These projections are far from certain, but they offer valuable insights that help investors, policymakers, and businesses in making informed decisions. If the dollar continues to depreciate at these rates, it could have various consequences for the economies involved. A weaker U.S. dollar can make exports from the United States more competitive, potentially boosting American businesses and contributing to domestic economic growth. Conversely, imports would become more expensive, leading consumers and businesses to reconsider their purchasing decisions. This currency trend may also have a negative impact on the purchasing power of American travelers visiting Europe or Japan and vice versa, as their respective currencies' values would have changed. Another possible outcome of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar is its effect on investment decisions. Investors might reevaluate their portfolios, moving away from dollar-denominated assets to seek opportunities in other currencies or asset classes. Moreover, central banks and governments in Europe, Japan, and the United States may have to reevaluate their monetary policies to manage these exchange rate fluctuations and address potential economic risks. In conclusion, the recent all-time low of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the yen has generated market concerns and economic implications across the globe. Market analysts are closely observing trends and speculating potential future scenarios, such as the dollar-euro exchange rate reaching 1.35 and the dollar-yen rate touching 100 yen within months. This situation may continue to have a significant impact on international trade, investments, and policymaking, as businesses, governments, and consumers adapt to the changing currency landscape."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How can you get permanent marker stains off your body?","completion":"To get permanent marker stains off your body, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Test the affected area: Before attempting any removal methods, make sure your skin is not sensitive or allergic to any of the products you plan to use. Test a small, inconspicuous area of your skin first to ensure it does not cause irritation or redness. 2. Soap and water: Start with the most basic and gentle method. Wet the affected area with water and apply a mild soap, like hand soap or dish soap. Rub it gently on the stain and rinse with water. Sometimes, this can be enough to remove the marker if the stain is fairly new. 3. Alcohol or acetone: If soap and water doesn't work, you can try using rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, or nail polish remover containing acetone. Apply a small amount of the product on a cotton ball or soft cloth and gently rub the stain in a circular motion. The alcohol or acetone will help dissolve the marker ink, making it easier to remove. 4. Baby oil or oil-based makeup remover: Another option is to use baby oil or an oil-based makeup remover. Apply a small amount to a cotton ball or soft cloth and gently rub the stain. The oil can help break down the ink, allowing it to be removed more easily. 5. Baking soda and water: You can also create a paste by mixing baking soda with a small amount of water. Apply the paste onto the stained area and rub it gently with a soft cloth or your fingers. The abrasive nature of the baking soda can help lift the ink from the skin, but be cautious not to irritate your skin. 6. Keep the area moisturized: Regardless of the method you choose, it's important to keep the affected area moisturized, as some of these methods can be drying to the skin. Apply a gentle moisturizer or lotion after each attempt to remove the stain. 7. Time and patience: If the stain is stubborn and not completely removed with the above methods, remember that with time and the natural process of skin cell turnover, the permanent marker will eventually fade away on its own.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. now, we will explain how the 5htp can reduce your appetite. Write the above sentence using proper case.","completion":"Now, we will explain how 5-HTP can reduce your appetite. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is a naturally occurring amino acid and a chemical precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin. Serotonin plays a significant role in regulating mood, anxiety, and appetite, among other things, in the human body. By increasing the levels of serotonin, 5-HTP can directly impact appetite reduction and weight management. The process begins with the conversion of tryptophan, an essential amino acid found in protein-rich foods, into 5-HTP. Once produced, 5-HTP crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted into serotonin in the brain. It is worth noting that unlike 5-HTP, serotonin itself cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, which is why taking 5-HTP supplements can be more effective in increasing serotonin levels within the brain. The mechanism by which 5-HTP reduces appetite can be explained through the role serotonin plays in controlling hunger and satiety. Serotonin acts on specific receptors within the hypothalamus, a region of the brain responsible for controlling appetite, body temperature, and other homeostatic processes. These specific receptors, known as 5-HT2C receptors, are the primary target for appetite modulation. When serotonin binds to these receptors, it helps promote a sense of fullness and satiety, ultimately leading to a decrease in overall food intake and a reduction in appetite. Moreover, increased levels of serotonin have been associated with improved mood and reduced anxiety, which can also contribute to a decrease in emotional eating and cravings for unhealthy foods. This is particularly important for individuals who tend to overeat in response to stress or negative emotions. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of 5-HTP supplementation on appetite and weight loss. Results consistently show that individuals who take 5-HTP experience a greater reduction in appetite and subsequent weight loss when compared to those who take a placebo. Research also suggests that the weight loss effects of 5-HTP are more pronounced in overweight or obese individuals. It is important to note that while 5-HTP may be beneficial in reducing appetite, it should not be considered a standalone solution for weight management. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and a healthy lifestyle are still essential components in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. Furthermore, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement, especially for individuals currently taking medications or those with existing health conditions. In conclusion, 5-HTP has the potential to reduce appetite by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, which in turn influences feelings of satiety and fullness. This can help individuals control their food intake and ultimately support weight management efforts. However, it is important to emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to weight loss, including a healthy diet and regular physical activity, to achieve long-term success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge, KCB (5 March 1879 - 16 March 1963) was a British economist who was a noted progressive and social reformer. He is best known for his 1942 report Social Insurance and Allied Services (known as the Beveridge Report) which served as the basis for the post-World War II welfare state put in place by the Labour government elected in 1945. He was considered an authority on unemployment insurance from early in his career, served under Winston Churchill on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created labour exchanges and later as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Food. He was Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of University College, Oxford. After leaving university, Beveridge initially became a lawyer. He became interested in the social services and wrote about the subject for the Morning Post newspaper. His interest in the causes of unemployment began in 1903 when he worked at Toynbee Hall, a settlement house in London. There he worked closely with Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb and was influenced by their theories of social reform, becoming active in promoting old age pensions, free school meals, and campaigning for a national system of labour exchanges. In 1908, now considered to be the United Kingdom's leading authority on unemployment insurance, he was introduced by Beatrice Webb to Winston Churchill, who had recently been promoted to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. Churchill invited Beveridge to join the Board of Trade, and he organised the implementation of the national system of labour exchanges and National Insurance to combat unemployment and poverty. During the First World War he was involved in mobilising and controlling manpower. After the war, he was knighted and made permanent secretary to the Ministry of Food. In 1919 he left the civil service to become director of the London School of Economics and Political Science. Over the next few years he served on several commissions and committees on social policy. He was so highly influenced by the Fabian Society socialists - in particular by Beatrice Webb, with whom he worked on the 1909 Poor Laws report - that he could readily be considered one of their number. He published academic economic works including his early work on unemployment (1909) and a large historical study of prices and wages (1939). The Fabians made him a director of the LSE in 1919, a post he retained until 1937. During his time as Director, he jousted with Edwin Cannan and Lionel Robbins, who were trying to steer the LSE away from its Fabian roots. In 1933 he helped set up the Academic Assistance Council. This helped prominent academics who had been dismissed from their posts on grounds of race, religion or political position to escape Nazi persecution. In 1937, Beveridge was appointed Master of University College, Oxford. What did he work on at the London School of Economics and Political Science?","completion":"When William Beveridge was at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), he worked on several social and economic policies. He published academic works on unemployment and a big study on prices and wages. He was also involved in commissions and committees for social policy. As a director of the LSE, he helped set the direction of the school, sometimes having debates with other people who wanted to change its focus. In simpler words, at LSE, he worked on understanding how to help people with no jobs and studied how much things cost and how much people were paid. He also helped make important decisions for the school and worked with others to improve society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.)

When interacting with prospective customers, make sure to ask specific questions about their interest in the purchase and ensure their responses align with the product or service being offered. Additionally, stick to using reputable payment channels, such as PayPal or well-known bank platforms, guaranteeing a secure and protected transaction. Keep track of any transaction-related documentation, including invoices, shipping receipts, and tracking information to minimize the risk of disputes and scams from occurring. Another effective method to prevent fraudulent activities is to familiarize yourself with the warning signs and red flags that are commonly associated with online scams. These can include unusual buyer requests (such as requests for shipping to a non-existent address or overseas location which was not listed in your shipping agreement), last-minute changes to the agreed-upon terms, or a request for upfront payment to expedite the shipping process. Additionally, beware of buyers who try to communicate directly outside of the established platform (e.g., direct email or text messages) without your consent, as it may be an attempt to bypass the platform's security measures and engage in fraudulent activities. It's also a good practice to educate yourself on the policies and security measures implemented by the online marketplace in which you are operating. Ensure that you adhere to their guidelines, as this can offer you added security and protection in the event of a dispute or potential scam. Furthermore, if you do suspect a buyer is attempting to defraud you, report them to the online marketplace immediately, so they can take necessary actions to investigate and mitigate any fraudulent activities. In conclusion, prevention is key when it comes to safeguarding yourself against online scams when selling products or services across various platforms. By engaging in critical thinking, staying informed, practicing vigilance, and following the guidelines presented above, you can greatly reduce your risk of falling prey to online scammers.

The Justice League is summoned and Superman's x-ray vision confirms Luthor's reversed organs indicate that he is from a parallel Earth and that the evil Luthor is still incarcerated at Stryker's Island. The Justice League take the alternate Luthor to the Watchtower, where they learn of the Syndicate threat. As the Justice League debates the matter, Luthor hides the Quantum Trigger on the satellite. With the exception of Batman, the rest of the Justice League (Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash and Martian Manhunter) travel to Luthor's Earth. Arriving at the parallel Justice League's base, the heroes attack Syndicate targets. After a successful series of raids in which they capture Ultraman, the League confront United States President Slade Wilson, who releases Ultraman and explains that acceding to the Syndicate's demands saves millions of lives. His daughter, Rose, however, regards him as a coward. Martian Manhunter inadvertently reads her mind and explains that as a military man her father actually holds life more dear than others. Martian Manhunter foils an assassination attempt on Rose and the pair fall in love. Owlman has developed a weapon, the Quantum Eigenstate Device or Q.E.D., which the Syndicate intend to use as the...

Family members should be able to marry to avoid inheritance tax, he says. Declares in Big Issue interview: 'I quite fancy my brother!' Plans have tonight cleared the Commons, despite efforts to derail legislation.","completion":"Title: Former Tory Chairman Raises Eyebrows as Controversial Opinions Stir the Political World Introduction: The political sphere is never short of dramatic moments, but the recent remarks by the former Tory chairman have caught the attention of many. With shocking comments targeting party leadership, advocating for unconventional marriage, and even a bizarre confession, the ex-chairman's words have fueled heated discussions and impacted the legislation. Body: 1. Unleashing Frustration on Party Leadership In a foul-mouthed attack, the former Tory chairman criticized the party's leadership, warning that disaffected Conservatives will be drawn to UKIP as a result. The sharp criticism on the way the party is being managed creates an atmosphere of tension and reveals underlying issues that could affect the party's unity moving forward. 2. Family Marriage and Inheritance Tax A controversial proposition by the ex-chairman is to allow family members to marry in order to avoid inheritance tax. This suggestion, though unconventional, highlights the chairman's apparent concerns about the current taxation system and its impact on families. As the debate on inheritance tax intensifies, unexpected proposals such as this may create further rifts within political circles. 3. Confession in The Big Issue Interview Adding fuel to the controversy, the former Tory chairman declared in a Big Issue interview, \\"I quite fancy my brother!\\" While the comment may be seen as provocative or light-hearted, it has certainly drawn public attention and raised questions about the true intent behind the statement. 4. The Impact on Legislation Despite the efforts to derail legislation, plans have cleared the Commons tonight, further demonstrating the powerful influence that high-profile political figures can exert on the legislative process. The former chairman's inflammatory opinions may serve as a catalyst to spark serious conversations about the party's future direction and the necessary changes required for the betterment of the country. Conclusion: The former Tory chairman's opinions, though controversial, have certainly set the political world abuzz. As debates rage on, the party will need to assess the impact of such remarks on its unity, legislative goals, and leadership. Although the true motives behind the ex-chairman's words may never be fully understood, they serve as a stark reminder that bold claims can shake the status quo and stimulate much-needed conversations in the political realm."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Martin Brodeur was born on May 6, 1972, in Montreal. He was one of five children of Denis and Mireille Brodeur. Denis played in the 1956 Olympics for Team Canada and won a bronze medal. After his playing career, Denis was a longtime photographer for the Montreal Canadiens. After a year of success, the Devils were in the middle of the pack for most of the 1995-96 season and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 74 of his team's 82 games, setting a single-season record for most minutes played by a goalie, while having the 2nd-most shutouts (6) in the league. He was named the starter in the All-Star Game for the Eastern Conference and stopped all 12 shots he faced. He finished fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy, which is awarded to the league's top goaltender. Brodeur also played on Team Canada during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal finals. In the 1996-97 season, the Devils finished 3rd in the NHL. Brodeur was runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, was named to the All-Star team, and had the lowest goals against average by a goalie in almost 30 years, earning him the Jennings Trophy. He also had 10 shutouts and a .927 save percentage. On April 17, 1997, in the first game of a first-round playoff matchup against the Montreal Canadiens, Brodeur fired the puck the length of the ice and into the Canadiens' empty net to ensure a 5-2 victory. It was only the second time in NHL history that a goaltender had scored in the playoffs, and the fifth time overall. The Devils went on to win that series, but lost in the second round to the rival New York Rangers. The following year, Brodeur had 43 wins and 10 shutouts in the regular season. The Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the eighth-seeded Ottawa Senators. Once again, Brodeur made the All-Star Team, finished as a runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, and won the Jennings Trophy. In the 1998-99 season, the Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference for the third straight year, with Brodeur winning 39 games. He was among the contenders for the Vezina Trophy and started in the All-Star game, making his fourth appearance. However, the Devils lost in the first round to the Penguins. It was Brodeur's worst playoff performance to date statistically, as he allowed 20 goals in seven games with an .856 save percentage. Did he receive any awards for that year?","completion":"In 1998-99 season, Martin Brodeur did not win the Vezina Trophy, but he was one of the contenders for it, which means he was recognized as one of the top goalies in the league that year. He was also selected to be a part of the All-Star Game and started in it, making his fourth appearance in the special game where the best players in hockey come together and have fun. Although his team, the Devils, didn't do well in the playoffs that year, being a contender for the Vezina Trophy and playing in the All-Star Game show that Martin Brodeur was still an excellent goalie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I2a1b1, or more formally known as L621, is a genetic haplogroup within the Y-chromosome Haplogroup I, which is a marker in male lineage. Y-chromosome haplogroups are used to trace paternal lineages and can provide insights into human population migrations, ancient ethnic group relationships, and the history of specific lineages. I2a1b1 (L621) represents one particular subclade or branch on the human Y-DNA family tree. Before diving into the distribution of I2a1b1, it is worth mentioning that the original answer mentioned I2a2 as opposed to I2a1b1. I2a2 is a different subclade and should not be confused with the I2a1b1 in the context of the question. The two subclades have distinct genetic markers and geographical distribution patterns. Coming back to I2a1b1, this subclade is predominantly found in Southeastern and Eastern Europe. Given that this haplogroup is the focus of the question, the distribution of I2a1b1 should be explored further. A few of the primary regions with high concentrations of I2a1b1 are: 1. The Dinaric Alps: This area has been recognized as the primary hotspot for I2a1b1, where it reaches its highest frequency in the Balkans. The Dinaric Alps span across several countries in Southeastern Europe, including Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Albania. 2. The Western Balkans: Countries in the Western Balkan region, including Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia, also exhibit a significant concentration of I2a1b1. 3. Slavic-speaking populations: I2a1b1 is significantly present among Slavic populations, particularly the South Slavs, which include ethnic groups such as Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks, Montenegrins, Macedonians, and Slovenes. In conclusion, I2a1b1 (L621) is found in the highest concentrations in Southeastern Europe, particularly among populations inhabiting the Dinaric Alps and the Western Balkans, as well as among South Slavic populations. This distribution can be used to determine the haplogroup's evolutionary history and the migrations it has undergone over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read this article and answer this question The Peoples Party – known as the Peoples Revolutionary Party between 1924 and 2010 – formed the government from 1921 to 1996 (in a One-party state until 1990) and from 2000 to 2004. From 2004 to 2006, it was part of a coalition with the Democrats and two other parties, and after 2006 it was the dominant party in two other coalitions. The party initiated two changes of government from 2004 prior to losing power in the 2012 election. The Democrats were the dominant force in a ruling coalition between 1996 and 2000, and an almost-equal partner with the Peoples Revolutionary Party in a coalition between 2004 and 2006. An election of deputies to the national assembly on 28 June 2012 resulted in no party having an overall majority; however, as the Democratic Party won the largest number of seats, its leader, Norovyn Altankhuyag, was appointed Prime Minister of Mongolia on August 10, 2012. In 2014, he was replaced by Chimediin Saikhanbileg.

I read this background article the other day: A plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots. If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied... I am facing a new situation today: Two farmers provide a neighboring city with plenty of produce every year. Brick farm has a lot of plant problems, their plants experience abiotic stress. Boulder farm had a good production because their plants presented almost no signs of abiotic stress.

High concentrations of Na+ can decrease the plant's capacity to take up water and alter enzyme and transporter functions.

Shaun Maloney's sublime goal 15 minutes from the end of a tight, nip-and-tuck qualifier with the Irish completed a memorable and crucial Euro 2016 victory. Drawing level with the Republic on seven points after Poland's emphatic 4-0 win in Georgia, the Scots secured all three points in a frenetic clash. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch. Shaun Maloney (left) celebrates as Steven Naismith (centre) gives chase after Scotland open the scoring. Strachan will now ring the changes for Tuesday's friendly with England after admitting the game wrung every ounce of effort from his men. 'I think so,' confirmed the Scots boss. 'They put so much into that game tonight. That was like one of those big heavyweight boxing matches. 'I absolutely wouldn't second-guess the outcome of this group now.' The Scots had some sterling individual displays in goalscorer Maloney and man-of-the-match Charlie Mulgrew, called into midfield after an illness to James Morrison before the game. 'Charlie was immense, absolutely immense,' said Strachan. 'Normally we would come in here and say: 'What a game Scott Brown has had'. But Charlie has actually taken the mantle tonight and ably backed up by the people round about him. Scotland manager Gordon Strachan celebrates on the touchline at full-time as his side win 1-0. 'I am really pleased with Shaun as well, as I am with Steven Naismith, Ikechi Anya and others but Charlie was the best man on the pitch I think — ably backed by the others. 'But the smaller ones like Andrew Robertson, Maloney, Naismith and Anya showed brave play when the ball was flying about and there were tackles everywhere. 'They showed bravery on the ball.' Poland's triumph in Tblisi ramped up the pressure on the Scots before kick-off. Strachan had dismissed talk of a 'must-win' beforehand, but the joyous celebrations of the Tartan Army afterwards told another tale. 'People have been telling me since the Georgia game it is must-win,' the Scotland boss said. 'They said it before Poland and this one. Every game seems to be a must-win. 'I said before the game that one goal had decided all of the previous games in the group, apart from the one involving Gibraltar. It has happened again. 'We did say set plays were going to be vital and it happened. 'As for a pure footballing spectacle, it wasn't that great. Maloney curls a low strike into the far corner as Scotland take the lead in Glasgow on Friday. 'But as a spectacle of two groups of players not wanting to give an inch, it was mesmerising. They all wanted to jump higher than each other, run quicker and battle harder.' The Scots blew a raft of chances in both halves and survived a moment of anxiety in injury time when Grant Hanley's defensive header almost spun into his own net, crashing off the bar. Insisting his team now believe in themselves after one defeat in four matches — to world champions Germany in the opener — Strachan added: 'When we've played we've believed we can play football. Tonight it was a more physical duel. Charlie Mulgrew (centre) celebrates the victory as Scotland move up to third in Group D. 'We dealt with that as well because the players trust each other. 'They know fine well if they're not having a great night the guy next to him will help them out. 'And I think that's what happened tonight.' Asked what his over-riding emotions were ahead of an England friendly at the same venue, Strachan said: 'There are lot of emotions chucked in there, every emotion possible. But the good thing is I can go home, get to my bed and chill. That's what I'll do, go home and watch a bit of telly and fall asleep. I'm looking forward to that.'

Please briefly summarize this news article: The FTC is getting a new chief technologist: Carnegie Mellon’s Lorrie Cranor The Federal Trade Commission is one of the government's major online privacy watchdogs. And it's getting a new chief technologist: Carnegie Mellon University professor Lorrie Cranor, who will step into the role in January. “Technology is playing an ever more important role in consumers’ lives, whether through mobile devices, personal fitness trackers, or the increasing array of Internet-connected devices we find in homes and elsewhere,” FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said Thursday in a press release announcing the shift. “[Cranor] will play a key role in helping guide the many areas of FTC work involving new technologies and platforms.\\" Cranor teaches computer science and engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon, where she serves as the director of the university's CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory. She's also on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and previously worked at AT&T Labs Research. In an email statement, Cranor said she looks forward \\"to participating in the great work the agency has done in the areas of consumer privacy and data security.\\" She will replace Ashkan Soltani, who has served as chief technologist since November 2014. Soltani was a privacy practitioner who worked with The Washington Post to parse technical details of surveillance programs revealed by documents from Edward Snowden. That's different from the academics who previously held the job. \\"I was definitely an anomaly,\\" Soltani said, but added that his background was helpful because it gave \\"the agency insight into what the industry is doing.\\" Cranor will return the job to academic hands, a tradition started with the agency's first chief technologist, Princeton professor Ed Felten, who now serves as a deputy U.S. chief technology officer at the White House. The flexibility of academics to take sabbaticals so they can work for the government is likely a factor in that trend -- and one that has led to short terms when those academics return to their old posts. Cranor will be the fifth person in the job since Felten first took it up in 2011, and no one has lasted two years. In fact, Soltani's 14-month stint was on the longer side of the spectrum for the job. \\"There's not a lot of people who would be qualified for, and would take, this role,\\" Soltani said. Cranor, he added, is a \\"big score\\" for the agency. It's unclear what Soltani's own next steps will be, but the agency expanded its technical capacity during his time in its top tech spot. In March, it launched a new office dedicated to technology research and investigations. That same month, it also took steps to secure visitor's connections to its web sites. But the FTC also lost some privacy enforcement ground to the Federal Communications Commission this year when a regulatory shift put the network activities of Internet Service Providers outside of its grasp. The two agencies are trying to work together on consumer privacy issues as the FCC is beefing up its own technology staff.

At first I was going to say giving them daily chores, but the “reward” part of that has actually not been realized yet (what with all the eye rolling and such). So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on. But when I look at that worn oak (outdated) table, that needs refinishing in the worst way - I am grateful for the evenings there, where my kiddos learned to be a family.

Black and white images that can be colored in by your child are also great.","completion":"Once you have gathered the images, gather your materials, including various colored pencils, markers, or paints for your child to express their creativity while coloring in the images, as well as sturdy cardstock, scissors, a hole puncher, clear fishing line or string, a circular or rectangular wooden dowel or ring (preferably between 12-18 inches in length or diameter, depending on the size of your mobile), and some fun Halloween-themed decorations such as fake spiderwebs, plastic spiders, or even decorative orange and black ribbon. Begin by deciding on the layout and arrangement of the images on your Halloween mobile – this can range from a simple cascading design to a more complex multi-tiered arrangement. Once the layout has been finalized, print or trace the chosen images onto the cardstock, ensuring they are an appropriate size to fit the desired design, and cut them out carefully with scissors or a craft knife. Next, let your child color in the images using their preferred coloring method, taking care to encourage their artistic flair and imagination in bringing the Halloween characters to life. Allow the colored images to dry if necessary, and then use the hole puncher to create small holes at the top of each image, making sure they are evenly spaced and centered to ensure proper balance in the mobile. Cut strings or fishing line to various lengths, bearing in mind the design of the mobile and creating a visually appealing staggered effect. Attach the strings to the images by threading them through the punched holes and securing them with a simple knot or even a small dab of glue to ensure they remain in place. Now it is time to assemble the mobile's structure. To do this, take the wooden dowel or ring and attach the Halloween decorations to it, creating a festive and eye-catching base. Next, tie the other end of the strings with the images to the dowel or ring, ensuring they are spaced out evenly and maintaining the desired layout. If using a dowel, you may need to attach additional support strings on either end, forming a \\"V\\" shape to hang your mobile. If using a ring, simply add a string at the top and gather the ends to create a single hanging point. Once your mobile is assembled, find a suitable location to display your unique Halloween creation, ensuring it is high enough to avoid accidental bumps and tugs from enthusiastic trick-or-treaters. Hanging your mobile near a window or light source will provide the best effect, as it will cast intriguing and playful shadows around the room as it rotates gently. Take pride in your artistic collaboration with your child and enjoy the whimsical touch of spooky charm this Halloween mobile brings to your home during the festive season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What was offered to the city of Reykjavík as a gift? from the following article ? The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything.

These vocalizations are specifically designed for echolocation and are usually in a frequency range that is optimal for the bat to detect, often being ultrasonic, meaning they are above the range of human hearing. Before the sound travels in waves, the bat generates these calls or clicks that act as the source of the sound waves it will eventually use to locate objects in its environment. These vocalizations are produced at regular intervals or sometimes in rapid succession, allowing the bat to gather continuous or near-continuous information about its surroundings. The frequency, intensity, and duration of these calls may vary depending on the species of bat and the specific situation it is in, such as foraging, navigating, or socializing. Once the bat has produced these echolocation calls, the rest of the process, as described in the original list, can begin. The emitted sound will travel in waves, bounce off objects, and return to the bat as echoes. Through specialized adaptations in their ears and brain, bats are then able to interpret these echoes to determine information about their environment, such as distance, size, shape, and texture of those objects. This allows bats to skillfully navigate and find food sources even in complete darkness. Other animals, such as dolphins and some species of birds, also use echolocation in generally similar ways to navigate and hunt for prey in their respective environments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He won't play in a neighborhood where government minders are lurking and watching. He won't have to praise and thank the president before giving a book report. He won't fear talking about politics, afraid that he'll say something the regime doesn't like. \\"My son represents the new Tunisia,\\" Ben Salah, a Tunisian native, recently told CNN. \\"I will tell him what I had to do and what I grew up with and he'll understand that now there is no fear. Fear left with Ben Ali. May he and that fear never come back.\\" A year ago, the 28-year-old posted an iReport about what it was like to grow up in Tunisia under former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. As she wrote, Tunisia was in the throws of a historic revolution, a movement that would spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa. The movement, known as the Arab Spring, was born in Tunisia with a street vendor's self-immolation last year on December 17. Mohamed Bouazizi was reportedly pushed to such extraordinary ends after a municipal official and her aides were alleged to have harassed and humiliated him, and confiscated his goods. Tunisians viewed Bouazizi's act to be the ultimate protest against corruption in Ben Ali's government that they blamed for high unemployment and a lack of speech and political freedom. Throngs of Tunisians took to the streets demanding the ouster of Ben Ali who became president in 1987. Following the 28-day Tunisian revolt that toppled Ben Ali, revolt spread in other countries: Egypt and the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. The civil war in Libya and death of Moammar Gadhafi. Continued protests in countries such as Yemen and Bahrain. And a series of bloody demonstrations in Syria. WHO'S GONE AND WHO'S HOLDING ONTO POWER? \\"To know that the Arab Spring started in Tunisia is just something that warms my heart. It fills me with a love of my country that I thought I would not feel because it was so hard there for many years,\\" Salah says. \\"I am so glad that tyrant is gone.\\" Ben Ali resigned and fled to Saudi Arabia in middle January 2011. A Tunisian military court in late November sentenced him in absentia to five years in prison for his role in a 1991 case in which 17 servicemen were accused of plotting a coup against his regime, the state-run Tunisian News Agency reported. Salah will travel to Tunisia with her baby in late December to celebrate. Salah has been pursuing a doctorate in mechanical engineering in California, and wasn't in Tunisia for the protests. But she communicated frequently on the phone and over Skype with her parents during the demonstrations. Her family lives in the same town where she was raised, in Le Kram, a 15-minute drive from the presidential palace near Tunis, the capital. She recalled to CNN this week the thrilling phone and Skype conversations she had with her family when the protests were happening. \\"The first conversation with my family -- we talked for so long because we were so excited,\\" she recalls. \\"We were just shouting, a lot of relatives jumping in to say something. It was odd because there were curfews in Le Kram and Tunis, and my parents were telling me that the neighbors were protecting their houses because the police weren't working. But no one was stealing or hurting each other.\\" Salah's father would occasionally interrupt during the calls, afraid that their conversations were being monitored by the government. \\"He would say, 'Let's not talk. Maybe this is dangerous. We shouldn't,'\\" she remembers. \\"And yes, it was scary a little but we were all too excited. It was joy, relief, no fear at all.\\" Salah said her friends and family say that when Ben Ali was ousted, change occurred almost immediately. They were small and slow changes in the way people lived, but they were deeply meaningful. \\"My family would say that they heard people talking in the streets and before you just didn't talk to anyone because you didn't want to be overheard saying something against Ben Ali,\\" she says. \\"Now you can go to a coffee shop and hear people for the first time talking politics. They just talk and talk politics even if they don't understand it because they are so excited to have this freedom.\\" Salah's own family enjoyed these new political freedoms. During the October election in Tunisia, she supported one party while her parents supported another and they often talked openly about their different opinions. In December, Tunisia's new president, Moncef Marzouki, was sworn in. The veteran human rights activist, who had been imprisoned during Ben Ali's regime, was elected by an Islamist-dominated parliament, the Constituent Assembly. \\"For people in the West, they may not understand what a big deal that is,\\" Salah says. \\"Tunisians understand it and that's what really matters.

Reindeer to be culled in Russia’s far north due to anthrax outbreak A governor in Russia’s far north has said the reindeer population will be reduced by 100,000 after an anthrax outbreak, but scientists have said twice as many need to be culled. Reindeer herding is an important industry and livelihood for indigenous peoples in the Yamal-Nenets region. Its governor, Dmitry Kobylkin, told state news agency RIA Novosti that about 100,000 reindeer would be culled this winter because overpopulation was straining a limited food supply and increasing the risk of anthrax infection. An outbreak in Yamal-Nenets – the first since 1941 – killed a 12-year-old boy and more than 2,500 reindeer in July and August. Scientists and officials blamed the awakening of the “zombie infection” on abnormally hot temperatures caused by global climate change. Thawing of the permafrost soil can release the frozen bacteria. “For [lack of fodder], some herder families take their animals to graze in restricted areas where there’s a high risk of Siberian plague infection,” Kobylkin said, using the Russian name for anthrax, a bacterial infection often transmitted through contaminated food or water. Regional authorities will buy the reindeer to be culled and process the meat, he said. Officials have said reindeer meat exports could increase from 300 tonnes last year to 800 tonnes this year. More than 750,000 reindeer live in the Yamal-Nenets region, even though the region’s pasture land can support only 386,000 reindeer without degrading, Vladimir Bogdanov, director of the Urals Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta. At least 200,000 reindeer need to be culled, he said. Reindeer overpopulation compounds the anthrax risk. Over-grazing reduces the plant cover, which serves as a buffer to protect the permafrost from thawing in the summer sun. In addition, reindeer grazing where plant cover is thin tend to eat soil along with lichen, becoming infected that way, Bogdanov said. “If steps aren’t taken, there will be a mass die-off in the near future,” he said. “The animals won’t hold out against lack of fodder and various diseases.” But reducing the reindeer population is a thorny political issue, since that is how many indigenous people earn a living. Following Kobylkin’s remarks, reindeer herder Yeiko Serotetto started a petition to president Vladimir Putin calling for the reindeer population to be preserved. He argued that there would be no risk of anthrax infection if the government hadn’t stopped vaccinating reindeer against the disease in 2007, and said the cull was “motivated by the interests of the gas drilling industry”. Oil and gas exploration in the far north has led to increasing conflicts with indigenous peoples in recent years. Kobylkin said regional authorities are “working on the issue of job placement for the local population” after the planned cull.

Scientists argue that at least 200,000 reindeer need to be culled to mitigate the risks. The overpopulation leads to overgrazing, which reduces plant cover. This, in turn, affects permafrost thawing, which can release frozen bacteria. The culling plan is a controversial issue due to its impact on the livelihood of indigenous peoples who rely on reindeer herding.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years was it between when the Danish claimed St. John to when the population of African slaves on St. John was more than five times larger than that of the Euopean inhabitants?","completion":"Title: The Emergence of St. John's Enslaved African Population Introduction St. John, a picturesque island in the United States Virgin Islands, has a rich history imbued with European colonialism and the forced migration of Africans. Understanding the population dynamics of the island requires delving into the tumultuous past that shaped this Caribbean paradise. This article explores the timeline of Danish colonization of St. John and the subsequent point at which the African slave population exceeded five times that of European inhabitants on the island. Step 1: Establish the timeline for Danish colonization The Danish West India Company first claimed the island of St. John on March 25, 1718. This initiation marked the beginning of Danish rule, which was aimed at establishing a continuous Danish presence in the Caribbean, capitalizing on the highly profitable sugar cultivation trade. Denmark's colonization of St. John inevitably resulted in the large-scale importation of enslaved Africans to work on the burgeoning sugar plantations. Step 2: Analyze the evolution of the population dynamics Population statistics from the Danish period illustrate the increasing number of Africans forcibly brought to St. John. As sugar plantations expanded rapidly, so did the demand for labor. In 1721, there were approximately 28 European inhabitants and 216 African slaves on the island. This ratio reflects the early stages of the plantation system, as it indicates that the African slave population was almost eight times larger than the number of European settlers. The African slave population continued to grow throughout the 18th century. By 1733, the number of enslaved Africans had reached around 1,087, while the number of European inhabitants remained relatively stable at around 208. Step 3: Determine the point where the African slave population exceeded five times that of European inhabitants To determine the point at which the African slave population exceeded five times that of the Europeans, we need to perform a simple calculation. Let's denote the number of European inhabitants as E, and the number of African slaves as A. We aim to find the lowest number of years, Y, after 1718 that satisfies the inequality A > 5E. Considering the population statistics from 1721, just three years after Danish colonization, the African slave population was already nearly eight times larger than the European population. Given the numbers mentioned earlier (28 European inhabitants and 216 African slaves), the inequality A > 5E is satisfied, as 216 > 5 * 28. Conclusion In conclusion, the African slave population on St. John exceeded five times that of European inhabitants just three years after Denmark claimed the island in 1718. This distressing transformation speaks volumes about the exploitative nature of European colonialism and the atrocities endured by enslaved Africans throughout history. The legacy of this dark period in St. John's history lives on through the descendants of those who survived, and it is essential to remember and honor their resilience and courage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It now houses the reception area for the Training and Event Centre. The first floor of the building was used as training rooms for Cub Scout Leaders. The clock on the front of the building was a gift from a former Japanese Chief Scout, Count Sano, who was present at an early training course at Gilwell Park. The weather vane on the roof depicts Dick Turpin, who was rumoured to live on the site. Close to the estate entrance, The Lodge was built in 1934 as the Camp Chief's (later succeeded by the Director of Programme and Development) home. The building is now used to accommodate Scout Association staff and host internal meetings. The Gilwell Farm is the oldest building on the site still standing, dating from the 1600s. The building started as two separate cottages. In the grounds of the building is the last remaining well on site, known as Gil Well. The Farm was refurbished from its derelict site, opening in 2015 as the new offices and reception of Scout Adventures Gilwell Park . Close by, The Leopard Gates mark the original entrance to Gilwell Park, and were carved by Gilwlel master craftsman Don Potter in 1928.

Tom read more about the brains of mammals, while Reed learned more about the brains of amphibians. Which student learned less about a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum? Hint: The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum. This layer is called the neocortex (the pink region of the brains in Figure above ). The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal.","completion":"To determine which student learned less about the unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum (the neocortex), let's examine what each student studied: 1. Tom studied the brains of mammals. - According to the hint, all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum, called the neocortex. So, Tom must have learned about the neocortex while studying mammal brains. 2. Reed studied the brains of amphibians. - Since the hint only mentions that the neocortex is present in mammals, there is no indication that amphibians have a neocortex. Hence, Reed would not have learned about the neocortex while studying amphibian brains.

Although Satsunan literally means the south of Satsuma Province, the north-eastern group of the Ōsumi Islands formed Tane Province for a brief period in the 8th and 9th centuries and then were merged into Ōsumi Province. The Tokara Islands and the northwestern group of the Ōsumi Islands belonged to Kawanabe District of Satsuma Province. The Amami Islands paid tribute to the Ryukyu Kingdom to the South until they were put under direct control in the late 16th century, but were conquered in 1609 by the Satsuma Domain. In 1879, the Amami Islands became Ōshima District of Kagoshima Prefecture. The Tokara Islands and the north-western group of the Ōsumi Islands were transferred to Ōshima District in 1897, and then to Kagoshima District in 1973. After World War II, the Tokara and Amami Islands were put under United States military occupation, which formed the Government of the Northern Ryukyus. The Japanese government fiercely contested the Amami Islands being affiliated with the word \\"Ryukyu\\", believing that it would lead to a later return of the islands to their control.

Born in Brooklyn, Graziano later moved to an Italian enclave centered on East 10th Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A in Manhattan's East Village. He grew up as a street fighter and learned to look after himself before he could read or write. Context: Graziano heard from a couple of his friends about a tournament going on with a gold medal for the winner. He entered under the name of Joe Giuliani and was trained by Tobias (Toby) Zaccaria of Kings County (Brooklyn), NY. He fought four matches and ended up winning the New York Metropolitan Amateur Athletic Union Boxing Competition (1939). He sold the gold medal for 15 and decided that boxing was a good way to make cash. A couple of weeks into amateur fighting, Graziano was picked up for stealing from a school. He went to Coxsackie Correctional Facility, where he spent three weeks, with boyhood friend Jake LaMotta, and then he went on to the New York City Reformatory where he spent five months. After he got out of the reformatory, he headed back to the gym to earn money and while there, met Eddie Cocco who started his professional career. He entered the ring under the name Robert Barber. A couple of weeks later, Graziano was charged with a probation violation and sent back to reform school where he was charged with starting a minor riot. He was then sent to Rikers Island. When Graziano got out of jail he enlisted in the military but went AWOL after punching a captain. He escaped from Fort Dix in New Jersey and started his real boxing career under the name of \\"Rocky Graziano\\". He won his first couple of bouts. After gaining popularity under the name of Graziano, he was found by the military. After his fourth bout, he was called into manager's office to speak with a couple of military personnel. Expecting to be prosecuted and sent back to the military or jail, he fled. He returned to the military a week later. He turned himself in, but he was pardoned and given the opportunity to fight under the army's aegis. Question: How did his amateur career begin? Answer:","completion":"Graziano's amateur career began when he heard about a tournament with a gold medal for the winner.

Given the question: The answer to the question: Which organization does Sir John Hamilton's servant betray? is inside the article: County Cork, Ireland, 1920. Dr. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practise medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views. Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind.

Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2 \\"Mr. Hastings has better uses for his talents.\\" This sentence implies that there are more suitable or effective ways for Mr. Hastings to utilize his talents.

The album was Slayer's ninth studio recording, and was released on August 8, 2006. During reviews \\"Jihad\\" received a mixed reception. Blabbermouth's Don Kaye gave the opinion that \\"a handful of songs\\" on Christ Illusion \\"are either too generic or the arrangements are too clumsy to work well\\", and specifically singled out the track: \\"I'm looking at you, 'Jihad' and 'Skeleton Christ'.\\" Ben Ratliff of New York Times remarked that the song is \\"predictably tough stuff, but let's put it on a scale. It is tougher, and less reasoned, than Martin Amis's recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda.\\" Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as: ..the same sort of detached, matter-of-fact tactic Hanneman and Araya have employed for \\"difficult\\" subjects in the past—Josef Mengele's Nazi atrocities in \\"Angel of Death\\" or Jeffrey Dahmer/Ed Gein's ghoulish proclivities in \\"213\\" and \\"Dead Skin Mask\\"—with great effect.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Doctors studied Dan, a normal patient, whit a normal number of red blood cells, and Jim, a patient that had sickle-cell anemia. The differences were remarkable in terms of overall well-being and health. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which patient had more red blood cells, Dan or Jim? Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.","completion":"Based on the given information, it is stated that Dan is a normal patient with a normal number of red blood cells, while Jim is a patient with sickle-cell anemia. Although the question appears to ask about the quantity of red blood cells, it is crucial to understand the difference in the quality of these cells before answering the question. The primary role of red blood cells, as mentioned, is to transport oxygen throughout the body using the protein hemoglobin. The sickle-cell anemia develops due to a certain mutation in the gene responsible for creating hemoglobin. This mutation leads to an altered structure of the protein, causing the hemoglobin to clump together. Consequently, the red blood cells also become distorted and take on a crescent (sickle) shape. Now, addressing the question of which patient has more red blood cells, it is important to note that the total number of red blood cells may not necessarily be significantly different between Dan, who is a normal patient, and Jim, who has sickle-cell anemia. However, the efficiency and functionality of these cells are highly different between the two patients. While Dan has a normal hemoglobin structure that effectively carries and transports oxygen, Jim's altered hemoglobin structure leads to a diminished ability to carry and transport oxygen throughout the body. Additionally, the sickle-shaped cells in Jim's blood are more prone to breaking down, which can cause anemia—a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells. Although it could be possible that Jim might have lower red blood cells due to anemia as a consequence of sickle-cell anemia, it is essential to emphasize the primary difference between Dan and Jim lies in the quality and functionality of the red blood cells and not necessarily the quantity. To definitively determine which patient has more red blood cells, a direct laboratory measurement of their red blood cell count would be required. However, based on the context provided, it can be inferred that Dan has a normal number of healthy red blood cells, while Jim possesses sickle-shaped cells, which could very likely lead to a lower number of cells due to anemia resulting from his sickle-cell condition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Retail therapy has long been considered as a good way to let off stress. Now, US scientists have discovered not only does retail therapy exist,but that it could be caused by an individual's fear of sudden death. Researchers found materialistic people thought terrorism and war more stressful than others. Psychologists believe the rise of materialism around the world and its treatment effect on extreme stress might be a response to fear of death caused by acts of terrorism, disease and natural disasters. The scientists from Michigan State University said people with possession obsessions often have lower self-esteem than others so are more likely to shop as the result of severe psychological suffering. Ayalla Ruvio,a business professor studying people's shopping habits while rockets fell in Israel, said, \\"When the going gets tough, the materialistic people go shopping. This stress spending is likely to produce even greater stress and lower well-being. Essentially, materialism appears to make bad events even worse. Dr Ruvio led a two-part study of Israeli citizens living in a town that came under extreme rocket attacks for about six months in 2007. She compared 139 residents of the southern town with 170 from another town that was not under attack to see how their symptoms of post-traumatic stress and shopping habits varied. Dr Ruvio found that, when faced with a deadly threat, those who are highly materialistic suffered much higher levels of stress,while their tendency to shop was increased. Dr Ruvio said, \\"The relationship between materialism and stress may be more harmful than commonly thought.\\" The second stage of their research surveyed 855 Americans about their materialistic nature and fear of death. They found shopping was used to relieve feelings of stress and anxiety about death but this was in response to fear of a variety of life-threatening events like car accidents, criminal attacks and natural disasters. Answer:","completion":"Question: According to the article, what could be causing retail therapy in materialistic people? A. The excitement of finding new and unique items B.

A general love for shopping and spending money Answer: B.

Frank Baum, the author of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and various other novels, lived in several places during his life. Born on May 15, 1856, in Chittenango, New York, Baum spent his early years in the town and its surrounding area. His father, Benjamin Ward Baum, was a successful businessman who owned a barrel factory and later ventured into other businesses, including oil drilling. In his childhood, Baum's family moved to a large estate called \\"Rose Lawn\\" in Mattydale, New York, where he spent many of his formative years. In 1880, Baum moved to South Dakota to join his brother Charles, who had established a homestead under the Free Land Act. He started a business in Aberdeen, a newspaper named The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer, where he served as an editor and publisher from 1888 until 1891. However, due to the inadequacy of the business, Baum turned to theater and writing, which eventually led him to move to Chicago, Illinois, in 1891. The family moved to Humboldt Park, a residential area located on the west side of the city. While in Chicago, Baum worked as a newspaper reporter and continued honing his writing skills, producing various works of fiction and non-fiction. In 1900, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was published, marking the start of his success as an author. Baum's rising fame and increasing financial stability enabled him to buy an estate in Macatawa, Michigan, in 1900. He affectionately named the yellow house \\"The Sign of the Goose\\" due to its unique design, which resembled a goose's head. The family spent their summers at the estate, where Baum wrote several of his Oz books. In 1910, due to health reasons, Baum moved with his family to Hollywood, California, just as the burgeoning film industry began to take shape. He lived in a residence called \\"Ozcot\\" at 1749 North Cherokee Avenue, designing the house and garden with an Oz-inspired theme. It was in Hollywood where Baum continued to produce successful Oz books and founded his own movie production company, The Oz Film Manufacturing Company. L.

By Harriet Arkell PUBLISHED: 03:49 EST, 13 May 2013 | UPDATED: 05:02 EST, 13 May 2013 A row has broken out between academics at two Oxford University colleges after a professor said a planned student accommodation block would spoil the views from his rooms. Jonathan Bate, provost of Worcester College and world-renowned Shakespeare expert, has complained that Exeter College's building would be 'overbearing, out of scale and out of character', and would 'obliterate' views from his rooms. However the Rector of Exeter College, Frances Cairncross, has hit back at Professor Bate, saying the accommodation is desperately needed for less well-off students and adding: 'We do not feel that colleges should go out of their way to deprive undergraduates of affordable accommodation.' 'Any further reduction will mean the loss of 14 student rooms – and that means 14 of our students each year will have to rent on the very expensive private market in Oxford instead of having subsidised Exeter College accommodation.' This disagreement highlights the constant struggle to balance the need for affordable student housing and maintaining the historic character of prestigious colleges like those found at Oxford University. While Professor Bate's concerns regarding the aesthetics of the new building are understandable, considering the rich history and architectural beauty of the university, Rector Cairncross argues that the needs of the students should not be overshadowed by the desire to preserve certain views. In reality, the conflict between preserving historic sites and accommodating the growing demand for affordable student living extends far beyond Oxford University. Universities, colleges, and city councils across the globe are grappling with the challenge of providing adequate, affordable housing while still preserving the integrity and character of their institutions and local communities. In their efforts to address this issue, several universities have adopted various strategies such as offering financial aid packages that include housing subsidies, partnering with local developers to create affordable housing units off-campus, or converting existing buildings into student residences while maintaining their historical appearance. In the case of Exeter College, a feasible solution might lie in finding a compromise that addresses both the concerns of Professor Bate and the needs of the students. Dialogue between the two parties should be encouraged, with the possibility of gathering feedback from the broader university community, including students, faculty, and alumni, which would help establish a consensus on the best course of action. Whichever path is chosen, it is crucial that universities and colleges prioritize both the well-being of their students and the preservation of their invaluable historical legacies. Only through careful collaboration and consideration of all factors involved can these institutions maintain the delicate balancing act between progress and preservation."},{"prompt":"Question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Available choices: (i) yes (ii) it is not possible to tell (iii) no","completion":"(iii) No The hypothesis \\"The Palacio de Cristal had to be demolished recently\\" is not true based on the given premise. As per the premise, the Palacio de Cristal, a 19th-century iron and glass solarium, has recently been reopened after years of renovations. This implies that the structure has undergone restoration and refurbishment to maintain its historical and architectural integrity, instead of being demolished. The renovations likely involved various activities to preserve the original design, materials, and construction techniques of the iron and glass structure. These activities could include repairing or replacing damaged or deteriorated components, addressing structural issues, and implementing measures to protect against future damage. Furthermore, the Palacio de Cristal serves as a venue for temporary art exhibitions, indicating that the building is still functional and meets the necessary safety standards. The hypothesis stating that the Palacio de Cristal had to be demolished is therefore not accurate, as the given premise clearly indicates that the building has been preserved, restored, and reopened for public use.

Answer a question about this article: The late Georgian period saw the birth of the semi-detached house, planned systematically, as a suburban compromise between the terraced houses of the city and the detached \\"villas\\" further out, where land was cheaper. There had been occasional examples in town centres going back to medieval times. Most early suburban examples are large, and in what are now the outer fringes of Central London, but were then in areas being built up for the first time. Blackheath, Chalk Farm and St John's Wood are among the areas contesting being the original home of the semi. Sir John Summerson gave primacy to the Eyre Estate of St John's Wood. A plan for this exists dated 1794, where \\"the whole development consists of pairs of semi-detached houses, So far as I know, this is the first recorded scheme of the kind\\". In fact the French Wars put an end to this scheme, but when the development was finally built it retained the semi-detached form, \\"a revolution of striking significance and far-reaching effect\\". What put an end to the scheme of semi-detached houses?","completion":"The scheme of semi-detached houses in the Eyre Estate of St John's Wood, which was initially planned in 1794, was put on hold due to the French Wars. The French Wars, a series of military conflicts between France and various European powers that lasted from 1792 to 1802 and later from 1803 to 1815, disrupted the development of this housing plan. Economic instability and resources being diverted to support the war efforts likely contributed to this delay. However, when the development was eventually built after the wars, it retained the semi-detached house format, representing a significant and influential change in housing design at that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - The IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version and progenitor of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform. It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida. - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS. - The expansion card (also expansion board, adapter card or accessory card) in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. - Columbia Data Products (CDP) is a company that produced some of the first IBM PC clones. It faltered in that market after only a few years, and later reinvented itself as a software development company. - Clean room design (also known as the Chinese wall technique) is the method of copying a design by reverse engineering and then recreating it without infringing any of the copyrights associated with the original design. Clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions. - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s. - The BIOS (an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is a type of firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup) on IBM PC compatible computers, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware is built into personal computers (PCs), and it is the first software they run when powered on. The name itself originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems and the interface of that original system serves as a \\"de facto\\" standard. - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Compaq Computer Corporation was a company founded in 1982 that developed , sold , and supported computers and related products and services . Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers , being the first company to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer . It rose to become the largest supplier of PC systems during the 1990s before being overtaken by HP in 2001 . Struggling in the aftermath of the dot - com bubble bust , Compaq was acquired for US 25 billion by HP in 2002 . The Compaq brand remained in use by HP for lower - end systems until 2013 when , without warning , the Compaq name was quietly discontinued . The company was formed by Rod Canion , Jim Harris and Bill Murto -- former Texas Instruments senior managers . Murto ( SVP of Sales ) departed Compaq in 1987 , while Canion ( President and CEO ) and Harris ( SVP of Engineering ) left under a shakeup in 1991 , which saw Eckhard Pfeiffer appointed President and CEO . Pfeiffer served through the 1990s . Ben Rosen provided the venture capital financing for the fledgling company and served as chairman of the board for 18 years from 1983 until September 28 , 2000 , when he retired and was succeeded by Michael Capellas , who served as the last Chairman and CEO until its merger with HP. Prior to its takeover the company was headquartered in a facility in northwest unincorporated Harris County , Texas , that now continues as HP 's largest United States facility . What is the relationship between 'compaq' and 'information technology'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between 'Compaq' and 'information technology' lies in Compaq's role as a significant player in the development and popularization of personal computers (PCs) in the information technology sector. Compaq Computer Corporation was founded in 1982 and became a major producer of IBM PC-compatible computers, being the first company to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer. Compaq's contributions to the industry not only helped establish PC standards and compatibility but also influenced the landscape of information technology during the 1990s. At its peak, Compaq became the largest supplier of PC systems in the 1990s, a testament to its impact on the information technology market. As a pioneer in the development and sale of personal computers and related products and services, Compaq was an active participant in shaping the evolution and maturity of the IT industry throughout the late 20th century. The company's success and influence are evident in the wide adoption of PC-compatible devices, which facilitated the growth and dissemination of information technology, enabling millions of users to access and engage with digital content. Furthermore, the company's involvement with the Internet and the World Wide Web also highlights its relationship with information technology. The rapid growth of the Internet sector and related fields during the dot-com bubble, which took place from roughly 1995 to 2001, was closely tied to the widespread accessibility of personal computers. As a significant supplier of these PCs, Compaq played an essential role in making information technology more accessible to a broader population, thus fostering innovation and communication within the global digital ecosystem. Although Compaq was ultimately acquired by HP in 2002 and the brand was eventually phased out in 2013, its legacy within the information technology industry remains. The company's success in creating IBM PC-compatible devices and catering to an expanding market for personal computers has solidified its place as an influential player in the development and popularization of information technology during the late 20th century. Through its products and services, Compaq contributed to the growth and adoption of computing technologies that now form the foundation for many aspects of modern life and business."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He answers the door and she loses her nerve. Instead, she pretends to be a maid offering a free day of cleaning as a marketing tool for Maid'n Haven (a New Haven based maid service). John, who has nearly dropped out of his Yale music faculty position and is now living in a depressed and dirty stupor, agrees to Rhoda's offer. When she finishes, John, who still does not know she is the person who killed his wife and son, asks her to come back next week.

Here is an article: An ancient Mayan calendar claims that Burgarach, France (pictured), is the only place on Earth that will be saved from the apocalypse on December 21. (CNN) -- When the Mayan \\"Long Count\\" calendar ends on Friday, December 21, some people predict it could mark the end of the world as we know it. But despite the attention that December 21 is garnering, many apocalyptic believers don't actually give much thought to the hype surrounding the Mayan calendar. Some doomsday believers pinpointed 2012 as a pretty good year for disastrous solar flares, giant asteroids or global pole shifts that could likewise signal the apocalypse. Other theories that may or may not happen this year involve the Rapture, the catastrophic collapse of civilization or even a zombie uprising. There is diversity among apocalyptic \\"prepper\\" groups, and to paint them all with a broad stroke of the crazy brush is to ignore the nuances in what these various groups believe. John Hall, author of \\"Apocalypse: From Antiquity to the Empire of Modernity,\\" said groups organized around 2012 end-of-world predictions -- driven by pseudoscientific or numerological predictions -- are \\"more fanciful\\" than some other doomsday believers. That's because they look toward dramatic external events, as opposed to others that approach theories with a \\"fair amount of scientific basis,\\" such as the disappearance of natural resources. Read more: The apocalypse, by the numbers Although Hall and his colleagues have spent years trying to define or connect them, the groups can be as hard to explain as their disparate beliefs. \\"It's not like a pie of apocalyptic stories that can be divided up so much as it is a story where people coming from many different places can ... express the urgency of the crisis they foresee,\\" Hall said. For instance, Hall said the survivalists -- both those of the fundamentalist religious persuasion and the nonreligious -- are looking to opt out of post-apocalyptic strife. That analysis applies to Dan Martin, a survivalist living off the grid and author of \\"Apocalypse: How to Survive a Global Crisis,\\" a book that teaches skills for living a self-sufficient life after what he perceives to be an oncoming collapse of civilization and governments. He said his readers are \\"normal middle-class\\" soccer moms and teachers who read about world events and \\"connect the dots.\\" \\"Most of my readers aren't die-hard, end-of-the-world subscribers or enthusiasts,\\" he said. \\"They don't want things to change, but aren't ignorant to the fact that they most likely will within our own lifetime, so preparing for such a strong possibility isn't desperation or ignorance or naivety, it's just another insurance policy.\\" Insofar as civilization's collapse is something we're bringing upon ourselves with a little help from world powers, Martin and his readers might relate to radical environmentalists or peak oil environmentalists, who subscribe to the theory that there is a date when petroleum production will max out and decline rapidly. Debunking doomsday: 6 rumors dispelled Hall sees a connection between the survivalists and religious rapturists who \\"look at themselves as missing out on the agonies of the apocalypse because they're going someplace else.\\" Jerry Jenkins, co-author of the \\"Left Behind\\" book series about the Rapture within the Christian Bible's end-of-days Book of Revelation, doesn't completely agree with Hall's assessment. He said the media has incorrectly portrayed his readers as triumphalists who boast \\"We're going, you're not, too bad for you.\\" The whole point of the \\"Left Behind\\" books, Jenkins said, was to encourage people to read the Revelation prophecies because religious rapturists want all people to have a better life in heaven. \\"[We're not] saying 'good' people go and 'bad' people are left behind,\\" said Jenkins, who believes the key to being raptured (or taken into heaven before the Apocalypse happens on Earth) is to receive Jesus Christ. But Jenkins added that even those \\"looking forward to being rescued\\" are still dedicated to improving life for everyone on terra firma before they go. Interestingly, Jenkins said Christ himself said he didn't even know the day or hour of the Rapture, so the ilk of Christian radio broadcaster Harold Camping who attempt to predict its timing are \\"crazies\\" engaged in folly that \\"make us all look like idiots.\\" Camping claimed he was able to use the Bible to calculate the exact date of the Rapture (most recently it was supposed to be May 23, 2011, and before that in 1994). Those who point to science instead of Biblical lore to predict the end of the world are another apocalyptic subculture, according to Hall. These groups are comprised of theoretical physicists and futurologists -- such as Michio Kaku -- whom Hall calls \\"optimistic utopian prophets.\\" These people believe in the Technological Singularity theory: The possibility that technologically augmented intelligence will change human life as we know it or possibly wipe it out completely. There's even a think tank of sorts formed around this logic. The Singularity Institute is comprised of scientists, philosophers and philanthropists from places such as the Research Triangle and Silicon Valley, and universities such as Oxford, Harvard and Stanford, said Michael Anissimov, media director at The Singularity Institute. Their goal? Constructing a smarter-than-human intelligence that has the values of humanity. Instead of avoiding the growth of artificial intelligence, the Singularity Institute is trying to manage the risk. If peak oil theorists believe we're rapidly running out of a major resource, the institute postulates that technology itself is advancing so rapidly that society will have an overabundance of it -- and an artificial intelligence is set to emerge that will not necessarily pursue mankind's best interests. \\"We do think it's possible, if not probable, that it could actually lead to either the marginalization or end of humanity,\\" said Anissimov. Doomsday dining: Your last meal Whereas religious and scientific apocalyptic subcultures converge and diverge on various points, there is one end-of-world scenario that manages to reflect all their anxieties: the zombie apocalypse. The zombocalypse of popular culture has become something of a Rorschach test of apocalyptic fears. Depending on the point of view, zombies may result from an act of God, the irresponsible use of science, an environmental disaster, a cosmic event and so forth. Scott Kenemore, author of \\"The Zen of Zombie\\" and a member of the advisory board of the Zombie Research Society, said the zombie apocalypse can represent a validation of sorts for people awaiting their particular extinction event.

Article: See more of Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook ||||| In the hope of avoiding future foreign meddling in elections, as was seen in 2016 US presidential campaign, Facebook announced today (April 6) some of its most significant efforts to date to boost transparency in political advertising. The moves come before CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before US lawmakers next week over a different scandal. In October, Facebook said it would require advertisers running electoral ads to verify their identity and location. It will now extend that requirement to so-called “issue ads,” which aim to sway opinions on immigration, gun rights, the economy and other topics. Crucially, the company said it would now also verify the identity of administrators of pages with large followings, making it harder to run them from fake accounts. Facebook pages were used by Russian agents to spread misinformation during the 2016 election, according to the US Justice Department. “These steps by themselves won’t stop all people trying to game the system,” Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on his personal Facebook page. “But they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads.” Each electoral and issue ad will be labeled as “political” and will include information on who paid for it, which would be required by the Honest Ads Act, transparency legislation that has been introduced in Congress, a bill Facebook appears to be pre-empting with its new policies. Zuckerberg reiterated his support for the legislation in his post, although as Quartz has reported, the company has lobbied against it. Facebook also said that a feature it has been testing in Canada, which allows users to see all the ads run by a given page in a separate tab—an experiment that critics have called insufficient and misleading—will be rolled out widely in June. At the same time, Facebook also plans to offer a repository of all political ads along with information on the ads’ audience and money spent on it. “In order to require verification for all of these pages and advertisers, we will hire thousands of more people. We’re committed to getting this done in time for the critical months before the 2018 elections,” Zuckerberg said in the post. In the company’s announcement, VPs Rob Goldman and Alex Himel encouraged users to report malicious ads as they see them. Facebook has in the past brought in thousands of workers to moderate content and attempt to mitigate fake news on its platform. All of these moves are sure to make Zuckerberg’s testimony in Congress on April 11 just a tad easier, allowing him to point to the company’s specific moves to fix the problems it has caused. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO — For months, Facebook’s critics — ranging from Silicon Valley executives to Washington politicians — have been urging the company to do a better job of identifying who is buying political ads and creating pages about hot-button topics on its social media sites. On Friday, just days before its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, is expected to testify before Congress, Facebook said it had started forcing people who want to buy political or “issue” ads to reveal their identities and verify where they are. Mr. Zuckerberg announced the move in a post on Facebook. He said this verification was meant to prevent foreign interference in elections, like the ads and posts from so-called Russian trolls before and after the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Zuckerberg added that he supported a Senate bill, the Honest Ads Act, that would bring political advertising on the internet more in line with what is required on broadcast television. One of the sponsors of the bill, which has some bipartisan support but is still in the committee stage, said that statement was a reversal from what Facebook had earlier indicated. |||||Summary:","completion":"Facebook is making changes to be more careful with political ads and pages. They want to make sure people know who is behind these ads and pages, and if they are real or just trying to cause trouble. This is because some people from other countries, like Russia, have been pretending to be someone else and making fake ads and pages on Facebook during important elections. Facebook's boss, Mark Zuckerberg, says these changes won't stop everyone from causing trouble, but they will make it harder for them to do so.

Here is an email: Here is the Commission's basic policy on reverse open seasons. I've asked Randy Rich to look into the other aspects of your questions, which we'll discuss shortly. The Commission has a two-step process for determining whether the market finds an expansion project economically viable. The first step, which occurs prior to the certificate application, is for the pipeline to conduct an open season in which existing customers are given an opportunity to permanently relinquish their capacity. This first step ensures that a pipeline will not expand capacity if the demand for that capacity can be filled by existing shippers relinquishing their capacity. The second step is that the expansion shippers must be willing to purchase capacity at a rate that pays the full costs of the project, without subsidy from existing shippers through rolled-in pricing. The reverse open season requirement (i.e., the requirement that a pipeline give customers the opportunity to turn back capacity) is established Commission policy. It was stated in the Commission's Pricing Policy for New and Existing Facilities Constructed by Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines, 71 FERC P61,241 at p. 61,917 (1995), reh'g denied, 75 FERC P61,105, and later reiterated in Certification on New interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities (Certificate Policy Statement), 88 FERC P61,227 (1999), order clarifying statement of policy, 90 FERC P61,128, order further clarifying statement of policy, 92 FERC P61,094 (2000). My research has indicated that the Commission has provided few specifics on how a reverse open season is to be conducted. This probably allows pipelines considerable discretion in how they conduct their solicitations of turnback. General Commission policy would probably require only that shippers be given adequate notice of and opportunity to respond to the reverse open season. If the procedure used by El Paso for soliciting turnback becomes an issue, please let me know and let's discuss it. I'll be up in a few minutes for our call to Randy.

Given the question: What is the last name of the man who carved the chimneypiece in the house with the Hondecoeter room? Answer the above question based on the context below: The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\".

Richmond, Virginia After the American Revolutionary War, Richmond emerged as an important industrial center. To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, George Washington helped design the James River and Kanawha Canal in the 18th century to bypass Richmond's rapids, with the intent of providing a water route across the Appalachians to the Kanawha River. The legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag. As a result of this and ample access to hydropower due to the falls, Richmond became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities in the country, including iron works and flour mills, the largest facilities of their kind in the South. The resistance to the slave trade was growing by the mid-nineteenth century; in one famous case in 1848, Henry \\"Box\\" Brown made history by having himself nailed into a small box and shipped from Richmond to abolitionists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, escaping slavery.

First question: When I sing, am I supposed to feel vibrations in my face? Second question: Why is my voice changing and I am not able to sing? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, I will address the first question: \\"When I sing, am I supposed to feel vibrations in my face?\\" Step 1: Consider the context of singing and how it produces sound. When you sing, your vocal cords vibrate to produce sound. This vibration is transferred through the air and can be felt in various parts of the body, depending on the frequency and intensity of the sound. Step 2: Identify the relevance of facial vibrations. Feeling vibrations in the face is quite common when singing, particularly in the areas around the nose, lips, and cheeks. These vibrations are more noticeable for certain styles of singing and specific notes or tones. Step 3: Conclude the response. Yes, it is normal to feel vibrations in your face when singing, as the vibrations from your vocal cords travel through the air and are felt in different parts of the body. Next, I will address the second question: \\"Why is my voice changing and I am not able to sing?\\" Step 1: Identify possible factors that influence voice changes. Several factors can cause voice changes, such as age, hormonal fluctuations, throat or vocal cord problems, illness, and even stress or fatigue. Step 2: Provide examples of factors. - If you are going through puberty, your voice may be changing because of hormonal fluctuations. - If you have recently been sick, your vocal cords could be temporarily affected. - Overuse or straining your voice can cause temporary or permanent damage in extreme cases. Step 3: Offer recommendation. It would be helpful to consult a vocal coach or medical professional if you are concerned about your voice changing and not being able to sing. Finally, I will address whether these two questions are asking the same thing: Step 1: Assess the focal points of each question. - The first question is regarding the sensation of facial vibrations while singing. - The second question is concerning changes in the user's voice and their ability to sing. Step 2: Identify similarities and differences between the questions. - Both questions revolve around the act of singing and vocal sensations. - However, they address different aspects: one focuses on physical sensations in the face, while the other focuses on vocal changes and ability to sing. Step 3: Conclude whether the questions are the same. Although both questions are related to singing, they are not asking the same thing. The first question is about whether it is normal to feel facial vibrations while singing, while the second question is about why the user's voice is changing and they are not able to sing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

( 1976 ) is a documentary film shot in the IMAX format . It follows the history of flight , from the first hot air balloons in the 19th century to 20th century manned space missions . It was created for performance at the National Air and Space Museum 's IMAX Theater in Washington , D.C. - Film stock is an analog medium that is used for recording motion pictures or animation. It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum. - The National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, also called the NASM, is a museum in Washington, D.C.. It holds the largest collection of historic aircraft and spacecraft in the world. It was established in 1946 as the National Air Museum and opened its main building on the National Mall near L'Enfant Plaza in 1976. In 2014, the museum saw approximately 6.7 million visitors, making it the fifth most visited museum in the world. The museum contains the Apollo 11 module, the Friendship 7 which was flown by John Glenn, the Bell X-1 which broke the sound barrier, and the Wright brothers plane near the entrance. - The National Mall is a national park in downtown Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. The National Park Service (NPS) administers the National Mall, which is part of its National Mall and Memorial Parks unit. The term \\"National Mall\\" commonly includes areas that are officially part of West Potomac Park and Constitution Gardens to the west, and often is taken to refer to the entire area between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol, with the Washington Monument dividing the area slightly west of its midpoint. A smaller designation, sometimes referred to as the \\"Mall proper\\", excludes both the Capitol grounds and the Washington Monument grounds, applying only to an area between them. The National Mall contains a number of museums and memorials and receives approximately 24 million visitors each year. - The Bell X-1 was a rocket engine-powered aircraft, designated originally as the XS-1, and was a joint National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics-U.S. Army Air Forces-U.S. Air Force supersonic research project built by Bell Aircraft. Conceived during 1944 and designed and built in 1945, it achieved a speed of nearly in 1948. A derivative of this same design, the Bell X-1A, having greater fuel capacity and hence longer rocket burning time, exceeded in 1954. The X-1, piloted by Chuck Yeager, was the first manned airplane to exceed the speed of sound in level flight and was the first of the X-planes, a series of American experimental rocket planes (and non-rocket planes) designated for testing of new technologies and often kept secret. - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. - Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two humans, who were Americans, on the Moon. Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the lunar module \\"Eagle\\" on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module \\"Columbia\\" alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rendezvousing with \\"Columbia\\" in lunar orbit. - L'Enfant Plaza is a complex of four commercial buildings grouped around a large plaza in the Southwest section of Washington, D.C.. Immediately below the plaza and the buildings is the \\"La Promenade\\" shopping mall. The plaza is located south of Independence Avenue SW between 12th and 9th Streets SW (9th Street actually runs underneath the centers of the buildings on the easternmost side of the plaza). It was built perpendicular to L'Enfant Promenade, a north-south running street and pedestrian esplanade part of which is directly above 10th Street SW. The plaza is named for Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, the architect and planner who first designed a street layout for the capital city. It was dedicated in 1968 after completion of the north and south buildings. - Roman Kroitor (December 12, 1926 September 17, 2012) was a Canadian filmmaker who was known as an early practitioner of Cinéma vérité, as co-founder of IMAX, and as creator of the Sandde hand-drawn stereoscopic animation system.

They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft on December 17, 1903, four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 190405 the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft. Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible. - IMAX (an acronym for Image maximum) is a motion picture film format and a set of cinema projection standards developed in Canada by Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor, Robert Kerr, and William C.

See options at the end The walk in the gym was more comfortable than the walk in the woods because it was hotter in the OPTIONS: (a). woods .. (b). gym ..","completion":"The sentence ends with option (a). The complete sentence is: \\"The walk in the gym was more comfortable than the walk in the woods because it was hotter in the woods.\\" This sentence suggests that the individual found the walk in the gym to be a more pleasant experience in comparison to the walk in the woods, due to the higher temperature in the woods. The choice of the gym over the woods in this context highlights the speaker's preference for a cooler environment during physical activities. The gym likely had a controlled climate, such as air conditioning, while the woods were exposed to the outdoor elements, which may have been characterized by hot and humid weather on that particular day. Walking and engaging in other forms of physical activity within a controlled environment like a gym offers certain advantages over doing the same activities outdoors. In the context of this sentence, the climate-controlled nature of the gym provides an ideal setting for the speaker to avoid the challenges and discomfort associated with walking in hotter conditions in the woods. These challenges might include excessive sweating, potential dehydration, and overheating, which can result in symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. Furthermore, walking in the gym can often provide additional benefits, such as a flat and even surface, which minimizes the risk of tripping or slipping. On the other hand, walking in the woods may involve navigating uneven terrain, rocks, tree roots, and other obstacles. Although many people do enjoy the natural beauty of the outdoors while engaging in physical activities, the speaker in this situation is highlighting their preference for more comfortable conditions that directly impact their ability to walk in an enjoyable and safe manner. In conclusion, the sentence illustrates the speaker's preference for walking indoors in a cooler, climate-controlled gym environment rather than outdoors in the hot woods. Besides the controlled temperature, other factors that might have contributed to their choice include safer walking conditions and a more predictable environment. While engaging in physical activities outdoors can certainly offer its own set of benefits, the speaker's decision shows the importance they place on their personal comfort while engaging in physical activities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Make an appointment to see your doctor within 1-2 weeks if you're showing basic signs of anemia like fatigue.","completion":"They can perform diagnostic tests, which usually involve taking a blood sample, to accurately measure your iron levels and determine if you are indeed suffering from an iron deficiency. Upon receiving your test results, your doctor can advise you on appropriate treatment options or discuss potential preventative measures based on the underlying cause of your low iron levels. Some common causes of low iron levels include poor dietary intake, decreased iron absorption due to gastrointestinal issues, or chronic blood loss. Pregnant women, children, and people with certain medical conditions are also at increased risk for developing an iron deficiency. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods like red meat, poultry, fish, legumes, and fortified cereals. If your doctor confirms that your iron levels are low, they may recommend iron supplements or dietary changes to help increase your iron intake. Be sure to follow their advice, as taking too much iron can be harmful. Additionally, your doctor may suggest consuming foods rich in vitamin C, as it can enhance iron absorption in your body. Regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider are crucial for monitoring your iron levels and making adjustments to your treatment plan as necessary. Do not hesitate to communicate any symptoms or concerns during your follow-up appointments, as this information can help your doctor optimize your care and address any complications that may arise. In summary, checking and maintaining healthy iron levels is vital for your overall well-being. If you suspect your iron levels are low, promptly schedule an appointment with your doctor, who can provide an accurate diagnosis and guide you on the proper course of treatment.

Star Trek Beyond Will Feature Gay Hikaru Sulu When it premiered on NBC in 1966, Star Trek was revolutionary in its diversity. Featuring a Japanese-American helmsman (George Takei) and a female African-American communications officer (Nichelle Nichols) among its core characters, the show presented a multicultural vision of the future that was unprecedented in network television. But just as progressive as actually making the show diverse was its nonchalance about this vision, presented without scandal or fanfare. To the disappointment of many fans, the show’s inclusion did not extend to LGBT characters, even as it blossomed into a major franchise over half a century. That fact is set to change with the release of Star Trek Beyond on July 22, in which it has been revealed that Hikaru Sulu, played by Takei in the original series and by John Cho in the most recent big-screen trilogy, will be gay. Cho says the decision to reveal the sexual orientation of the character, who has never had any explicit romantic attachments (though his daughter was introduced in the 1994 film Star Trek Generations), was made by writer Simon Pegg and director Justin Lin. It is meant, in part, as a tribute to Takei, who came out as gay in 2005 and has since become an advocate for LGBT rights. In a way, revealing Sulu to be gay in Beyond is a continuation of the franchise’s treatment of diversity as a non-issue. As Cho told the Herald Sun, “I liked the approach, which was not to make a big thing out it, which is where I hope we are going as a species, to not politicise one’s personal orientations.” For many, the news is simultaneously welcome and alarmingly late, especially given the show’s progressive track record. The show was among the first to depict an interracial kiss, in the 1968 episode “Plato’s Stepchildren,” a decision which sparked a backlash, Takei has said, that made creator Gene Roddenberry fear that too much envelope-pushing could backfire and leave him without a show at all. This fear contributed to the lack of LGBT representation during Roddenberry’s tenure, though he had apparently been planning to add an LGBT character to Star Trek: The Next Generation before he died suddenly in 1991. It’s also possible that the idea that the series’ universe transcends race and sexuality may have created a situation in which addressing the issue felt unnecessary to its helmers. Roddenberry’s son Rod told Wired in 2013, though he conceded that it sounded a bit like a cop-out, “I mean, there were interspecies relationships on Star Trek, so we’re just beyond the point where homosexuality is an issue.” But as Devon Maloney wrote in that story, a thorough look at the franchise’s record with regard to LGBT representation, “The invisibility of gay characters isn’t neutral; it’s negative.” At a time when only 36 percent of studio movies pass the Vito Russo Test—a litmus test for whether LGBT characters are not only represented but presented as complex people rather than thin stereotypes—visibility is critical. The question now is not only how Sulu’s sexual orientation will play out in Star Trek Beyond, but whether this decision might also bode well for LGBT representation in the reboot of the Star Trek show airing on CBS All Access next year and produced by Rod Roddenberry. The treatment of sexuality in the series’ character development may well be a non-issue—as important as Sulu’s love for botany or fencing or his daughter—but the visibility of rich LGBT characters is an issue, and one worth monitoring closely. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the character Hikaru Sulu from Star Trek Beyond, who will be gay in the upcoming film set to release on July 22. This change in the character's representation comes as an effort to be more inclusive of the LGBTQ community within the Star Trek franchise. The article discusses the history of the franchise's treatment of diversity, its importance in bringing visibility to LGBTQ characters, and how the upcoming film may impact future character development in the series."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? They denied reports according to the statement","completion":"From the provided paragraph, we can infer that the statement \\"They denied reports according to the statement\\" is true. The paragraph clearly states that the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front's (FMLN) urban commandos have rejected or denied the reports claiming their participation in an attack on the home of Vice President-elect Francisco Merino. Furthermore, the information from the paragraph would suggest that FMLN's urban commandos wanted to distance their organization from any involvement in the alleged attack on the elected official's residence. This denial could come in the form of an official statement or a spokesperson for the group expressing their disapproval of such actions, which would be in line with the statement in question. Though the paragraph does not directly confirm the source of the statement (whether it is an official communique or verbal rebuttal from a spokesperson, for instance), it does emphasize that the FMLN's urban commandos have effectively denied any involvement in the mentioned attack. It is important to consider the context and reliability of the denial in terms of the sources providing this information.

Physically, clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, and can enhance safety during hazardous activities such as hiking and cooking. It protects the wearer from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions. Further, they can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from harmful UV radiation. There is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed, but some information has been inferred by studying lice. The body louse specifically lives in clothing, and diverge from head lice about 107,000 years ago, suggesting that clothing existed at that time. Another theory is that modern humans are the only survivors of several species of primates who may have worn clothes and that clothing may have been used as long ago as 650 thousand years ago. Other louse-based estimates put the introduction of clothing at around 42,000–72,000 BP.

Clothing serves multiple purposes for humans. It primarily offers protection, insulation, and a hygiene barrier, shielding the body from various elements in the environment, materials, and conditions. 2. Clothing protects the body from elements like the sun, rain, wind, and snow. 3. It safeguards the skin from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns, and prickles, and can enhance safety during hazardous activities such as hiking and cooking. 4. In addition to protection, clothing also provides insulation against hot and cold conditions. This helps regulate the body's temperature and maintain comfort. 5. Clothing acts as a physical barrier between the skin and the environment. It is made of various materials like fabrics, fibers, and synthetics that create a shield from harm and maintain insulation. 6. Other mammals don't usually wear clothing; however, humans have developed pet clothing for additional protection, warmth, or fashion. Still, unlike humans, other mammals rely on their fur, feathers, or skin to protect them from different conditions. 7. It is challenging to determine the exact timeline of when humans started wearing clothes. Estimates based on studying lice propose that clothing may have been used between 42,000 to 107,000 years ago. 8. Research on lice, specifically the body louse, gives us insights into when clothing might have been first used. The body louse lives in clothing and is believed to have diverged from head lice around 107,000 years ago. This suggests that clothing likely existed at that time. 9. As mentioned earlier, louse-based estimates indicate that clothing existed between 42,000 and 107,000 years ago. The study of the evolution of lice and the divergence of body lice from head lice helps establish a timeline for the existence of clothing. 10.

Would \\"The Dutch economy was hit considerably by the ongoing global financial crisis and the ensuing European debt crisis .\\" be a reasonable answer? (1). No; (2). Yes; The answer is:","completion":"(2). Yes; The Dutch economy was indeed hit considerably by the ongoing global financial crisis and the ensuing European debt crisis, but this only gives a snapshot of the effects during that specific period. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the economics of the Netherlands, it is essential to consider the broader characteristics of its economy, as well as its performance in recent years. The Dutch economy is the 17th largest in the world in terms of GDP and is known for its stable and prosperous nature. It is a developed and highly diverse economy, with a strong focus on international trade, advanced technology, and a skilled workforce. In fact, the nation is one of the most competitive economies in the world, largely attributed to its advantageous geographic location and well-developed infrastructure. One of the most distinctive features of the Dutch economy is its reliance on international trade. Benefiting from its coastal location and advanced port facilities, particularly the Port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands is one of the world's leading exporters and importers of goods and services. Major export goods include machinery, electronics, chemicals, fuels, food, and pharmaceutical products, while imports mainly consist of raw materials, consumer goods, and services. The key trading partners are Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and China. The Dutch economy is also characterized by a highly developed service sector, which constitutes around 70% of the GDP. Major industries within this sector include financial services, logistics, and tourism. Notably, many international companies choose to establish their European headquarters in the Netherlands due to the favorable tax and business environment. Moreover, the Dutch agricultural sector is highly productive and advanced. Despite the country's relatively small size, it is the world's second-largest agricultural exporter, after the United States. This can be attributed to advanced agricultural technology and a focus on high-value-added products such as fresh produce, dairy, meat, and flowers. The Dutch labor market is marked by its flexibility and high level of workforce participation. With a relatively low unemployment rate, the Netherlands prides itself on a well-qualified workforce, both in terms of education and skills development. Furthermore, the Dutch government plays an essential role in shaping the economy through its well-crafted fiscal policies, targeted spending, and efforts to create a conducive business environment. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the European debt crisis, the Dutch economy experienced a period of relatively slow growth and increased national debt. However, with the help of prudent fiscal policies, structural reforms, and a steady focus on fostering competitiveness and innovation, the country managed to recover in the subsequent years. Pre-pandemic data show the Dutch economy witnessing stable growth, with low unemployment and manageable fiscal balances. In summary, the statement that the Dutch economy was hit considerably by the ongoing global financial crisis and the ensuing European debt crisis is accurate. However, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the economics of the Netherlands, it is important to consider its fundamental attributes like its international trade orientation, developed service sector, advanced agricultural output, well-qualified workforce, and the government's role in shaping the economy."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

East Rutherford is approximately 8 miles (13 kilometers) west of Midtown Manhattan in New York City, making it easily accessible to New York City's residents and visitors. Its proximity to the city is one of the reasons why these NFL teams chose MetLife Stadium as their home base, despite it being in a different state. MetLife Stadium was officially opened in 2010, and it was specifically designed to cater to the needs of both the New York Giants and the New York Jets, with the ability to accommodate their separate fan bases, colors, and branding elements.

Article: To be an effective online teacher, you should consider taking an online teaching course, in addition to ensuring you have taken a regular teacher training program and are certified to teach in your state or area. Teaching online can be very different than teaching in a classroom, as you do not have the advantage of face to face interaction with your students and it may be difficult to create a connection with students online. You can better prepare for the challenges of teaching online by taking a class or program on how to teach students in an online class. The university where you completed your bachelor’s degree may offer a class in online teaching or you may consider enrolling in a teaching online program through another university or college. It can be difficult to develop a sense of community and connection with other educators, especially if you are working from home and do not have to go into a school setting every day. It can also be hard to network and meet potential job contacts if you work from home and are not exposed to a professional environment on a daily basis. You can expand your contacts in education by joining an online teaching association in your area. Associations like The World Association for Online Education (WAOE) can connect you to other online teachers and refer you to potential employers. Some online teaching associations may also offer access to online forums where you can chat with other online educators on a daily basis, ask questions about teaching online, and get references for open positions at online teaching programs. The beauty of online teaching is you do not need to focus your job search in one geographical area or an area close to where you live, as you will be working from your home office throughout the day. Instead, you can search online teaching programs at online universities for open positions that are applicable to your content area speciality. You can also look at universities and colleges who offer online courses in subject matter that relates to your content area, as you can then apply to teach the specific online class. Make sure your CV and cover letter are customized to the positions you are applying for, as this will show the employer that you took the time to read and understand the skills required for the position. Customizing your resume and cover letter will also improve your chances of getting hired. If you are applying for a position teaching an online class in urban planning, for example, you may note on your resume that you have a bachelor’s degree in urban planning and have completed a practicum in a secondary level urban planning and design class as part of your bachelor’s degree. You may also want to include sample lesson plans as part of your job application to show that you can create effective lesson plans for a course. Make sure the lesson plans contain interactive activities and focus on keeping online students engaged in the online course. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about how to become a good online teacher.

Scarpia's apartment in the Palazzo Farnese, that evening Scarpia, at supper, sends a note to Tosca asking her to come to his apartment, anticipating that two of his goals will soon be fulfilled at once. His agent, Spoletta, arrives to report that Angelotti remains at large, but Cavaradossi has been arrested for questioning. He is brought in, and an interrogation ensues. As the painter steadfastly denies knowing anything about Angelotti's escape, Tosca's voice is heard singing a celebratory cantata elsewhere in the Palace. She enters the apartment in time to see Cavaradossi being escorted to an antechamber. All he has time to say is that she mustn't tell them anything. Scarpia then claims she can save her lover from indescribable pain if she reveals Angelotti's hiding place. She resists, but the sound of screams coming through the door eventually breaks her down, and she tells Scarpia to search the well in the garden of Cavaradossi's villa. Scarpia orders his torturers to cease, and the bloodied painter is dragged back in. He's devastated to discover that Tosca has betrayed his friend. Sciarrone, another agent, then enters with news: there was an upset on the battlefield at Marengo, and the French are marching on Rome. Cavaradossi, unable to contain himself, gloats to Scarpia that his rule of terror will soon be at an end. This is enough for the police to consider him guilty, and they haul him away to be shot. Scarpia, now alone with Tosca, proposes a bargain: if she gives herself to him, Cavaradossi will be freed. She is revolted, and repeatedly rejects his advances, but she hears the drums outside announcing an execution. As Scarpia awaits her decision, she prays, asking why God has abandoned her in her hour of need: \\"Vissi d'arte\\" (\\"I lived for art\\"). She tries to offer money, but Scarpia isn't interested in that kind of bribe: he wants Tosca herself.

It was a small coffee shop that cooked its own coffee beans. The coffee shop's business did well, and by 1981 there were three Starbucks stores in Seattle. Things really began to change for the company in 1981.That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who _ Starbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, which caused his great interest. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did.

Cardinal Richelieu, wanting to convince King Louis XIII that his wife, the queen, is unfaithful to him and in love with the Duke of Buckingham, suggests that he should ask his wife to wear the diamonds he had given her for an upcoming ball. The queen, shocked and dismayed, confesses to Constance that she had sent the diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham, and her confidant goes to d'Artagnan for help. With the help of his companions, three of the finest musketeers in France, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, d'Artagnan makes his way to England to seek the Duke himself, so that he may recover the diamonds and restore the queen's honor. Still, when all problems seem overcome, the English Duke of Buckingham plans to invade France, remove King Louis XIII and marry the queen; on the other hand, Cardinal Richelieu and Milady want revenge on d'Artagnan and Buckingham. Milady orders Rochefort to kidnap Constance Bonacieux, and when d'Artagnan learns this he sets off to rescue her. Milady is captured by Buckingham, and orders Felton to guard her. Felton falls in love with Milady; she seduces him and asks him to murder the Duke, which he does. Though she believes herself safe at a convent, Constance receives a visit from her supposed benefactor, Milady de Winter, who poisons her; d'Artagnan arrives at the scene and she dies in his arms. Together with Athos, Porthos and Aramis, d'Artagnan corners Milady and she is...

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"Ezekiel 33:27 - \\"You shall tell them, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him who is in the open field will I give to the animals to be devoured; and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.'\\" This verse is from the Book of Ezekiel, a prophetic book in the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. The passage cited is a translation of the original Hebrew text into English, with the specific formatting and style used to clearly identify the name of the Lord (Yahweh) and to convey the gravity of the words. In this verse, the Lord Yahweh is speaking through the prophet Ezekiel, communicating a message of judgment and punishment for the people who have turned away from Him and sinned. The verse emphasizes the severity of this divine retribution, detailing the various ways in which they will suffer and ultimately perish: by the sword, devoured by animals, or from pestilence (disease). The context of this verse is essential for understanding its meaning, as the Book of Ezekiel is centered on the themes of divine judgment, the fall of Jerusalem at the hands of Babylon, and the eventual restoration of the people of Israel. The entire book consists of revelations and prophecies given to Ezekiel by God, who shares these messages with the people in an attempt to lead them back to a path of righteousness. In summary, Ezekiel 33:27 is a pivotal verse showcasing the severity of divine judgment and consequences for those who disobey and turn away from the Lord Yahweh. By detailing the extreme suffering and death that will befall these individuals, the verse serves as a stark reminder of the importance of remaining faithful and obedient to God's will and commandments. In the corrected version, the capitalization of key words highlights the gravity of these prophecies and helps to communicate their significance to the reader."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Meanwhile, in a farm outside Washington, D.C., widowed farmer Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen) and his clumsy brother George (Simon Rex) discover a crop circle, saying \\"Attack Here!\\" (Signs).Meanwhile, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), now a blonde news reporter, announces the crop circles on the news. She then goes to pick up her paranormally endowed nephew Cody (Drew Mikuska) from school, where her best friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) is his teacher. George Logan arrives to pick up his niece Sue, who is in the same class. Cindy falls in love with George, who invites her and Brenda to a rap-battle that evening with his rapper friends Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart) (8 Mile). George competes and proves to be actually quite talented, but due to unintentional racist blunders, he's thrown out.Later, Brenda asks Cindy to keep her company, since she watched the cursed videotape. After playing several pranks on Cindy (fake seizures, burning hand, etc.), she gets the rest of the popcorn in the lounge, when the TV turns on. Brenda fails to turn it off. Tabitha (Marny Eng) climbs out of the well and the TV, Brenda gets into a fight with Tabitha. Tabitha ends up killing Brenda, since Cindy is ignoring the ruckus. George receives a phone call about the death, and Tom meets with Sayaman, who apologizes for the accident involving himself and Tom's wife Annie (Denise Richards).During Brenda's wake, George and Mahalik, due to a misunderstanding, wreak havoc on Brenda's corpse in an unsuccessful attempt to revive her, only to blow up her body and end up getting kicked out of the house. Later, Cindy decides to watch the tape, finding it odd. She then gets a phone call, saying she'll die in a week. She calls George, CJ and Mahalik for help.

When Cindy returns home, she finds Cody watched the tape.Back at work, Cindy searches through pictures of lighthouses before finding the one from the tape. Desperate to save Cody, Cindy tries to warn everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's teleprompter, but she is interrupted by her boss and a janitor who insults the manager on the teleprompter (which the anchorman blindly recites). The Logans hear the message and take it seriously since they encountered an alien disguised as Michael Jackson (Edward Moss), and President Baxter Harris (Leslie Nielsen), who personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles. Cindy ventures to the lighthouse, where she encounters The Architect (George Carlin). The loquacious (and lecherous) old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistook the evil tape for a copy of Pootie Tang and returned it to Blockbuster instead, unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race.Returning home, Cindy discovers her station has been broadcasting the evil tape for hours, and there have been various sightings of aliens around the world. Worse, Cody is missing. Cindy manages to track him back to the Logan farm, where he has taken refuge with George. Tom orders everybody into the basement for safety, as he, George and Mahalik go outside to fight off the extraterrestrials. The aliens (voiced by Tom Kenny) arrive but reveal they are friendly and have come to stop Tabitha, since they accidentally watched the tape on a broadcast they had intercepted, thinking it was Pootie Tang.In the basement, Cindy realizes the farm's cellar is what is seen on the tape and she finds the well where Tabitha was drowned under the cellar floor. Suddenly, Tabitha appears behind her. A short fight ensues, during which Tabitha takes Cody hostage. Cindy and George appeal to her, offering her a place in their family. Tabitha appears to accept the offer, but then changes back to her monstrous form and advances to Cindy and the others, only to be accidentally knocked back into the well by President Harris. The aliens leave in peace, and Cindy and George get married. Leaving for their honeymoon, they realize they forget to take Cody with them. At first, Cody is about to get hit by Cindy's car in an intersection, but she put the brakes this time to prevent it from happening, much to Cody's relief.

Which nuclear waste repository near Las Vegas Valley is represented by children's cartoon character Yucca Mountain Johnny? A:","completion":"A: Yucca Mountain Johnny is a children's cartoon character that represents the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, a proposed long-term storage facility for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, located near Las Vegas Valley in Nevada, United States. The creation of Yucca Mountain Johnny was an attempt to raise awareness and educate children about the importance of proper management and disposal of nuclear waste. The character is depicted as a friendly desert tortoise that lives in the Yucca Mountain area and is knowledgeable about nuclear waste storage. He often shares information with children and helps them understand the complexities associated with nuclear waste repositories and their significance. The Yucca Mountain repository has been a subject of debate and controversy for several years. The federal government and the U.S. Department of Energy initially selected the area in 1987 as the only site for consideration to store nuclear waste. However, concerns about potential environmental, health, and safety risks, as well as political disagreements and opposition from Nevada residents, have delayed the project. Critics argue that the facility could have adverse effects on the environment and local communities, especially considering its proximity to Las Vegas Valley. They point out the potential impact on groundwater, as well as the potential for accidents and natural disasters causing catastrophic leaks and releasing radioactive materials into the environment. Numerous legal challenges have also been filed over the years to either stop or delay the project. Supporters of the Yucca Mountain repository, on the other hand, emphasize the need for a safe and centralized long-term storage facility for nuclear waste. They argue that the lack of such a facility leads to temporary storing of high-level waste at nuclear plants across the country, potentially posing even greater risks to the environment and communities. They also claim that the facility's design incorporates cutting-edge technology and safety measures to protect the surroundings and comply with stringent regulatory requirements. In the context of Yucca Mountain Johnny, the character serves as an educational tool that simplifies a complex issue for a younger audience and provides an engaging way to teach children about nuclear waste and its responsible management. However, some may argue that anthropomorphizing such a contentious subject could downplay the seriousness of the risks associated with nuclear waste storage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For the few dollars I had in my wallet, I was able to buy a seven-inch black-and-white portable TV. I also bought a flashlight. The following weekend, at another yard sale, I saw a 14-inch color1 TV being sold for almost nothing. I felt I could not miss the offer and bought it. Now I had two sets and couldn't wait to see what else I could afford the next weekend. Spring ended, and by then I had accumulated almost every type of electronic equipment I had always wished to have back home. Then this new idea came to mind. I had heard about a man who traveled back home every few months. He drove a truck filled with boxes of new and used stuff that people were sending to s. So I told my father that I would send as many types of items as I could so that he could start his resale business. Every few months I would gather several boxes of American \\"junk\\" --- televisions, toasters, fans, hair dryers, etc. and send them home. As word got out about my father's \\"trash\\" market, people all came to buy these things. Three years later, when I visited my family for the first time since leaving home, I learned that many of the families in our neighborhood had a piece of \\"trash\\". It proved that I had the responsibility to keep people back home up to date with the latest technology you no longer need.(304words) Options: A the second TV set was bigger B the second TV set was color1 TV C the second TV set was very cheap D he wanted two TV sets very much Answer: C the second TV set was very cheap Question: A:","completion":"In the article, why did the author decide to buy the second TV set at a yard sale?

The given text has been transformed into lowercase, which is a common method for making the text appear more casual or less formal. Using lowercase letters can sometimes provide a more accessible or informal style for informal communication, like text messaging or social media posts. In this particular text, the message seems to convey the importance of faith in one's life and how turning back from that faith would be displeasing. By presenting this message in lowercase letters, it might appear more approachable or relatable to some readers, as they may relate to the more casual tone. However, it is essential to consider the context in which the text will be used, as some situations may call for more formal language. In formal writing, it is usually more appropriate to use capitalization and punctuation correctly to avoid conveying an unprofessional or less respectful tone. Despite the transformation in the case of the text, the meaning remains unchanged. The text still emphasizes the significance of being steadfast in one's faith and the consequences of giving up on that faith. This could serve as a reminder or a form of motivation for some individuals to remain committed to their beliefs, regardless of the challenges they might face. In summary, transforming the text to lowercase can lend a more casual or informal tone to the message, making it potentially more approachable for some readers. However, it is crucial to consider the context and the audience to ensure that the style is appropriate for the situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Steven regretted going camping with Ian because there were frogs all over the campsite, so","completion":"he decided to devise a plan to avoid them as much as possible. The first step in his plan was to conduct some research on the local frog species in order to better understand their habits and habitats. He pulled out his smartphone and searched for information about frogs in the area. This way, he thought, he could find out their active times and preferred locations, allowing him and Ian to adjust their camping activities accordingly. Once he'd gathered sufficient information, Steven shared his findings with Ian. They discovered that the frogs were most active at night and typically stayed close to the water's edge. With this knowledge, they decided to move their campsite further away from the water and would avoid walking near the shoreline during the evening hours. This would minimize their encounters with the frogs and make the camping experience more enjoyable for Steven. In addition to relocating their campsite, Steven and Ian also put into practice some preventive measures. They decided to use insect-repellent spray on their clothes and skin, as the frogs were attracted to insects lingering around the campsite. This would help to reduce the frog population near the campsite, since their food source would be diminished. Furthermore, they agreed to always wear shoes when walking around the campsite at night, in case they accidentally stepped on any frogs. This would protect both themselves and the frogs from potential harm. Lastly, they decided to make a small campfire each evening, as the light and heat would deter the frogs from coming too close to their campsite. By incorporating all these strategies, Steven felt more at ease about the situation and began to enjoy the camping trip with Ian. As the days went on, Steven started to develop a newfound appreciation for the frogs and their place in the ecosystem. Despite his initial fears and discomfort, he eventually gained a sense of respect for these creatures and understood the importance of coexisting with them in their natural habitat. Ultimately, though Steven's camping experience with Ian began with regret, it ended up being a valuable lesson in adaptability, understanding, and respect for nature. In time, Steven would even come to enthusiastically share this story with friends and family, recounting how his encounter with the frogs taught him to embrace and appreciate the diverse wildlife that inhabits our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This casual outfit made him feel comfortable and ready to face the challenges that lay ahead in the day. As he glanced down at his clean attire, he couldn't help but chuckle at the memory of the embarrassing fall he had taken earlier on the muddy path. Frank was heading to the city park for the annual Arts & Crafts Festival, a much-anticipated event in his small town. Local artisans and creatives came together to showcase their best work - from pottery and paintings to jewelry and homemade clothing. He was proud to be a part of this vibrant community and looked forward to supporting their crafts every year. He grabbed his wallet, phone, and a reusable tote, and set off for the park. The summer sun felt warm upon his skin, and there was a gentle, refreshing breeze that made the leaves in the trees rustle. As he walked, he could hear the excited chatter and laughter of other festival-goers in the near distance, further increasing his anticipation. Upon arriving at the park, Frank was greeted by a colorful array of tents and booths, each showcasing a unique piece of art or a sample of a craft. He took a leisurely stroll down the first row, pausing occasionally to examine some of the intricately-made pottery and wooden sculptures. As an amateur artist himself, he couldn't help but appreciate the handmade signs the vendors used to relay their names and the type of art they specialized in. A vibrant paisley scarf at one of the vendors caught Frank's eye. It reminded him of a similar scarf his mother used to wear when he was a child. Nostalgic feelings filled him, and he decided to buy the scarf to remind him of those simpler times. Furthermore, the vivid colors of the scarf just happened to match his capris. As Frank approached a booth filled with unique jewelry designs, a charming pair of earrings with various shades of blue caught his attention. They would make the perfect gift for his sister's upcoming birthday. As he paid for the earrings, he couldn't help but engage in a brief conversation with the artist, learning more about the stories and techniques behind her beautiful work. Frank's next stop was a tent filled with abstract paintings. The unconventional perspectives and the use of vibrant colors stirred up an immediate sense of awe within him. He couldn't resist the urge to purchase a smaller piece that complements his living room decor. As the day progressed, Frank continued to explore the festival, chatting with vendors and other art enthusiasts along the way. Every booth had a unique story, and he found great joy in learning the journey behind each artist's creations. He sampled homemade jams and relished a delicious lemonade made with fresh lemons, which he savored in the afternoon heat. Finally, in the evening, the sun began to set, casting an orange glow across the park filled with happy artisans and art lovers. With a sense of contentment, Frank realized that not only had he supported the local artists in his community, but he had also shared memories and forged new connections. His once-empty reusable tote was now filled with delightful treasures, each having a story to tell about his day at the Art & Crafts Festival. And although the day had started with a muddy mishap that resulted in donning a pair of capris, Frank couldn't help but feel grateful for the unexpected turn of events. For it was these capris and the day spent at the festival that had sparked a newfound love for the immense talent within his community, the beautiful diversity of art, and the many wonderful stories that connected them all."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For theories at the level of second-order arithmetic , the program for reverse mathematics has much to say .","completion":"These two statements appear to be similar but have different meanings due to the terms they use. Let's analyze each sentence more closely to understand their meanings and extact their differences. 1. For theories at the level of reverse-order arithmetic, the second mathematics program has much to say. This sentence is discussing \\"reverse-order arithmetic\\" and a \\"second mathematics program.\\" The main focus is on theories relating to reverse-order arithmetic, which seems to refer to a method of performing arithmetic operations in the opposite order than usual or to a particular set of mathematical rules or concepts. However, without additional context, it's unclear what precisely \\"reverse-order arithmetic\\" entails. The sentence states that a \\"second mathematics program,\\" potentially a different program or approach, has relevant insights or contributions to these theories. The focus here is on the interaction between this program and the concepts of reverse-order arithmetic. 2. For theories at the level of second-order arithmetic, the program for reverse mathematics has much to say. This sentence is discussing \\"second-order arithmetic\\" and a \\"program for reverse mathematics.\\" Here, the main focus is on theories that come into play at the level of second-order arithmetic. Second-order arithmetic is a formal system in mathematical logic which is a conservative extension of first-order arithmetic. It extends first-order arithmetic by allowing quantification over sets of natural numbers in addition to individual natural numbers. The program for \\"reverse mathematics\\" mentioned in the sentence is a research program that aims to determine the minimal set of axioms needed to prove particular theorems in mathematics. Reverse mathematics is an area within mathematical logic that seeks to understand the axiomatic foundations of mathematical theories by working backwards from the theorems to deduce the relevant axioms. In this sentence, the emphasis is on how the reverse mathematics program can contribute to the understanding or development of theories at the level of second-order arithmetic. In summary, the first sentence is about theories of reverse-order arithmetic and their relation to a second mathematics program, whereas the second sentence is about theories at the level of second-order arithmetic and their relation to a reverse mathematics program. Although both sentences discuss the intersections of mathematical theories and programs, they are focusing on different subjects and are therefore not equivalent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Spy: 8,000 hidden cameras like this one photograph the cars on Britain's roads 26 million times every day. Police are recording 26million images of motorists every day – an increase of 61 per cent since 2012, it emerged yesterday. Senior officers say the system is invaluable in preventing and solving serious crime and terror attacks. But civil liberty campaigners warn that it is intrusive and lacks oversight. The images are taken on a network of around 8,000 automatic numberplate recognition (ANPR) cameras across the UK. In 2012, 16million images were recorded every day by cameras – many of them unmarked – which are positioned on motorways and A and B roads. Each time a vehicle passes, a camera takes a picture of the vehicle’s numberplate and another of the front of the car, including the driver’s face. The cameras are operated by individual police forces but the records are stored on a national database of 17 billion images, used by police and intelligence services to track criminals. However, it also contains the records of innocent motorists, showing a detailed map of their daily journeys. Police refuse to reveal the locations of the cameras, saying to do so would undermine the effectiveness of the system. It is thought that by 2018, between 50 million and 75 million pictures of vehicles will be taken every day. The network of cameras is already so extensive that it allows police forces to track where vehicles have gone every single day. Pictures can be checked against the Police National Computer and used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in the battle against crime. The first cameras were installed in Britain on the M1 in 1984 to spot stolen vehicles. By 2005, the number of cameras had increased to 2,000 and there are now more than 8,000. As well as fixed cameras, police forces use mobile units - with more than 100 in London alone. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said the technology is being secretly rolled out without the public's knowledge. 'ANPR is a classic example of a very intrusive technology being rolled out with zero public debate. Tracked: The Government archive of 17 billion images works out as nearly 500 pictures of every one of the 36 million cars on Britain's roads. 'The public hasn't been given even the most basic information about what information is being recorded, how long it is kept or who is able to access it. 'When you consider the system allows every journey to be tracked, down to the second, and for someone to search through the entire log of when your car was scanned and where, it is without doubt an extremely intrusive system. 'How many people would have said yes if they had been asked to install a device on their car so the police could monitor their journeys? Yet this is exactly what ANPR technology allows. Secret camera: More Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras are expected to be rolled out over the next five years. 'It is a total failure of law and oversight if this massive yet secretive expansion of ANPR systems is legal.' Julian Blazeby, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: 'Given the nature of ANPR it is understandable that some will be concerned about how this data is used. 'ANPR has only ever been for the prevention and detection of crime as well as locating vulnerable people with the intent of preserving life. 'It has saved lives, brought serious, violent offenders to justice and is used in the detection of would-be terrorists. It’s not about tracking every vehicle’s journey – which is an exaggeration of ANPR’s capabilities. 'Currently we have an average of 7,750 active cameras within any seven day period and an average daily read of 26 million. 'However an increase to 50 or 75 million is not anticipated at this time and there are no current plans for a mass roll out of ANPR cameras. 'The database consists of approximately 17 billion records. This data is owned by the chief officers of law enforcement agencies who act as data controllers.' Police forces want to share the information harvested by the cameras with countries across Europe. A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'ANPR is a vital tool and we support its use where it is legitimate and proportionate. 'We have created a new, independent post of surveillance camera commissioner to help oversee this. 'These cameras may only be located where there is an identified need to detect, deter, and disrupt criminality. Any new ANPR camera deployment will also require a privacy impact assessment.'

Under 100 words is a good title length. Input: Background: Various kinds of commercial molecular systems have been developed for fast and more accurate detection of respiratory viruses. Anyplex TM II RV16 [RV16] was designed for simultaneous detection of 16 respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR coupled with TOCE TM technology. Objectives: To compare the performance of RV16 with those of culture and Seeplex ® RV15 ACE [RV15] by determining their sensitivity and specificity. Study design: Seven hundred and thirty respiratory samples were tested by modified shell vial culture method, RV16, and RV15. For molecular tests, automated nucleic acid extraction and liquid handling system using MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton, USA) was adopted to maximize the workflow and accuracy. Performance of each assay was determined against a composite reference standard. Results: Two hundred and one samples (28%) out of 730 samples were positive by culture, while additional 281 (39%) were positive by RV16 or RV15. Sensitivities of RV16, RV15, and culture for virus tested were as follows: 100/93/63% for influenza A, 90/80/69% for influenza B, 98/94/63% for RSV, 98/52/23% for adenovirus, and 100/75/46% for PIV. For viruses not covered by culture, sensitivities of RV16 and RV15 were as follows: 99/81% for rhinovirus, 92/100% for coronavirus OC43, 100/56% for coronavirus 229E/NL63, 92/88% for metapneumovirus, 100/62% for bocavirus, and 91/91% for enterovirus. Overall, the specificities of culture, RV16, and RV15 (Seegene) were 100/99.9/99.9%. Conclusions: RV16 assay was superior to culture method and RV15 and will be a promising tool for patient management and public health epidemiology.

Here's a short story: A snail and hummingbird both travelled a mile; did the (A) hummingbird take longer because it took more time to take the trip/ (B) snail. What is the most sensical answer between \\"hummingbird\\" and \\"snail\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"hummingbird\\" and \\"snail\\" is \\"snail.\\" To better understand this, let's discuss the characteristics of each creature and how they relate to their travel speeds. Snails are known for their slow movement, and they rely on their muscular foot to slowly slide across surfaces. The common garden snail, for instance, has an average speed of around 0.03 mph, which makes them one of the slowest moving creatures on Earth. When traveling a distance of one mile, a snail would take approximately 33 hours to complete the journey (assuming it could maintain a consistent pace and direction without stopping to rest, eat, or hide inside its shell). Hummingbirds, on the other hand, are among the fastest and most agile birds in the world, with some species capable of reaching speeds of up to 30 to 45 mph during their impressive aerial feats. A hummingbird's flight muscles make up about 30% of their body weight, which allows them to rapidly beat their wings to hover, fly forwards, backwards, and even upside down. When covering a one-mile distance, a hummingbird could complete the trip in around 1-2 minutes, provided that it is flying at a consistent speed and in a straight line. Considering the vastly different travel speeds of a snail and a hummingbird, it is clear that a snail would take much longer to travel a mile in comparison to a hummingbird. Both creatures exhibit their own unique adaptations that suit them for their respective habitats, but when it comes to speed and agility, a hummingbird has the clear advantage. Therefore, the most sensical answer to the question of which creature takes longer to travel a mile would be the snail, given its slow pace and limited mobility in comparison to the swift and agile hummingbird."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The school was across the street from our home and I would often watch the kids as they played during break. I remember the first day I saw her playing basketball. I watched in wonder as she ran circles around the other kids. She managed to shoot jump shots just over their heads and into the net. The boys always tried to stop her but no one could. I began to notice her at other times, basketball in hand, playing alone. One day I asked her why she practiced so much. Without a moment of hesitation she said, \\"I want to go to college. The only way I can go is to get a scholarship. I am going to play college basketball. I want to be the best. My Daddy told me if the dream is big enough, the facts don't count.\\" Well, I had to give it to her--she was determined. I watched her through those junior high years and into high school.

Write some highlights for the following article: Only one percentage points separates Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Joni Ernst in the race to represent Iowa in the U.S. Senate. If the election were held today, 49% of likely Iowa voters say they would vote for Braley and 48% say they would support Ernst, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. That means the contentious race is within the survey's overall sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The electorate is far from solidified. Twenty percent of likely voters polled in Iowa said they could change their mind before Election Day in November. The Braley-Ernst race has been one of the most closely watched of the election year. With longtime Sen. Tom Harkin retiring, Democrats are fighting to keep the seat in blue hands and hope that a win in Iowa will keep the Senate in Democratic control. Republicans have other ideas, however, and hope that Ernst -- currently a state senator and lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard -- will be able to flip the seat. With a little less than two months until Election Day, the race has already seen millions of dollars spent. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the two candidates had spent almost 6 million as of July. That figure doesn't include the millions that outside Republican and Democratic groups have spent on the race, either. Even with all the money spent, some likely voters are still unaware of each candidate. Six percent of likely Iowa voters are unfamiliar with Ernst, while 9% of voters say they are unfamiliar with Braley. Partisanship appears to trump identity politics in the race, too. Most women are supporting Braley, the Democratic man, while most men are supporting Ernst, the Republican woman. The two candidates are basically flipped with likely male and female voters: Braley is winning 41% of men and 57% of women, while Ernst is winning 56% of men and 41% of women. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted September 8-10, with 1,013 Iowa adults -- 608 likely voters -- questioned by telephone. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas? from the following article ? Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet (French: [ʒyl emil fʁedeʁik masnɛ]; 12 May 1842 – 13 August 1912) was a French composer of the Romantic era best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty. The two most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music. While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Pierné. By the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted... The answer is:","completion":"Massenet. The last name of the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas is Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet. He was a French composer of the Romantic era and is best known for his operas, such as Manon and Werther."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Choices: - bacteria - ribosomes - chromatids - dna A: A:","completion":"Double strands of DNA wrap around histone proteins to form nucleosomes, which are coiled into a chromatin fiber. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the genetic material responsible for storing and transmitting all the biological information needed to build and maintain living organisms. It is composed of two complementary strands that are coiled together to form a double helix. Each strand is made up of nucleotides, which include a phosphate group, a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), and one of four types of nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine). Histone proteins are small, positively charged proteins that play a crucial role in the packaging of DNA within the nucleus of the cell. They help manage and organize the long strands of DNA, so they fit within the confined nuclear space. There are five main types of histones: H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Together they form the core of the nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are the basic units of DNA packaging within the nucleus. Each nucleosome consists of a core particle, which is an octamer (eight units) of histone proteins, including two copies each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. About 147 base pairs of DNA wrap around this histone core, making around 1.7 turns. The H1 histone acts as a linker, binding to both the DNA and the core particle, and stabilizing the structure. The formed nucleosomes are subsequently organized into a linear array known as a beaded string, which is held together by linker DNA. This string is then wrapped and coiled into higher order structures, ultimately forming a chromatin fiber. Chromatin fibers are further coiled and condensed to form chromosomes during cell division. Chromatin fibers enable efficient packaging of DNA within the cell nucleus and the proper regulation of gene expression. By organizing DNA into these distinct, tightly packed units, cells can efficiently control which regions of DNA are accessible or inaccessible to the cellular machinery responsible for replication, transcription, and repair of DNA."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: You may think your bathroom is often full of bacteria and so you give it a complete cleaning once a week. But how often do you clean out and disinfect your fridge? Well, probably not often enough, according to a recent study, which found out that the fridge is the second dirtiest place in your house, just behind the bathroom. Fridge temperatures were often set too high, allowing the growth of bacteria, which included E.coil, Enterobacteria, and S. aureus, all of which will give you an easy access to food poisoning. So what can you do to ensure your fridge---and your food in it---is not a health threat? For starters, clean the fridge weekly---wipe it and repeat. Make sure your fridge is at the correct temperature for storing food, between 0 and 5 degrees centigrade. Your freezer should be below-18 degrees centigrade. You can use fridge and freezer thermeters to make sure this is the case. Some modern fridges have zones to store different types of food ,such as meat and vegetables. Make sure you don\`t store meat in the vegetable zone, as the temperature there might be higher. Make sure you don not leave the door open too long as the temperature in the fridge will quickly rise, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. Cover food that has not been finished, and eat it within a couple of days. Keep bottles and jars closed. Keep raw meat away from cooked meat. Both should be well covered to prevent pollution.

Context: Coming off their win over the Titans, the Broncos remained on home ground for an AFC West rematch with the San Diego Chargers on Thursday Night Football. A 15-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Andre Caldwell gave the Broncos the early lead. The Chargers subsequently got on the board, with a 38-yard field goal by placekicker Nick Novak. The Broncos answered, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Chargers would score 21 unanswered points and dominate the time of possession, as the Broncos' offense went three-and-out on all three of their second quarter possessions. A 19-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Philip Rivers to wide receiver Keenan Allen tied the game, and the Chargers grabbed the lead late in the first half, with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to Allen. The Chargers took the opening possession of the second half and increased their lead, culminating with running back Ryan Mathews rushing for a 23-yard touchdown. The Broncos were forced to punt after only four plays on their initial possession of the second half, and the Chargers' ball control offense subsequently ate up over eight minutes of the third quarter, though the Broncos' defense forced a Chargers' punt. The Broncos cut into the Chargers' lead in the fourth quarter, with a 5-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Caldwell with 10:30 remaining in the game. After forcing a Chargers' punt, the Broncos offense got the football with 5:50 remaining, however, three plays later, Manning was intercepted by Chargers' linebacker Thomas Keiser at the Broncos' 39-yard line. Six plays later, a 35-yard field goal by Novak increased the Chargers' lead to 27-17 with 2:41 remaining. With no timeouts remaining (save the two-minute warning), the Broncos tried to rally, with Prater kicking a 42-yard field goal with only 34 seconds remaining. However, the Broncos' onside kick attempt was unsuccessful, sealing the win for the Chargers.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Last week, the French government nationalised the STX France shipyard at Saint-Nazaire on the Atlantic coast to prevent a majority stake being taken by an Italian company. The French government said it was seeking to defend France's strategic interests by retaining a 50% stake. The French finance minister will resume talks on the deal in Rome on Tuesday. The shipyard is the only one in France big enough to build aircraft carriers, and it also builds other large warships and cruise ships. The world's biggest cruise ship, Harmony of the Seas, was built there. It was put up for sale after its biggest shareholder, the South Korean conglomerate STX, collapsed last year. The French government owned the remainder of the shares in the shipyard. Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri and another Italian investor subsequently reached an agreement to buy a majority stake in the shipyard. However, last week Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced that France had exercised a \\"pre-emption\\" right to buy back the stake from the Italians. He said the reason was to protect France's strategic interests in matters of naval construction. France proposed a 50-50 ownership deal with Italian state-owned Fincantieri, but the company rejected the idea. However, Mr Le Maire said the proposition, which would allow France's strategic interests to be preserved, remained on the table. He said he would travel to Rome on Tuesday to discuss it with Italian government ministers. In a statement, Mr Le Maire said the decision to nationalise the Saint-Nazaire shipyard was only temporary.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the representative of the 7th congressional district that includes the city that elected Jenny Durkan as mayor in 2017? ? Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant. For the first time in United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991. The majority of the city council is female.Federally, Seattle is split...

Article: Rap mogul Marion \\"Suge\\" Knight and comedian Micah \\"Katt\\" Williams were arrested Wednesday for stealing a paparazzo's camera outside a Beverly Hills studio last month, authorities said. Knight and Williams are charged with one count each of robbery. The two men are suspected of stealing the camera of independent celebrity photographer Leslie Redden on Sept. 5 outside a studio in Beverly Hills. Police say Knight \\"orchestrated\\" the robbery in an alley off North Canon Drive. \\"It was a strong arm robbery where a camera was forcefully removed from the photographer by Katt Williams. The victim in the matter did sustain injury in this case,\\" Beverly Hills Police Lt. Lincoln Hoshino said. Williams was arrested Wednesday morning after he arrived at an Inglewood court for arraignment in a separate assault case. Knight, who was staying at a property off the Las Vegas Strip, was taken into custody on Wednesday by a task force of local police and the FBI, according to a statement from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Las Vegas authorities made the arrest after they were advised by Beverly Hills police that a felony warrant for robbery had been issued for Knight. He was booked at the Clark County Detention Center on warrants for being fugitive and driving on a suspended license, Las Vegas police said. \\"Mr. Knight was unaware that there was any warrant,\\" said Richard Schonfeld, Knight's attorney. \\"We will be addressing the circumstances in court.\\" If convicted, Knight, who has a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, faces up to 30 years to life in state prison. Williams faces up to seven years in custody. \\"Mr. Knight is kind of a magnet for trouble over time. Assault with a deadly weapon in his past, he’s a fugitive from justice, driving on a suspended license,\\" NBC4 legal analyst Royal Oakes said. \\"As a result, if convicted of stealing a camera, he could go to prison for 30 years.\\" Oakes believes Knight and Williams' defense teams may also have a case. “I would say this is a horrible misunderstanding. These paparazzo folks can be abusive and you can’t blame him for lashing out and trying to take the camera,\\" Oakes said. Knight, the former head of Death Row Records, was most recently made the news in August when he was one of three people wounded during an early morning shooting at a West Hollywood nightclub. Williams is free on 75,000 bail. Knight is in Las Vegas awaiting extradition and considered a fugitive for crossing state lines. His bail is set at 1 million. ||||| It was not the first time the Death Row Records founder was injured in a shooting. In 2005, he was shot during another pre-awards party in Miami.

Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn.

His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Released on October 10, 1966, the single was an immediate critical and commercial hit, topping record charts in several countries including the US and UK. Characterized by its complex soundscapes, episodic structure, and subversions of pop music formula, it was the costliest single ever recorded at the time of its release. \\"Good Vibrations\\" later became widely acclaimed as one of the greatest masterpieces of rock music. The song has been covered by artists such as Groove Holmes, the Troggs, Charlie McCoy, and Psychic TV. John Bush commented: \\"'Good Vibrations' was rarely reprised by other acts, even during the cover-happy '60s. Its fragmented style made it essentially cover-proof.\\" In 1976, a nearly identical cover version was released as a single by Todd Rundgren for his album Faithful. When asked for his opinion, Brian said: \\"Oh, he did a marvelous job, he did a great job. I was very proud of his version.\\" Rundgren's single peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rundgren explained: \\"I used to like the sound of the Beach Boys, but it wasn't until they began to compete with the Beatles that I felt that what they were doing was really interesting--like around Pet Sounds and 'Good Vibrations' ... when they started to shed that whole surf music kind of burden and start to branch out into something that was a little more universal. ... I tried to do [the song] as literally as I could because in the intervening 10 years, radio had changed so much. Radio had become so formatted and so structured that that whole experience was already gone.\\" In 2004, Wilson re-recorded the song as a solo artist for his album Brian Wilson Presents Smile. It was sequenced as the album's closing track, following \\"In Blue Hawaii\\". In this version, \\"Good Vibrations\\" was the project's only track that eschewed the modular recording method. The song's verses and chorus were recorded as part of one whole take, and were not spliced together. In 2012, Wilson Phillips, a trio consisting of Wilson's daughters Carnie and Wendy, and John Phillips' daughter Chynna, released an album containing covers of songs by the Beach Boys and the Mamas & the Papas titled Dedicated.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - If anyone had any doubts how Pope Francis feels about people who always complain, the answer is now tacked to the door of his frugal suite in a Vatican residence: “No Whining”. A placard reading, \\"No Whining\\" is seen on Pope Francis' room door in this undated picture posted on the Vatican Insider website. Under the explicit warning, the red-and-white Italian language sing goes on to say that \\"violators are subject to a syndrome of always feeling like a victim and consequent reduction of your sense of humour and capacity to solve problems\\". REUTERS/courtesy Vatican Insider-La Stampa Under the explicit warning, the red-and-white Italian language sign goes on to say that “violators are subject to a syndrome of always feeling like a victim and the consequent reduction of your sense of humor and capacity to solve problems”. A picture of the sign was posted on the Vatican Insider website and its presence on the pope’s door confirmed to Reuters by its editor-in-chief Andrea Tornielli, an author who is close to Francis and has interviewed him several times. The sign is adorned with the international symbol for ‘no’ - a backslash in a circle. It adds: “The penalty is doubled if the violation take place in the presence of children. To get the best out of yourself, concentrate on your potential and not on your limitations.” Then the closing zinger: “Stop complaining and take steps to improve your life”. The sign was given to the pope recently by Italian psychologist and self-help author Salvo Noe. Francis promised Noe he would put it up in his office for a laugh. Francis has had no shortage of complainers in the Vatican and in the Church since his election in 2013. He has tried to steer the 1.2 billion-member Church on a more inclusive and merciful path, angering conservatives who say he his sowing doctrinal confusion. One recent episode involved German Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, a German whom the pope removed last month from his post as Vatican doctrinal chief at the end of a five-year term. Mueller, who disagrees with the pope on a number of issues, apparently expected his mandate to be renewed automatically. Mueller later told a German newspaper that the way he was treated was “unacceptable”. ||||| Whingers, whiners and moaners have been put on notice by none other than Pope Francis, who has stuck a big sign to the front door of his Vatican apartment that reads: “Complaining is forbidden”. The notice, in large white letters on a red background, appeared in recent days on the door that leads to the pontiff’s private rooms in Casa Santa Marta, the modest residence where he lives in the shadow of St Peter’s Basilica. The good-humoured notice appears to be aimed at cardinals, priests and members of his staff who may be more inclined to bring problems than solutions to the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics. Unlike his predecessors, who traditionally fled the torrid summer heat of Rome for the cooler environs of Castel Gandolfo, a papal residence in the Alban Hills outside the capital, Pope Francis eschews holidays and resolutely works through July and August.

Try washing it once a week. Switch to once every two or three weeks if your hair starts to break easily. Try to find a shampoo that doesn't leave your hair feeling too dry. To reduce damage, wash hair in lukewarm water and rinse in cool water. The heat from blow drying can cause damage, leading your hair to break before it grows to the desired length. Instead, plait your hair, wrap it in a silk scarf, and let dry overnight. Alternatively, towel dry your hair by wrapping it in a towel and simply rubbing your head for a while. Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils. Restore these with conditioner suited for African hair. Periodically deep condition your hair as well. You can use leave-in conditioner in between washes. Rub natural oil into the middle and ends of your hair to make it soft and supple. This will help prevent it breaking before it grows too long. Jamaican oil, castor oil, Moroccan oil, or lavender oil are all good options. Covering your hair with a satin scarf can help your hair take in the oil. Water strengthens dry hair and may stimulate your hair roots. You can apply water, moisturizing conditioner, or a mixture of half olive oil or half coconut oil. For extra moisture, apply each one, in that order. The oil will help seal in the moisture. If you use gel or mousse in your hairstyle, try hair jam instead. This will hold your hair, then eventually melt into oils to add shine and moisture. These can strengthen some types of hair, but may damage dry hair. Try brushing your hair: if your strands stretch significantly before breaking, you may need more protein. Do not leave in protein conditioner longer than instructed on the label, or it may turn hard and brittle. About every other day or when your scalp feels dry, apply coconut grease to the tip of your pointer finger. Apply at the top of your part and sweep back until all the grease has been applied.

Summarize this article: A birthday party at a house rented through accommodation website Airbnb was cut short when the guests discovered a decomposing corpse in the garden of the property. The group of friends made the discovery on Saturday afternoon. The body was lying face-down in a hole at the edge of the garden, partially covered by trees. They had rented the house in Palaiseau, ten miles south of Paris, for a weekend getaway to celebrate a 25th birthday. The seven-bedroom home was described in its Airbnb listing as a renovated 19th-century building with a swimming pool and a \\"lovely forest with a jogging trail\\" at the rear. It was at the edge of this woodland that they discovered the corpse, said to be in an advanced state of decomposition. The listing has now been removed from the website. Police say the body is that of a woman aged between 30 and 50, clothed but with bare feet, and that the corpse could have been in the garden for several weeks. A source told Le Parisien that investigators suspect foul play. Airbnb has come under fire previously for its marketplace model, which allows holidaymakers and property owners to bypass the traditional booking model. Critics say it allows renters to essentially operate as a business while skirting the insurance requirements and health and safety rules imposed on licensed hotels, leaving both owners and guests vulnerable. Last year, the family of a man killed when a rope swing broke at an Airbnb rental property in Texas tried to raise awareness about the lack of inspections to ensure listed properties meet safety regulations or fire codes. An Airbnb spokesman told the Huffington Post that hosts were expected to follow local rules and regulations and that the company issues a long list of advisory safety precautions. \\"Nothing is more important to us than safety,\\" he said. ||||| PARIS (AP) — French authorities are investigating the death of a woman whose decomposing body was found in the garden of an Airbnb rental in suburban Paris. Bertrand Daillie, the deputy prosecutor for Evry, said a group of young people who were renting the house for a weekend discovered the badly decomposed body in the garden near the edge of the property. He says it was covered by tree branches that had been placed there deliberately. Daillie told France Bleu radio the renters were to be questioned but had only rented the house for that weekend. According to Le Parisien newspaper, the listing was removed Sunday from Airbnb. ||||| A group of friends who rented a house via Airbnb in the Paris suburbs to hold a weekend party had their plans brought to a macabre end when they found the decomposing body of a woman in the garden. The friends found the corpse on Saturday afternoon at the bottom of a steep bank at the end of the garden in the three-storey premises in the southern suburb of Palaiseau, 10 miles south of Paris. The body was curled up, face down, in a shallow grave and had been covered with branches and logs, police said, adding that the victim was dressed but had no shoes on. Police said they were treating the woman’s death as murder. She had no identity papers on her and on Sunday, officers were still trying to find out who she was. “The state of the body, which was in an advanced stage of decomposition, did not enable investigators to determine the cause of death,” a judicial source said. A post mortem was due to be carried out. The prosecutor’s office in the nearby suburb of Evry said that “all the signs suggest that this was a criminal act.” The group who rented the house for the weekend using the online rental website were due to be questioned by police on Sunday. They cancelled plans for their Saturday night party after finding the corpse. There was no immediate information available on who owned the premises. Airbnb did not reply to a query by the Telegraph as to whether the advert for the house would be maintained on its website. Airbnb has grown at breakneck speed since it was launched in San Francisco in 2008, and now claims more than 60 million users worldwide. It has also seen a number of scandals involving theft, property damage and a range of sordid activities in hosts’ apartments. The French capital last year emerged as the world’s biggest home-sharing city, with more than 40,000 active listings on Airbnb, putting it ahead of both New York and London. The company paid nearly €1.2 million (£950,000) to Paris city authorities in the last quarter of 2015. It reached an agreement with the city last year and since October has charged users a tourist tax of 83 cents per night, which it then passes on to the town hall. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A group of friends rented a house through Airbnb for a birthday party, but when they got there, they found a decomposing body in the garden. The house was in a town near Paris, France. The body was an older woman, and the police think someone did something bad to her.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On January 1, 2008 at the Xcalibur Bowling Centre, a disco-themed bowling alley in Surrey, British Columbia, Egerton, the janitor, has allowed two groups of teenagers to bowl against one another after hours. The \\"prep\\", Steve, is still bitter after his best friend Jamie, the \\"jock\\", had sex with Lisa, a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey, Patrick, and A.J. harass the \\"tranny\\", Sam, they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve's team and Jamie's. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night. Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to \\"scare\\" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain. The four leave Lisa on the pool table, naked and barely conscious. The following night, the two groups arrive at the bowling alley to continue their tournament.
