However, without more context, it is difficult to provide a detailed answer. Here's a general overview of safety measures and handling instructions for firearms, which can serve as a basis for weapon instructions: 1. Always treat firearms as if they are loaded: This is the primary rule in gun safety. It is essential to always consider that a firearm could be loaded, even if you are sure it is not. This mindset will help prevent accidental discharges. 2. Point the firearm in a safe direction: Always be aware of where the firearm's muzzle is pointing. Keep it pointed in a safe direction, away from people, animals, and property. 3. Keep your finger off the trigger: Do not put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to shoot. Instead, keep your finger alongside the frame of the weapon, outside the trigger guard. 4. Know your target and what's behind it: Be conscious of your intended target, as well as what lies beyond it. Missing or over-penetrating shots might unintentionally cause injury or damage. 5. Use proper ammunition: Make sure to use the correct type of ammunition for your firearm. Using incorrect ammunition can result in damage to the weapon, injury, or even death. 6. Wear hearing and eye protection: Firearms are loud and can produce debris, so make sure to protect your hearing and eyes when shooting. 7. Learn and understand the mechanical and handling characteristics of the firearms you're using: Familiarize yourself with the specific features of each firearm you use. This includes the location of the safety, how to load and unload the weapon, and how the firearm operates. 8. Regular maintenance and cleaning: Clean your firearms regularly to ensure proper function and prevent any mishaps due to dirt or debris buildup. 9. Store firearms securely: When not in use, store your firearms in a secure location, such as a locked cabinet or safe, to prevent unauthorized access. 10. Educate others on firearm safety: Share your knowledge of firearm safety with others, especially children, to promote responsible gun ownership and handling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Dozens of country singers joined together for a raucous and lengthy concert on Friday night to celebrate the musical legacy of country legend George Jones. Before the Country Music Hall of Famer passed away this April at the age of 81, he had been planning a November 22 farewell concert at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville along with some guest performers. Last night the concert went ahead as planned with country’s shining stars paying tribute to the “King of Broken Hearts.” Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, George Strait, Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton were among the performers who took part in the almost four hour concert. In contrast to Jones’s funeral, a somber affair at the Grand Ole Opry House, this event was laced with laughter and fond memories. Country duo Big & Rich entered the stage atop riding mowers to warble “Love Bug,” while Vince Gill sang “Bartender’s Blues,” clad in a T-shirt that read “Sweet Pea,” the nickname Jones had bestowed upon him. After Brad Paisley sang “The One I Loved Back Then (The Corvette Song),” The Tennessean reported that he told the audience, “No was more generous to me than George Jones,” then adding, “I know he’s looking down at this and saying, ‘Son, where’s all the money goin’ for this?’” The evening ended on a poignant note with Alan Jackson performing “He Stopped Loving Her Today,” a tune he had sung at the funeral but this time he was joined by Jones’s widow, Nancy for the final choruses.

Make this proper case","completion":"These things are nice and often do make me feel happy for a while. When we engage in activities or possess things that bring us joy, it can contribute to our overall sense of well-being and happiness. However, it is important to recognize that these feelings of happiness are often temporary. Maintaining a sense of contentment and well-being requires a balance of different aspects in our lives, such as physical health, mental health, relationships, and personal achievements. Firstly, engaging in activities that promote physical health, such as exercise, helps in maintaining overall happiness. Physical activity is known to release endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that act as natural mood elevators. Regular engagement in exercise can also improve sleep patterns and increase energy levels, which in turn affect our overall mood and well-being. Secondly, mental health is another critical aspect of happiness. This can involve fostering a positive outlook on life, developing coping strategies for managing stress, and practicing mindfulness or engaging in therapeutic activities to address any underlying personal issues. Engaging in activities that nurture our mental health can help in maintaining a sense of balance and well-being. Moreover, relationships with friends, family, and loved ones play a significant role in our happiness. Cultivating positive and supportive relationships can provide us with a sense of belonging and help us navigate through life's challenges. Open communication, trust, and empathy are essential components of healthy relationships that contribute to long-term happiness. Lastly, personal achievements contribute to our sense of self-worth and satisfaction. These accomplishments can vary greatly from person to person, as different individuals are driven by unique goals and ambitions. Engaging in activities and pursuits that align with one's interests and values can often lead to a greater sense of fulfillment and happiness. In conclusion, while material items or experiences can make us feel happy for a while, it is essential to recognize that maintaining long-term happiness requires a balance of various aspects of our lives. Good physical health, mental health, relationships, and personal achievements contribute to building a strong foundation for sustained contentment and well-being. Investing time and effort in these areas can help us maintain happiness even when momentary joys fade."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The Medieval City of Levoca, located in eastern Slovakia, is a prime example of a historic town that has managed to preserve its architectural wealth and cultural heritage throughout the centuries. Declared as part of the National Cultural Heritage of Slovakia, this medieval gem is also inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, further elevating its significance and ensuring continued efforts to preserve and protect it for generations to come. Levoca is well-known for its remarkably preserved city center, which boasts a number of notable structures that continue to hold historical, architectural, and even artistic value. The town's layout, including its central square, harks back to the prosperity and influence Levoca enjoyed during the 14th to 16th centuries as a leading center of trade, culture, and education in the region. One of the most iconic buildings in Levoca is St. James Church, a Gothic masterpiece constructed between the 14th and 15th centuries. This church houses the tallest wooden altar in the world, standing at a staggering 18.6 meters (61 feet) high. It was masterfully created by renowned carver and artist Master Pavol of Levoca and is considered a crowning achievement of Gothic craftsmanship. The ornate wooden altar is a magnificent sight, adorned with intricate carvings and depictions from the Bible. Also worth mentioning is the Old Town Hall, a carefully preserved building that showcases stunning Renaissance architecture. Renovated in the 16th century in the Renaissance style, the Town Hall now serves as the Levoca City Museum, housing a collection of artifacts and documents that provide an insight into the city's rich history. Visitors to the museum will encounter evidence of Levoca's past as a hub of commerce and a stronghold of the Hungarian Kingdom. The town fortifications are another architectural marvel, with remnants of the original stone walls still encircling much of the city. The walls played a crucial role in protecting Levoca from invasions during medieval times and provide a physical reminder of the town's strategic importance. Today, these fortifications are a symbol of the city's resilience and serve as a powerful backdrop for the historic city center. Moreover, Levoca is not only significant for its historical and architectural heritage; it also played a vital role in the development of culture in the region. The town was a center of craftsmanship and artistic production, with carvers, painters, goldsmiths, and other artisans contributing to its creative dynamism. Levoca's designation as a National Cultural Heritage site and its inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List attest to this rich legacy, helping to ensure that the town's vibrant history is recognized and safeguarded for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kant region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former and the . - Etymology. The city's name was historically written as or (both read as \\"Nagoya\\"). One possible origin is the adjective , meaning 'peaceful'. - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market. - Yokohama Pidgin Japanese , Yokohamese or Japanese Ports Lingo was a Japanese - based pidgin spoken in the Yokohama area during the late 19th century for communication between Japanese and foreigners . Most information on Yokohama Pidgin comes from Exercises in the Yokohama Dialect , a humorous pamphlet published in 1879 by Hoffman Atkinson . - Historically a merchant city, Osaka has also been known as the and served as a center for the rice trade during the Edo period. - The earliest written records regarding the region come from the \\"Nihon Shoki\\", which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa Period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from , an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine. Kobe became one of Japan's 17 designated cities in 1956. - Yokohama's population of 3.7 million makes it Japan's largest city after the Special Wards of Tokyo. Yokohama developed rapidly as Japan's prominent port city following the end of Japan's relative isolation in the mid-19th century, and is today one of its major ports along with Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Hakata, Tokyo, and Chiba. - A pidgin , or pidgin language, is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common: typically, a mixture of simplified languages or a simplified primary language with other languages' elements included. It is most commonly employed in situations such as trade, or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside (but where there is no common language between the groups). Fundamentally, a pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication, as it is constructed impromptu, or by convention, between individuals or groups of people. A pidgin is not the native language of any speech community, but is instead learned as a second language. A pidgin may be built from words, sounds, or body language from multiple other languages and cultures. They allow people who have no common language to communicate with each other.

Currently, Mike has a container in his garage that is filled with two different gases. A large portion of the gas is Mologen and a smaller portion is the gas Hamogen. But I can use this background: Gas pressure results from collisions between gas particles and the inside walls of their container. If more gas is added to a rigid container, the gas pressure increases. The identities of the two gases do not matter. John Dalton, the English chemist who proposed the atomic theory, also studied mixtures of gases. He found that each gas in a mixture exerts a pressure independently of every other gas in the mixture. For example, our atmosphere is composed of about 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with smaller amounts of several other gases making up the rest. Since nitrogen makes up 78% of the gas particles in a given sample of air, it exerts 78% of the pressure. If the overall atmospheric pressure is 1.00 atm, then the pressure of just the nitrogen in the air is 0.78 atm. The pressure of the oxygen in the air is 0.21 atm.

In March 1861, Victoria's mother died, with Victoria at her side. Through reading her mother's papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply; she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for \\"wickedly\\" estranging her from her mother. To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief, Albert took on most of her duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble. In August, Victoria and Albert visited their son, the Prince of Wales, who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin, and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney. In November, Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland. Appalled, Albert travelled to Cambridge, where his son was studying, to confront him. By the beginning of December, Albert was very unwell. He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner, and died on 14 December 1861. Victoria was devastated. She blamed her husband's death on worry over the Prince of Wales's philandering. He had been \\"killed by that dreadful business\\", she said.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: After accepting the job, what are the full names of the two experts who join the former prisoner? ? After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it. However, Dortmunder cannot access the box because of bank vault security, and the gang leaves Abe in Dr. Amusa's office while they come up with a plan.

Help as much as you can. This article: Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal. Her biographer Victoria Glendinning considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West's \\"one magnificent act of creation\\". contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who greatly valued the familial connections of Sissinghurst?, what is it ?

The end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors, including the weakening power of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation and the banning of religious plays in many countries. Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the Netherlands in 1539, the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama.

Anyways, December of 2017, I went to India with my family, cuz my parents are immigrants and my maternal cousins stil live in India. For this first few days, one of my favorite cousin was in a different city because her mom was getting an operation for a tumor. She came back later, and me and my older male cousin walkled to her houes to pick her up. (It’s about a 5 minute walk). On the way back one of her friends noticed her and wanted my cousin to hang out. She went in for a few minutes, and apparently her friend thought I was hot. That’s the first time that ever happened, and I know that there is no way in hell someone in the US of A would say that to me. NGL the girl’s in India have a low expectation. Anyway I get home, and there is a follow request from her on Instagram, and this is supper bizzare cuz I don’t even know who she is. My cousin said under no cicumstances to let her follow me, but I decided to humor her. I had some fun just screwing around with her, purely teasing but that’s a whole different fiasco. Moving one, some of the poeple in India have the funnist usernames (This will be important later) . There pretty far behind on fads that have happened in America. For example, fidget spinners were just introduceted therer last year. Some of the names are super edgy because of this but I’m not gonna expose anyone here. Its been over a year, and recently her friend wished me happy birthday, which was odd because I hardly talk to her. I go to her account, and her follow ratio is fucking crazy. She has about 300 dudes following her and only follows one tik tok star from India, who recently passed away. I go full stalker mode and go through her follower list, and I find one of the funniest names of all time. The kid lives in India, and my cousin knows him, so I sent him a follow request and he accpeted about a day later. Oh. My. Lord. He’ s completely fresh of the boat, and would probably get bullied to hell in some of the public schools in America. HIs account is a gold-mine of what we would call cringe. I show him off to some off my family friends as my own personal jewl, and recently my best friend and I have had a competition to see who can get the most affection and the best response from him. My friends is currently in the lead. He kinds scared him by saying he wants to commit suicide and needed help. By far the best response. Anyways, now ALL my friends know who he is and I have begged them to add him to our group chat, but they refuse. We keep commenting on his pictures just saying stuff like I want to kiss you, I love you, you are beautiful, just the usual joking stuff. Now to my surprise, my best friend made a geroup chat including him and it’s the greatest thing that has happened since Manchester City won the league last year. We’ve been kind of leading him on, pretending we are his friends, and he’s cool about it, but here’s the kicker. One of my friends is an absolute dick to him. He despises him, because he commented on all his old posts. He did that to my friend to, whos been posting since 2014, and we got a kick out of it. BUT this other dude is being a complete prick. He’s told him to fuck off cuz he’s been having a wank and has been trying to intimidate him. NOW by Indian buddy started following a joke jock at our school. THe jock thinks he’s some sort of musical genius because he uploads rap songs to his soundcloud, and when my friend follow him, he did the exact thing you aren’t supposed to do. He commented on all of his old pictures including the one about him breaking up with his ex. And this dude is pretty pissed. I haven’t heard from my friedn for a while cuz I’ve been busy with school and stuff. But I’m genuinly kinda scared of what happens to him, because for the record the girls in India are a hell of a lot different and nicer than the one who reside in this beautiful country. So am I the asshole, for potentially making him feel bad because some of the people that I have introduced to him have been super hostile towards him?

Given the question: Process: - He air we breathe contains oxygen and other gases - Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through your body - At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide - Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas back to the lungs where it is removed from the blood stream and then exhaled - Your lungs and respiratory system automatically perform this vital process, called gas exchange - Question: suppose the lung is not able to exhale or inhale happens, how will it affect the lung is defective. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's first briefly recap the stages of gas exchange mentioned in the prompt: 1. Air containing oxygen and other gases is inhaled and enters the lungs. 2. Oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried throughout the body. 3. Oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide, a waste gas, at each body cell. 4. Carbon dioxide is transported back to the lungs via the bloodstream. 5. Carbon dioxide is removed from the bloodstream and exhaled. Now, let's consider the hypothetical scenario where the lung is defective and cannot inhale or exhale properly. We will then determine how this perturbation would affect the second effect mentioned (oxygen being moved into the bloodstream and carried throughout the body). If the lung is defective and cannot inhale or exhale effectively, there will be: 1. Reduced oxygen intake: Inability to inhale properly would result in less oxygen being available in the lungs to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Consequently, less oxygen would be transported throughout the body, impairing various essential physiological processes. 2. Accumulation of carbon dioxide: Inability to exhale effectively would hinder the efficient removal of carbon dioxide from the body. Consequently, carbon dioxide would accumulate in the lungs and bloodstream, leading to respiratory acidosis and other potential health issues. Given these consequences, the perturbation of the lung's inability to inhale or exhale would have a significant impact on the second effect mentioned – oxygen being moved into the bloodstream and carried throughout the body. Specifically, there would be less oxygen available for transportation, thus negatively affecting overall bodily function. The answer is: less effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That job? Chick-fil-A franchisee. As emails recently released under a Freedom of Information Act request reveal, Pruitt had his executive scheduler email the fast food company's chairman and president in May 2017 to ask if he'd be willing to meet with Pruitt and discuss \\"a potential business opportunity.\\" Eventually, Pruitt talked to a rep from Chick-fil-A's legal department and explained that what he had in mind was his wife becoming a franchisee, a Chick-fil-A rep confirms to the Post. That never ended up happening, though Marlyn Pruitt did begin the franchisee application. The FOIA request also reveals Scott Pruitt got in touch with the CEO of New York nonprofit Concordia and asked him to call his wife; the group ended up paying Marlyn Pruitt 2,000 and travel expenses for help organizing a conference at which Scott Pruitt spoke, though the CEO says the couple never \\"solicited a position for Mrs. Pruitt.\\" Current and former EPA aides say Pruitt mentioned his eagerness for his wife to make money and his frustration with the increased cost of having two homes, one in Oklahoma and one in DC. It is a violation of federal ethics laws for a public official to use his position or staff for private gain or to have a staffer handle personal tasks, and a former head of the Office of Government Ethics says Pruitt's behavior on his wife's behalf could be a misuse of public office.

Emails released under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request have brought Pruitt's actions to light, raising additional questions about the ethics of the EPA chief. The FOIA-requested emails show that Pruitt's executive scheduler contacted Chick-fil-A's chairman and president, Dan Cathy, in May 2017, requesting a meeting to discuss \\"a potential business opportunity.\\" Subsequently, Pruitt spoke with a representative from Chick-fil-A's legal department, explaining that he envisioned his wife, Marlyn Pruitt, becoming a franchisee. While Marlyn Pruitt initiated the franchisee application, the bid to become a Chick-fil-A franchisee was ultimately unsuccessful. The FOIA request also highlighted Pruitt's attempts to secure other employment for his wife, including reaching out to the CEO of New York nonprofit organization Concordia. Marlyn Pruitt eventually received 2,000 and travel expenses for her work in assisting with the organization of a conference where Scott Pruitt was a speaker. Concordia's CEO has clarified that the couple did not \\"solicit a position\\" for Marlyn Pruitt during the process. Both current and former EPA aides have noted Pruitt's desire for his wife to earn money, expressing his frustration with the financial demands of maintaining homes in both Oklahoma and Washington, DC. These revelations surrounding Pruitt's efforts to assist his wife in securing work have raised serious ethical concerns. Federal ethics laws dictate that public officials are forbidden from using their position or staff for personal gain or from requiring staff members to handle personal tasks. The former head of the Office of Government Ethics has stated that Pruitt's actions pertaining to his wife's employment could be considered a misuse of public office. In addition to these ethical concerns, the Government Accountability Office announced on Tuesday that it would investigate whether a tweet sent from the official EPA account constituted \\"partisan taunting.\\" As Pruitt continues to face scrutiny for his conduct in his position as EPA head, further investigations will explore the potential misuse of public office and broader ethical issues within the organization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Every pet owner loves his pet. There is no argument here. But when we asked our readers whether they would clone (, )their beloved animals, the responses were split almost down the middle. Of the 228 readers who answered it, 108 would clone, 111 would not and nine weighed each side without offering an opinion. Clearly, from readers' response, this is an issue that reaches deeply into both the joy and _ . It speaks, as well, to people's widely differing expectations over the developing scientific procedure. Most of the respondents who favored the idea strongly believed it would produce at least a close copy of the original; many felt the process would actually return an exact copy. Those on the other side, however, held little hope a clone could never truly recreate a pet, many simply didn't wish to go against the natural law of life and death. Both sides expressed equal love for their animals. More than a few respondents owned \\"the best dog/cat in the world\\". They thought of their pets as their \\"best friend\\", \\"a member of the family,\\"\\"the light of my life.\\" They told moving stories of pets' heroism, intelligence and selfless devotion. Then the loss is so disturbing---and the cloning so attractive. \\"People become very close to their animals, and the loss can be just as hard to bear as when a friend or family member dies,\\" says Gary Kowalski, author of Goodbye, Friend: Healing Wisdom for Anyone Who Has Ever Lost a Pet. \\"For me, cloning feels like an attempt to turn death away...It's understandable.

Engineered wood products are becoming a bigger part of the construction industry. They may be used in both residential and commercial buildings as structural and aesthetic materials. What industry benefits greatly from engineered wood products?","completion":"The construction industry benefits greatly from engineered wood products. These products have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their numerous advantages over traditional building materials. Engineered wood products are used in both residential and commercial construction for structural and aesthetic purposes. The increased adoption of these products has led to several advantages for the construction industry as a whole, which can be outlined as follows: 1. Cost-effectiveness: Engineered wood products are often more cost-effective than traditional building materials such as concrete and steel. This is because they require less raw material, labor, and energy for production. In addition, the lighter weight of these products can lead to cost savings in transportation and handling. 2. Sustainability: Engineered wood products are made from renewable resources, primarily small trees and wood waste from the timber industry. The use of these products promotes sustainable forest management practices and reduces the carbon footprint of the building industry. Moreover, manufacturing processes of engineered wood products generally produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions when compared to the production of concrete and steel. 3. Design flexibility: Engineered wood products offer a high degree of design flexibility, as they can be easily customized to suit a wide variety of construction and architectural needs. This versatility allows for innovative designs and creative solutions to be employed in both residential and commercial construction projects. 4. Strength and durability: Despite their lighter weight, engineered wood products are often stronger than traditional materials due to their engineered nature. They are designed and manufactured to have specific strength properties, which can lead to increased durability and a longer lifespan for buildings. 5. Energy efficiency: Engineered wood products provide excellent insulation properties and contribute to better energy efficiency in buildings, reducing energy consumption and related costs. The performance of these products can be further enhanced with the addition of insulation materials. 6. Speed of construction: The prefabricated nature of engineered wood products allows for faster and more efficient construction compared to traditional building methods. This translates to shorter project timelines and lower labor costs, which can save time and money for developers, contractors, and homeowners. 7. Aesthetics: The natural beauty of wood can enhance the visual appeal of both residential and commercial buildings. Engineered wood products offer a range of options for incorporating wood aesthetics into construction projects, from structural elements such as beams and columns to decorative features like cladding and interior finishes. In summary, the construction industry benefits greatly from the use of engineered wood products by offering cost-effective, versatile, sustainable, strong, durable, and energy-efficient building materials. All these factors contribute to enhancing the overall performance and quality of construction projects while promoting a more environmentally responsible approach to building and urban development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: John William Money (8 July 1921 - 7 July 2006) was a psychologist, sexologist and author, specializing in research into sexual identity and biology of gender. He was one of the first scientists to study the psychology of sexual fluidity and how the societal constructs of \\"gender\\" affect an individual. More recent academic studies have criticized Money's work in many respects, particularly in regards to his involvement with the sex-reassignment of David Reimer and his eventual suicide. Money's writing has been translated into many languages, and includes around 2,000 articles, books, chapters and reviews. Context: Born in Morrinsville, New Zealand, to a family of English and Welsh descent, Money initially studied psychology at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating with a double master's degree in psychology and education in 1944. Money was a junior member of the psychology faculty at the University of Otago in Dunedin, but in 1947, at the age of 26, he emigrated to the United States to study at the Psychiatric Institute of the University of Pittsburgh. He left Pittsburgh and earned his PhD from Harvard University in 1952. He was married briefly in the 1950s but had no children. Money proposed and developed several theories and related terminology, including gender identity, gender role, gender-identity/role, and lovemap. He coined the term paraphilia (appearing in the DSM-III) to replace perversions and introduced the term sexual orientation in place of sexual preference, arguing that attraction is not necessarily a matter of free choice. Money was a professor of pediatrics and medical psychology at Johns Hopkins University from 1951 until his death. He also established the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic in 1965 along with Claude Migeon who was the head of plastic surgery at Johns Hopkins. The hospital began performing sexual reassignment surgery in 1966. At Johns Hopkins, Money was also involved with the Sexual Behaviors Unit, which ran studies on sex-reassignment surgery. He received the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal in 2002 from the German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research. Money was an early supporter of New Zealand's arts, both literary and visual. He was a noted friend and supporter of author Janet Frame. In 2002, as his Parkinson's disease worsened, Money donated a substantial portion of his art collection to the Eastern Southland Art Gallery in Gore, New Zealand. In 2003, the New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, opened the John Money wing at the Eastern Southland Gallery. Money died 7 July 2006, one day before his 85th birthday, in Towson, Maryland, of complications from Parkinson's disease. Question: what happened in his childhood?

Although František now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty gulden, and no immediate prospects. Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kateřina Kolářová's mother to Josef Proksch, head of the Prague Music Institute—where Kateřina was now studying. Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on Beethoven, Chopin, Berlioz and the Leipzig circle of Liszt. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.For the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the G minor Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work—they detected too much of Berlioz in it. Meanwhile, his friendship with Kateřina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist. Guess a valid title for it!

Chad Varah, a British Anglican priest who lived from 1911 to 2007 is probably best remembered for being the founder of which charity organisation in 1953 ????","completion":"Chad Varah, a British Anglican priest who lived from 1911 to 2007, is best remembered for being the founder of the Samaritans, a renowned charity organization, in 1953. The Samaritans, originally named \\"The Samaritan Movement\\" or \\"The 999 Club,\\" has since grown to become an influential and vital institution, providing emotional support to individuals in distress and contemplating suicide. Born in Lincolnshire, England, Chad Varah had a lifelong concern regarding the welfare of people on the verge of mental breakdowns and those feeling isolated or overwhelmed by personal issues. When Varah was 14, he conducted the funeral of a teenage girl who had committed suicide, an incident that would later inspire him to establish the Samaritans. In 1953, while serving as a vicar at St. Stephen Walbrook Church in London, Varah launched the Samaritans after reading a newspaper article about suicide. The article discussed multiple cases of people dying by suicide, which deeply troubled Varah, and he resolved to create a safe space for these vulnerable individuals. He aimed to offer a listening ear and non-judgmental, confidential support. Initially, Chad Varah himself was the primary listener, providing emotional support to those who called or visited his vicarage. Realizing that the demand was beyond the capacity of one person, he recruited and trained several volunteers to help with the cause. The Samaritans adopted the philosophy of 'befriending, listening, and understanding,' helping those in need to explore their feelings and navigate through their emotional turmoil without passing judgment. Seeing the immense impact of the organization in the United Kingdom, Varah's work inspired similar suicide prevention helplines and organizations around the world. Today, the Samaritans has over 200 branches in Britain and Ireland, with more than 20,000 active volunteers. Moreover, the Samaritans' helpline (116 123 in the UK and Ireland) operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, continuing to offer free, confidential emotional support for those facing a crisis or feeling overwhelmed by their emotions. In addition to the support offered by the helpline, Samaritans also provide outreach to various community settings such as schools, homeless shelters, and prisons. The organization engages in research activities and collaborates with other mental health agencies to improve suicide prevention strategies and policies. Overall, Chad Varah, a British Anglican priest, has left an indelible mark in the field of mental health and suicide prevention through founding the Samaritans in 1953. His work has saved countless lives, provided a light in the darkness for those struggling with their emotions, and made vital strides toward destigmatizing mental health and suicide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: The gardener is a man.","completion":"Based on the provided text, it is impossible to definitively conclude that the gardener is a man. The text does mention the presence of a gardener, as it states, \\"they got a cabbage-leaf full of raspberries from the gardener\\"; however, it does not specify the gardener's gender. In modern times, both men and women can hold positions as gardeners, making it impossible to assume the gardener's gender solely based on their occupation. Furthermore, the text focuses on the actions of Father, Mother, and Miss Blake, who play a more central role in this narrative. These individuals are mentioned doing various activities, such as paying calls, riding a bicycle, and leaving the premises. However, details about the gardener are limited, with only a brief mention of their contribution in providing the raspberries. Consequently, as there is no explicit information about the gardener's gender in the provided text, it would be inaccurate and presumptuous to assume their gender. Thus, the sentence \\"The gardener is a man\\" is not necessarily true based on the available information. To arrive at a definitive conclusion about the gardener's gender, one would need additional details, either from the surrounding context or by seeking clarification from the author. Without such information, the gardener's gender remains unspecified and open to interpretation, making it impossible to confirm the sentence's accuracy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Reduction in flow caused by dams, diversions, water for thermoelectric power stations, and evaporation losses from reservoirs -- the latter of which consumes more than 15 percent of the river's natural runoff -- has had severe ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California. Historically, the delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Gulf. Today's desiccated delta, at only a fraction of its former size, no longer provides suitable habitat, and populations of fish, shrimp and sea mammals in the gulf have seen a dramatic decline. Since 1963, the only times when the Colorado River has reached the ocean have been during El Niño events in the 1980s and 1990s. Multi-choice problem: Is it true that does the colorado river still reach the ocean? Pick your answer from: +no. +yes. The answer is:","completion":"+no. The Colorado River no longer reaches the ocean regularly. This is because the water flow has been reduced by things like dams and evaporation from reservoirs.

Pakistan is like a kid who wants a toy that helps it play in its backyard. For Pakistan, the Russian Mil Mi-35 attack helicopter is like a really good toy that lets them play their games pretty well, like protecting their home or joining in on team games. It's also less expensive, so they can buy more toys without using all their allowance. The Kamov Ka-52 might be a fancier toy with more shiny features, but it's also more expensive, and sometimes it's not as easy to play with. So, Pakistan decided that the Mil Mi-35 is a good fit for them. 2. India is like a different kid who is playing in a different backyard. They needed a toy that fits their games too.

Context: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

D-I schools include the major collegiate athletic powers, with larger budgets, more elaborate facilities, and more athletic scholarships than Divisions II and III as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition. - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - A touchdown is a means of scoring in both American and Canadian football. Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone. - Canadian football is a form of gridiron football played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play long and wide attempting to advance a pointed prolate spheroid ball into the opposing team's scoring area (end zone). - The Connecticut State Universities (CSU) are part of the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities, the largest public higher education system in Connecticut, and the second largest in New England. The four comprehensive state universities enroll almost 35,000 students and 180,000 alumni. The first of the universities to be founded was Central Connecticut State University, established in 1849 as a normal school for teacher education. Over time the other three institutions were founded as normal schools and in 1959 they were converted into state colleges to reflect their expanded mission. From their founding until 1965, they were overseen by the Connecticut State Department of Education. In 1965 the General Assembly transferred control of the then-colleges to an independent Board of Trustees. In 1983 the four institutions were converted into universities, together constituting the Connecticut State University System. - The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC).

Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC. - American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. - The College Football Hall of Fame is a hall of fame and museum devoted to college football.

What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who displayed an abstract \\"Mother and Child' in the front garden of his house? from the following article ? In 1932, after six year's teaching at the Royal College, Moore took up a post as the Head of the Department of Sculpture at the Chelsea School of Art. Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time. From this time, Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work, and through his position as member of the Arts Council of Great Britain he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The answer to this question is: Penrose. In the article, it states that \\"In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead.\\" So, Roland Penrose is the person who displayed the abstract \\"Mother and Child\\" in the front garden of his house."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A German-language folk band have been asked to return 13 awards after it emerged that they have been 'faking' the music on their albums. The seven-man Kastelruther Spatzen used studio musicians to create their famous Alpine brass-band sound, their former producer claims. The revelations have made the headlines in Germany echoing the scandal surrounding early 90s lip-syncing pop-sensation Milli Vanilli. 'Fake': Folk music favourites Kastelruther Spatzen are being accused of 'faking music' after it emerged they use studio musicians. Kastelruther Spatzen, from the German-speaking. province of South Tyrol in northern Italy, were defended by their. manager who said using studio musicians were 'common practice'. 'The success of this band is based on a. giant fraud,' former producer Walter Widemair told Bild newspaper. He said that only the lead singer's voice was genuine on the albums and called for the group to return their prices. 'The band of fakes must give back their Echo awards,' he said. Kastelruther Spatzen's manager Helmut Brossmann said that it was common practice for folk music bands to use studio musicians for their albums. In his defence of the popular folk-music band, he said Kastelruther Spatzen had even listed the studio musicians on their albums. Retro fake: Late 80s German pop duo Milli Vanilli were discovered to have been lip-syncing to others vocals and were forced to return their 1990 Grammy Award. Real thing: Their former producer said lead singer Norbert Rier, seen here accepting a Folk Music award in Germany earlier this year, was the only 'genuine' voice on the albums. In a statement on the band's website Mr. Brossmann said Widemair had been responsible for the studio recordings. for nearly 30 years and was now betraying the band for commercial. reasons - to help promote his own book. 'The names of the studio musician and everyone who contributed to the chorus of songs was mentioned in every CD that they were involved in,' said Brossmann. 'In nearly 30 years of concert tours, they always played and sang everything live.' Praised: Kastelruther Spatzen after winning Best Folk Music at the Echo Awards in 2007, an award which may now be taken from them. The dispute has received much media attention in Germany, with newspapers recalling the scandal of their fellow countrymen in pop duo Milli Vanilli. German producer Frank Farian turned two young Munich models, Robert Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan, into the group known as Milli Vanilli. The group had great international success in the late 80s and early 90s with songs such as 'Girl You Know It's True' and 'Blame It On The Rain', but were disgraced when it emerged that they had been miming to other people's vocals. They were stripped of their 1990 Grammy Award and their management faced over 20 lawsuits.

In the Paleozoic Era the Pangaean supercontinent consisted of a single tectonic plate; it broke into separate plates during the Mesozoic Era and the Tethys sea developed between Laurasia and Gondwana during the Jurassic Period. The Tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the Alpide belt, from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia—a process that began at the end of the Mesozoic and continues into the present. The formation of the Alps was a segment of this orogenic process, caused by the collision between the African and the Eurasian plates that began in the late Cretaceous Period. Question: The Tethys sea developed during what period of time?","completion":"The Tethys Sea developed during the Jurassic Period, which is a geologic time period that occurred between approximately 201.3 million years ago and 145 million years ago. This period is characterized by the predominance of dinosaurs on Earth and it falls within the Mesozoic Era, the time frame that lies between the Paleozoic Era and the Cenozoic Era. During the Jurassic Period, the Pangaean supercontinent, which had formed during the Paleozoic Era as a single tectonic plate, started to break apart into separate plates. As these plates drifted apart, the Tethys Sea began to develop, creating a vast expanse of water between the Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south. Laurasia and Gondwana would later split to form the continents we recognize today. The Tethys Sea played a crucial role in the process of the Alpine orogeny, the formation of mountain ranges. As the Earth's tectonic plates continued to move, the Tethys Sea was eventually squeezed between the colliding plates, giving rise to a series of mountain ranges collectively known as the Alpide belt. This belt stretches from Gibraltar in the west to the Himalayas in the east and further to Indonesia in the southeast. The formation of the Alps was a part of this mountain-building process, resulting from the collision between the African and Eurasian plates, which began in the Late Cretaceous Period, around 100 to 66 million years ago. This process has been ongoing for millions of years and continues to shape the Earth's landscape even today. In summary, the Tethys Sea developed during the Jurassic Period, between 201.3 and 145 million years ago, as the Pangaean supercontinent began to break apart into separate plates. The subsequent tectonic activity and plate collisions led to the formation of the Alpide belt, including the Alps, which continue to evolve through geological processes to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral.... answer the following question: What is the first name of the person whose influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial?

Gareth Bale's first season at Real Madrid: an appraisal Six weeks ago Gareth Bale turned up for a Wales friendly – no mean feat for a man of his ability – and scored a goal that only he could score. He picked up the ball in his own half and went haring down the wing. Bale was in the right-back position but, aware of the threat he poses from anywhere on a football field, the Iceland defender barged him off the pitch and towards the advertising hoardings. Undeterred, Bale took an outside line and kept sprinting, gathering pace as he galloped down the sidelines. He had only one thought: to attack the goal. He approached another defender, shimmied on to his left foot, and swept the ball past the keeper. He did it again last night. Only this time he was not playing in front of 13,000 Wales fans at the Cardiff City Stadium. He was playing for Real Madrid, in front of King Juan Carlos of Spain and the Barcelona defence, and his sprint up the touchline took him closer to the 55,000 fans who had packed into the Mestalla to watch the Copa del Rey final. The Madrid press, who had demanded a big game from Bale in the absence of the injured Cristiano Ronaldo, were duty satisfied. \\"Do not be surprised if you dream about centaurs,\\" warned Juanma Trueba in AS last night. \\"Bale was Bolt\\", read the headline on El Pais, with José Sámano's reporting that \\"lightning\\" had decided the Cup final: \\"Usain Bolt appeared with Welsh legs and put Real Madrid on the throne.\\" The story of Bale's season cannot be reduced to one match. He has provided 20 goals and 15 assists, could still complete the treble, and has not lost his love of the spectacular finish: But has he done enough? He has outshone the other expensive import to La Liga this season, Neymar, who looked like a jumped-up youth-team player in the Copa del Rey final. But he has not impacted games like Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, who have scored 82 goals between them this season. Was €100m a fair price for Bale, or should Bale be doing even more for Real Madrid? Has Bale been a success and was he worth the €100m transfer fee?

It starts by highlighting his exceptional performances for Wales and draws a comparison to his impact for Real Madrid.

The piece discusses the stats of Bale's season, which includes 20 goals and 15 assists, and his potential to complete a treble with Real Madrid. It compares his performances to Neymar, another expensive import to La Liga, asserting that Bale has outshined the Brazilian. However, Bale's impact is still considered to be less than that of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi who have scored a combined total of 82 goals in that same season. The central question raised in the article is whether Gareth Bale has been a success at Real Madrid and whether his €100 million transfer fee was justified.

Despite the presence of camera crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c. 17 minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one. There is no film of the death of the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up. Several commentators questioned what time the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad arrived at the hospital; why there seemed to be little blood on the ground where they were shot; and whether any bullets were collected. Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, it is clear that protesters are play acting. One physician maintained that Jamal's scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.There was no criminal inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists to photograph the scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.A pathologist examined the boy's body, but there was no full autopsy.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Who is dating Fallow? Title: The Bonfire of the Vanities Movie plot: Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a Wall Street investor who makes millions while enjoying the good life and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith), a Southern belle gold digger. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and the two find themselves in the \\"war-zone\\" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two suspicious black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire placed purposely in the middle of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers and putting him in a coma. The two drive away and decide not to report the accident to the police. Meanwhile, indigent alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis), anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss (F. Murray Abraham), who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White (Morgan Freeman), almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes. Finally, Sherman is left without any allies to support him except for the sympathetic Judge Leonard White and the remorseful Fallow. Fallow gains a tremendous advantage and insight into the case when he is dating a woman who is the sub-letting landlady of Maria's apartment, and knows of secret recordings of conversations in the apartment...

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Different wavelength electromagnetic radiations have different uses. John is a physicist. He needed to find appropriate wavelength electromagnetic radiations for his experiments. To that end, he selected three electromagnetic radiations, microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. He noted microwaves as case A, infrared as case B, and visible light as case C. But I can use this background: Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively. IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves. Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by \\"feel.\\" Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads, called \\"pits\\". Bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kilowatt per square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 53% is infrared radiation, 44% is visible light, and 3% is ultraviolet radiation. What is an answer for this question: Which wavelengths would be longer, case A or case B? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, different wavelength electromagnetic radiations have various uses, and John, a physicist, has selected three types - microwaves (Case A), infrared light (Case B), and visible light (Case C). Infrared light has a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, corresponding to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz. Infrared wavelengths are longer than visible light but shorter than microwaves. Now, to answer the question concerning which wavelengths are longer between Cases A and B, we can recall the information about their positions within the electromagnetic spectrum. Since Case A represents microwaves and Case B represents infrared light, we know that the wavelengths of microwaves are longer than those of infrared light. Therefore, the wavelengths in Case A (microwaves) would be longer than those in Case B (infrared light)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Georgette Heyer (; 16 August 1902 - 4 July 1974) was an English historical romance and detective fiction novelist. Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story for her younger brother into the novel The Black Moth. While holidaying with her family in December 1920, Heyer met George Ronald Rougier, who was two years her senior. The two became regular dance partners while Rougier studied at the Royal School of Mines to become a mining engineer. In the spring of 1925, shortly after the publication of her fifth novel, they became engaged. One month later, Heyer's father died of a heart attack. He left no pension, and Heyer assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14. Two months after her father's death, on 18 August, Heyer and Rougier married in a simple ceremony. In October 1925 Rougier was sent to work in the Caucasus Mountains, partly because he had learned Russian as a child. Heyer remained at home and continued to write. In 1926, she released These Old Shades, in which the Duke of Avon courts his own ward. Unlike her first novel, These Old Shades focused more on personal relationships than on adventure. The book appeared in the midst of the 1926 United Kingdom general strike; as a result, the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews, or advertising. Nevertheless, the book sold 190,000 copies. Because the lack of publicity had not harmed the novel's sales, Heyer refused for the rest of her life to promote her books, even though her publishers often asked her to give interviews. She once wrote to a friend that \\"as for being photographed at Work or in my Old World Garden, that is the type of publicity which I find nauseating and quite unnecessary. My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.\\" Rougier returned home in the summer of 1926, but within months he was sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika. Heyer joined him there the following year. They lived in a hut made of elephant grass located in the bush; Heyer was the first white woman her servants had ever seen. While in Tanganyika, Heyer wrote The Masqueraders; set in 1745, the book follows the romantic adventures of siblings who pretend to be of the opposite sex in order to protect their family, all former Jacobites. Although Heyer did not have access to all of her reference material, the book contained only one anachronism: she placed the opening of White's a year too early. She also wrote an account of her adventures, titled \\"The Horned Beast of Africa\\", which was published in 1929 in the newspaper The Sphere. In 1928, Heyer followed her husband to Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner. After a failed experiment running a gas, coke, and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer's aunts. Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide the bulk of the family's earnings with her writing. What happened during their marriage?","completion":"During Georgette Heyer's marriage to George Ronald Rougier, the couple experienced several significant events and challenges. After getting married in 1925, Rougier was sent to work in the Caucasus Mountains, while Heyer stayed at home to write. They spent some time apart, but when Rougier returned in 1926, the couple's reunion was short-lived as he was soon sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika, where Heyer joined him the following year. They lived in a hut made of elephant grass, and during this time, Heyer continued to write novels, including The Masqueraders. In 1928, the couple moved to Macedonia, but due to a life-threatening incident where Heyer almost died after improperly administered anesthesia, she insisted on returning to England before starting a family. In 1929, Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner of the family. To support the family, Rougier attempted to run a gas, coke, and lighting company, but later purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money borrowed from Heyer's aunts. Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier manage it, while Heyer continued her writing career, ensuring the financial well-being of her family. Throughout their marriage, they faced various challenges, such as work-related separations and financial struggles, but they persevered and managed to overcome these obstacles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your ability to get a loan will depend on your credit history, including your credit score, overall indebtedness, and your income. You should obtain a free copy of your credit report and review it for errors. Dispute anything that is inaccurate. Get your free copy by calling 1-877-322-8228 or visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com. You will need to provide your name, address, date of birth, and Social Security Number. Common errors include accounts with the wrong balance or limit listed, or accounts inaccurately reported as delinquent or closed. If you default on your loan, your credit history will take a hit. Also, you will lose the collateral you pledged. Accordingly, calculate what you can afford for a loan payment each month. You may need to create a budget to determine how much you can comfortably borrow. Calculate your fixed expenses, such as your rent or mortgage, and then see how much you can reduce other expenses, such as entertainment or travel expenses. Avoid borrowing too much. Because you will likely receive a lower interest rate on a secured loan, you might be tempted to borrow more than you need. Don't! Get the process started by contacting lenders and asking for a secured loan. Tell them the amount you want and what you are willing to pledge as collateral. Ask them about the application process and any timelines. Find out what collateral they accept. Lenders are not required to accept collateral, so you should check whether or not they will accept what you have to offer. If not, talk about what else you might be able to pledge. The lender will review your application and decide whether or not to extend a loan. The length of this process will depend on the lender. If you have questions, call the loan officer you have been working with. You need to comparison shop by looking at the terms offered by many different lenders. Remember, you have not taken out the loan until you sign for it. Compare the following: APR. The annual percentage rate is the interest rate you will pay on the loan. It also might include other charges, such as credit charges. Typically, the lower the APR, the less expensive the loan. Length of the loan repayment. The longer you have to pay back the loan, the less you will pay each month. However, you will pay more in the end, because of accrued interest. Monthly payment amount. Prepayment penalties. Some lenders charge extra fees if you pay off a loan early. Try to find a lender who does not charge these penalties. Ask the lender if you can get copies of all the documents you need to sign. You will want sufficient time to review everything. Make sure you understand all conditions before signing. If you do not understand what you are reading, then contact an attorney to help you. At closing, remember to review the documents to make sure nothing has changed since you were approved for the loan. In fact, you should ask this question of the loan officer.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of maintaining good credit history, obtaining a free credit report to catch errors, cautiously calculating loan affordability, seeking secured loans from various lenders, comparing loan terms, and comprehending all conditions before finalizing a loan agreement to make responsible borrowing decisions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Treaty: After their adoption, treaties as well as their amendments have to follow the official legal procedures of the United Nations, as applied by the Office of Legal Affairs, including signature, ratification and entry into force. What are three official legal procedures of the United Nations that all treaties must follow after their adoption?","completion":"The United Nations serves as a key platform for the establishment of international treaties, which are critical for fostering cooperation, diplomacy, and the observance of international law among Member States. After a treaty's adoption, there are three primary official legal procedures that must be followed, as managed by the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs. These legal procedures ensure the proper functioning and implementation of the treaty among the participating countries. 1. Signature: The first official procedure is the signature of the treaty by the respective Member States. The signature marks an initial step in which parties express their intention to comply with the treaty's terms and conditions. Each state typically authorizes a specific representative, often their ambassador or respective foreign minister, to sign the treaty on behalf of their nation. A signing ceremony is usually organized during which the representatives from participating countries gather and sign the treaty. The act of signing indicates their country's political commitment to adhering to the treaty's principles and abiding by its provisions in good faith. However, signing does not necessarily make the treaty legally binding yet. 2. Ratification: After the signing ceremony, the ratification process takes place to establish the treaty as legally binding for each state party. Ratification is the act by which each nation's government gives its formal consent to be bound by the treaty, typically after having obtained the approval of its parliament or the appropriate legislative authority. The ratification demonstrates that the countries involved have the intention to uphold the treaty's provisions in both domestic and international law. Each nation follows its specific constitutional guidelines to ratify the treaty, which may involve the passage of domestic legislation or the approval by certain governmental bodies. Once completed, the ratification instruments are deposited with the United Nations Secretary-General or another designated depositary. 3. Entry into Force: The final legal procedure for a treaty is the entry into force, which is when the treaty officially becomes legally binding for the participating countries. The requirements for a treaty to enter into force are usually specified in the treaty text itself, often in the form of a specific number of ratifications or a specified date upon which the treaty's provisions become effective. Entry into force means that the treaty principles and obligations are now integrated into the international legal system and are binding on the state parties. From this point on, these states are expected to comply with and fulfill their duties under the treaty in accordance with international law. In summary, the three primary official legal procedures of the United Nations that all treaties must follow after their adoption are the signature, ratification, and entry into force. These procedures are essential in ensuring the legitimacy, legal binding nature, and effective implementation of a treaty among the Member States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your questions can be extractive, abstractive, or yes-no questions. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: We follow the same scheme as BIBREF47 to annotate the MT outputs with coreference chains. This scheme allows the annotator to define each markable as a certain mention type (pronoun, NP, VP or clause). The mentions can be defined further in terms of their cohesive function (antecedent, anaphoric, cataphoric, comparative, substitution, ellipsis, apposition). Antecedents can either be marked as simple or split or as entity or event. The annotation scheme also includes pronoun type (personal, possessive, demonstrative, reflexive, relative) and modifier types of NPs (possessive, demonstrative, definite article, or none for proper names), see BIBREF46 for details. The mentions referring to the same discourse item are linked between each other. We use the annotation tool MMAX2 BIBREF48 which was also used for the annotation of ParCorFull. In the next step, chain members are annotated for their correctness. For the incorrect translations of mentions, we include the following error categories: gender, number, case, ambiguous and other. The latter category is open, which means that the annotators can add their own error types during the annotation process. With this, the final typology of errors also considered wrong named entity, wrong word, missing word, wrong syntactic structure, spelling error and addressee reference.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Territory of Papua and New Guinea was established by an administrative union between the Australian-administered territories of Papua and New Guinea in 1949. In 1972, the name of the Territory changed to \\"Papua New Guinea\\" and in 1975 it became the independent nation of Papua New Guinea. - Pomerania is a region on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in Central Europe, split between Germany and Poland. - The Battle of Cape Gloucester was a battle in the Pacific theater of World War II between Japanese and Allied forces which took place on the island of New Britain , Territory of New Guinea , between late December 1943 and April 1944 . The battle was a major part of Operation Cartwheel , the main Allied strategy in the South West Pacific Area and Pacific Ocean Areas during 1943 -- 44 , and was the second World War II landing of the U.S. 1st Marine Division , after Guadalcanal . - The Territory of New Guinea was an Australian administered territory on the island of New Guinea from 1920 until 1975. In 1949, the Territory and the Territory of Papua were established in an administrative union by the name of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. That administrative union was renamed as Papua New Guinea in 1971. Notwithstanding that it was part of an administrative union, the Territory of New Guinea at all times retained a distinct legal status and identity until the advent of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea. - Rabaul is a township in East New Britain province, on the island of New Britain, in the country of Papua New Guinea. New Britain is an island about 60 kilometres to the east of the island of New Guinea. Rabaul was the provincial capital and most important settlement in the province until it was destroyed in 1994 by falling ash of a volcanic eruption. - New Britain, is the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago (named after Otto von Bismarck) of Papua New Guinea. It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George's Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan. While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern (\\"New Pomerania\\"). - Kimbe is the capital of the province of West New Britain in Papua New Guinea. It is a port town on the great Kimbe Bay which boasts more than 60 percent of the coral species of the entire Indo-Pacific. The bustling town of Kimbe is the third largest port in Papua New Guinea and is the fastest growing city in the South Pacific. Accommodation in Kimbe is readily available in many high-class resorts and hotels, as well as many budget guesthouses and motels dribbled along the province. The town of Kimbe is served by Hoskins Airport. - Vitiaz Strait is a strait between New Britain and the Huon Peninsula, northern New Guinea. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - German New Guinea was the first part of the German colonial empire. It was a protectorate from 1884 until 1914 when it fell to Australian forces following the outbreak of the First World War. It consisted of the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups. The mainland part of German New Guinea and the nearby islands of the Bismarck Archipelago and the North Solomon Islands are now part of Papua New Guinea. The Micronesian islands of German New Guinea are now governed as the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, the Northern Mariana Islands and Palau. - Operation Cartwheel (19431944) was a major military strategy for the Allies in the Pacific theater of World War II. Cartwheel was a twin-axis of advance operation, aimed at militarily neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The operation was directed by the Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA)General Douglas MacArthurwhose forces advanced along the northeast coast of New Guinea and occupied nearby islands. Allied forces from the Pacific Ocean Areas commandunder Admiral Chester W. Nimitzadvanced through the Solomon Islands toward Bougainville. The Allied forces involved were from Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the US and various Pacific Islands. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Cape Gloucester (also known as Tuluvu) is a headland on the northern side of the far west of the island of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. During World War II, the Japanese captured New Britain, and had driven most of Cape Gloucester's native population out to construct two airfields. During the New Britain Campaign, American forces had decided to capture Cape Gloucester for its two airfields, to assist planned attacks on the garrison on Rabaul, an important area in New Britain. It became the site of the Battle of Cape Gloucester, part of Operation Cartwheel, in 1943. After long fighting through rain, and Japanese, the United States 1st Marine Division had it declared secured. After the war, the headland was given back to the natives. - Papua New Guinea (PNG Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815 30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck, was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890. In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, significantly and deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \\"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers.\\" - The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and is part of the Islands Region of Papua New Guinea. Its area is about 50,000 square km. - Kokopo is the capital of East New Britain in Papua New Guinea. The capital was moved from Rabaul in 1994 when the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan erupted. As a result, the population of the town increased more than sixfold from 3,150 in 1990 to 20,262 in 2000. - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy. - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - The Territory of Papua comprised the southeastern quarter of the island of New Guinea from 1883 to 1975. In 1883, the Government of Queensland annexed this territory for the British Empire. The United Kingdom Government refused to ratify the annexation but in 1884 a Protectorate was proclaimed over the territory, then called \\"British New Guinea\\". There is a certain ambiguity about the exact date on which the entire territory was annexed by the British. The Papua Act 1905 recites that this happened \\"on or about\\" 4 September 1888. On 18 March 1902, the Territory was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia. Resolutions of acceptance were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, who accepted the territory under the name of Papua.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. A woman named Cameo Crispi tried to set her ex-boyfriend's home on fire by burning a pound of bacon, police have said. The 31-year-old mother from Uintah County, Utah was arrested on March 14 and has been charged with arson. Her arrest came after her ex-boyfriend called Naples police to say that he had received numerous phone calls and texts from Crispi in just an hour and wanted her to stop, charging documents said. Caught: Cameo Crispi, left in her mug shot and right on Facebook, has been accused of trying to set her ex's home on fire by leaving a pound of bacon on the stove and scattering hot coals on the floor. Speaking with officers, he also said that he did not want her at his house. When an officer went to the home, he found Crispi there and noted she was drunk. He also saw smoke coming out of the front door, the Deseret News reported. 'I asked to come in and observed a wood stove left open with a fire burning inside and hot coals on the floor around the stove,' the officer wrote. He also found a cookie sheet covered with a pound of bacon sitting on top of the stove. 'I observed the burner to be on the setting \\"High\\" and the bacon to be severely burned and smoking badly,' the officer wrote. Mother: Crispi, who as allegedly drunk when she was arrested at her ex's home, is pictured with her son. Together: Crispi is pictured last November with a man she calls 'the love of my life'. The ex she allegedly targeted in the arson attempt has not been identified by police. The officer stopped the fire and arrested Crispi. A test found that she had a blood-alcohol content of 0.346 and she was taken to the hospital for a medical clearance before being booked into jail, the charging documents state. 'The doctor asked her about the fireâ€¦ and she stated she was attempting to start a fire in the house to get back at (her ex-boyfriend),' the charges state. Crispi is also charged with burglary, assault by a prisoner, interfering with an arresting officer, electronic communication harassment and intoxication. She is due in court on April 14.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

News article: Halfway through a long lunch at Tavern on the Green on a sunny September day, the trim, tanned filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson, dressed in a Southern California beach bum’s uniform — Quiksilver shorts, faded blue T-shirt, crumpled white bucket hat — went silent. Mr. Anderson, 44, had been asked a simple question: Does Thomas Pynchon, the reclusive author of “Gravity’s Rainbow,” “Mason & Dixon” and “The Crying of Lot 49,” make an on-screen cameo in Mr. Anderson’s “Inherent Vice,” the first movie adapted from one of the writer’s celebrated novels? A cameo seems like the kind of sly prank that might amuse Mr. Pynchon, who has seemed to love hiding in plain sight since his spectacular rise to literary fame began with his 1963 novel, “V.” In 2004, he “appeared” in two throwaway bits on “The Simpsons,” and even then wore an animated bag over his presumably oversized and yellow head as he shouted, “Get your picture taken with a reclusive author!” In 2009, Mr. Pynchon narrated an online trailer for “Inherent Vice.” And his novels are littered with an obsessive cineaste’s catalog of obscure references. A cameo would also be in keeping with the mischievous tone of Mr. Anderson’s madcap adaptation, which will have its premiere as the centerpiece of the New York Film Festival next Saturday, and open in theaters Dec. 12. A 180-degree turn from Mr. Anderson’s relentless oil odyssey “There Will Be Blood,” “Inherent Vice” is his most comedic and anarchic film since “Boogie Nights.” It’s a stoner detective film so overstuffed with visual gags and gimmicks that the filmmaker said he was inspired by slapstick spoofs like “Top Secret!” and “Airplane!” ||||| John Oliver Takes a Good Look at the Bad Apples Working in Police Forces Watch the videos for \\"Don't Touch My Hair\\" and \\"Cranes in the Sky.\\" Solange Knowles Dropped Two New Music Videos From A Seat at The Table 12:29 a.m. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Trailer Stars Ghost Pirates and a Drawing of Johnny Depp The ghosts (and viewers) will have to wait until another trailer to find Jack Sparrow. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Oh, you're inquiring about that quite long piece of news, right?

Zane reports this to his supervisor, Phil Gordian (Ron Silver) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, but Phil dismisses the claims. Zane soon finds that he has been fired because of supposed budget cuts, and blacklisted, preventing him from working at other telescopes. Taking a job as a television satellite installer, he creates his own telescope array using his customers' dishes in the neighborhood, operating it secretly from his attic with help of his young next door neighbor, Kiki.Zane relocates the signal, but it is drowned out by a terrestrial signal from a Mexican radio station.

Anson kicked the cat How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"The linguistic integrity of the sentence, \\"Anson kicked the cat,\\" can be analyzed by examining several components, including syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. In a nutshell, linguistic integrity refers to the coherence, logical structure, and meaningfulness of a sentence. In the case of the given sentence, we will break down these aspects to examine its linguistic integrity properly. 1. Syntax: Syntax is the arrangement of words and phrases, according to the rules of a language, to form well-structured sentences. In the given sentence, the word order follows the standard English subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern, with \\"Anson\\" as the subject, \\"kicked\\" as the verb, and \\"the cat\\" as the object. This sentence adheres to the syntactic rules of English grammar, making it a structurally sound and intelligible sentence. 2. Semantics: Semantics pertains to the meaning of words and phrases within a certain context. In this sentence, the semantics can be considered clear and straightforward. Each word is appropriate and conveys a specific meaning without ambiguity. The subject \\"Anson\\" refers to a person, the verb \\"kicked\\" denotes an action with a clear physical implication, and \\"the cat\\" clearly defines the object receiving the action. The sentence also employs an article \\"the\\" to specify a particular cat, further clarifying the meaning. As there is no lexical ambiguity or confusion, we can conclude that the sentence has a high level of semantic integrity. 3. Pragmatics: This aspect considers the contextual meaning and usage of a sentence in a communicative and social context. From a pragmatic perspective, the sentence is relatively clear and straightforward. It provides vital information about an action (kicking) performed by a specific person (Anson) on a specific object (the cat). However, the context behind this action remains unclear. For instance, we do not know why Anson kicked the cat, whether it was accidental or intentional, or even the consequences of this action. To gauge the pragmatic integrity, it is essential to recognize the intent behind the given statement. Is the speaker merely sharing this piece of information or trying to evoke a certain reaction or emotion? Without more context, it is difficult to determine the pragmatic effectiveness of the sentence fully. In conclusion, \\"Anson kicked the cat\\" can be considered a syntactically and semantically coherent sentence due to its adherence to word order rules and avoiding lexical ambiguity. However, its pragmatic integrity can only be effectively assessed with more contextual information. Despite the lack of context, the sentence still delivers a clear, basic message about an action carried out by a subject on an object, demonstrating a reasonable level of linguistic integrity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Sliced Apples Give the Apple Industry a Sales Boost Apple consumption is going up thanks to an unbelievably simple fix. It doesn’t take a group of researchers to figure out that kids prefer slices to whole apples, though it does take a group of researchers to calculate just how much they prefer them. The Washington Post reports that two studies found that apple consumption increased substantially when the fruit was served to school kids pre-sliced. One study conducted in eight schools found that consumption increased by over 60% when apples were served sliced. A follow-up study looking at six schools found similar results, as apple consumption grew by 70%. In 2014 Americans ate 511 million fresh sliced apples, a growth of about 350% from a decade earlier. Between 2010 and 2013, overall apple consumption grew by 13%; in 2013 Americans ate 17.5 pounds of apples per capita, the highest consumption had been in nearly 10 years. “Sliced apples just make a lot more sense for kids,” study author and behavioral economics professor David Just told the Post. It may seem silly to think of eating an apple in its natural, whole form as inconvenient. But for kids with missing teeth or braces, it is. “It’s one of those circumstances where what seems like a really small inconvenience actually makes a huge difference,” Just added. The USDA even recommends that fruit be served in “age-appropriate pieces.” McDonald’s noticed the convenience of pre-sliced apples earlier than most, and began selling them in 2004. Mark Seetin, director of regulatory and industry affairs for the U.S. Apple Association said that while school lunches were a “significant contributor” to increased consumption, “When a company as big as McDonald’s helps promote something, it not only boosts sales, but also really raises public awareness.” However, we also have to consider the potential environmental impact of pre-packaged apple slices. It helps reduce food waste, because less apples are thrown away, but slices tend to be served in plastic bags, increasing plastic waste—something that Whole Foods wfm was criticized for not too long ago. Sliced apples still only account for about 5% of all apple sales, though many expect that number will soon increase. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The news article highlights the significant increase in apple consumption in schools and the overall apple industry due to a simple fix: serving apples pre-sliced. According to two studies, apple consumption in schools increased by 60-70% when apples were served sliced. This is mainly because it is more convenient for children, especially those with missing teeth or braces. In 2014, Americans consumed 511 million fresh sliced apples, showing a growth of about 350% from a decade earlier. Between 2010 and 2013, overall apple consumption increased by 13%. The inclusion of sliced apples in school lunches and fast-food chains like McDonald's has contributed to the increased consumption and raised public awareness. However, the article also points out the potential environmental impact due to the increased use of plastic packaging for pre-sliced apples. On one hand, it helps reduce food waste as fewer apples are thrown away, but on the other hand, the use of plastic bags for packaging contributes to plastic waste. Despite the concerns, sliced apples account for only about 5% of all apple sales, and it is expected that this number will increase in the near future. Some key takeaways from the article include the positive impact of pre-sliced apples on apple consumption, the role of convenience in influencing children's food choices, and the need to balance the benefits with the potential environmental impact of packaging."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: The Armed Forces' 115,349 personnel are divided into a hierarchy of numerous ranks of officers and non-commissioned members. The governor general appoints, on the advice of the prime minister, the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) as the highest ranking commissioned officer in the Armed Forces and who, as head of the Armed Forces Council, is in command of the Canadian Forces. The Armed Forces Council generally operates from National Defence Headquarters (NDHQ) in Ottawa, Ontario. On the Armed Forces Council sit the heads of Canadian Joint Operations Command and Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, and the heads of the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Army, the Royal Canadian Air Force and other key Level 1 organizations. The sovereign and most other members of the Canadian Royal Family also act as colonels-in-chief, honorary air commodores, air commodores-in-chief, admirals, and captains-general of Canadian Forces units, though these positions are ceremonial. What is the answer to this question: What are some of the members of the Armed Forces Council?","completion":"The Armed Forces Council is a high-level military body in Canada that is responsible for overseeing the Canadian Armed Forces. Some of the key members of the Armed Forces Council include: 1. Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS): Appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister, the CDS serves as the highest-ranking commissioned officer in the Canadian Armed Forces and is the head of the Armed Forces Council, holding overall command of the Canadian Forces. 2. Vice Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS): Assisting the CDS, the VCDS holds a crucial position within the Armed Forces Council. The VCDS is responsible for managing the general administration and coordination of the Canadian Forces and the Department of National Defence’s resources. 3. Commander of the Canadian Joint Operations Command (CJOC): As a key member of the Armed Forces Council, the Commander of CJOC oversees all the military operations involving the Canadian Armed Forces around the world. The CJOC ensures operational readiness and the successful execution of national and international military missions. 4. Commander of the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM): Responsible for special operations forces within the Canadian Armed Forces, the Commander of CANSOFCOM is another key member of the Armed Forces Council. CANSOFCOM carries out specialized and often covert missions and provides rapid response capabilities to the Canadian government. 5. Commander of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN): As the head of the Canadian Navy, the Commander of the RCN leads and directs naval operations and is responsible for maintaining maritime security and defence objectives for Canada. The Commander of the RCN is also a member of the Armed Forces Council. 6. Commander of the Canadian Army: Responsible for leading Canada's land forces, the Commander of the Canadian Army plays a critical role in the overall operations of the Canadian Armed Forces and participates as a member of the Armed Forces Council. 7. Commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF): The Commander of the RCAF leads the air component of Canada's military, and is responsible for the planning, coordination, and execution of air force operations. The RCAF Commander sits as a member of the Armed Forces Council. In addition to these key members, other leaders of Level 1 organizations within the Canadian Forces may participate in the Armed Forces Council.

In the US alone, every year or two brings the discovery of mammoth bones uncovered by the construction of a subway, stadium, or parking lot. They don't stay mysteries for long. But imagine it's 100 or 200 or 500 years ago, and you've just discovered the fossilized bones of a humongous creature with a 10-foot skull. What would you think it was? A human giant from biblical times? You might. Or perhaps you'd look at the gaping hole in the front of the skull and think: Eek, Cyclops! Or a unicorn. Or, if you're extra-creative, a sea monster that somehow ended up on land (double eek!). In his new book Discovering the Mammoth: A Tale of Giants, Unicorns, Ivory, and the Birth of a New Science, technical writer and self-described mammoth enthusiast John McKay digs deep into human history to explore how we tackled the perplexing mystery of these extraordinary fossils. \\"Everybody has their own way of looking at the world,\\" McKay says, \\"but almost everywhere, people had no problem believing these were real animals or monsters that once lived.\\" In an interview with the Monitor, McKay talks about the evolving fossil theories, the challenges that the bones posed to faith, and what this all says about the human drive to understand. Q: So what was a woolly mammoth? A kind of prehistoric giant hairy elephant? That's pretty much what it is. They're related to elephants, part of a big and complex family tree. As they moved into colder areas, they got progressively stockier and hairier. They were still running around after the pyramids were built, and the final ones to go extinct were on an island north of Siberia. They seem to have mostly died from inbreeding. They were terribly inbred and started to develop genetic problems. Q: How did people come to think these bones were of giant humans? They're trying to make sense of something that has no analog in the world around them because they hadn't seen elephants yet. They'd know what the typical big animals in their area are like, and they'd notice that these aren't like any of the animals they hunt or see. They'd find a femur or a thigh bone and start laying the bones out: Here's the legs, the hips, the ribs and 5-fingered feet that look like human hands. They'd put it all together and make it into a human. Q: Sometimes they'd assume these were giant humans from the bible. But they'd also come up with out-there ideas like the Cyclops. How did they figure that? If you look at an elephant's skull, there's this giant opening in the front for the trunk. It looks like a giant eyehole, so they developed the Cyclops idea. And the tusks looked like fangs, perfect for a monster. Q: How did some Europeans figure that the bones weren't from actual animals? Some people in the medieval and early modern periods thought these were just rocks that resembled bones. There was a little bit of mysticism mixed in it too, the belief that there were forces within the earth that could cause something to take on the appearance of something else. Q: How did the sea monster theory develop? There was a belief that for every animal on the land, there was an equivalent animal in the sea: There were sea cows, sea horses, sea dogs. Q: How did mammoth fossils challenge religion? There was an idea that goes all the way back to Aristotle of the sacred chain of being: Everything in God's creation is neatly ranked, there's a place for everything, everything is in its place, because God is perfect. Whatever God creates will also be perfect because there's no room for superfluous parts. Extinction would be somewhat sacrilegious, almost heretical. God didn't make things without a purpose. Thanks to the fossils, people also came to the conclusion that the past had taken more time than the standard biblical chronology. There needed to be more time for all of these things to happen. That made a lot of religious authorities uncomfortable. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

State media are reporting that the massive haul came from Russia and was seized in north-east China in February. The largest piece of mammoth ivory seized was more than 1.6m (5ft) long, a customs officer was quoted as saying. There is no international ban on the trade but Chinese officials said the haul was not declared. Millions of mammoths The stockpile is part of a booming trade between Russia and China in ivory taken from the skeletons of mammoths found in the Siberian tundra. The effects of global warming in the Arctic has made it easier to collect tusks preserved in ice for thousands of years, researchers say. More than 100 woolly mammoth tusks were seized at the port of Luobei in Heilongjiang province, in addition to 37 woolly rhino horn parts and more than a tonne of jade. They were hidden in concealed compartments in a truck, according to reports. Image copyright China News Service Image caption The tusks were seized in February but were shown to media earlier this week The truck driver is alleged to have claimed he was only carrying soybeans, and to have fled the scene when the truck was inspected. He and another person were later arrested. Listen: The growing and legal trade in mammoth ivory (BBC Radio 4) DNA clues to why woolly mammoth died out There are estimated to be around 10 million mammoths that \\"remain incarcerated within the permafrost of the Arctic tundra\\", according to Douglas MacMillan, a professor of conservation and applied resource economics at the University of Kent. Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Most of the world's woolly mammoths had died out by about 10,500 years ago Some mammoth experts have suggested that the trade in mammoth ivory should be banned, even though the animals are extinct. They argue that their tusks are often sold as elephant tusks, and thus encourage overall demand for ivory. It is estimated that more than 50% of the ivory sold into China, which has has the biggest ivory market in the world, is mammoth ivory. Hong Kong is a major destination, and the ivory is used to make jewellery and other objects, including ornamental tusks. But other experts like Prof MacMillan say that a ban would not halt the trade but rather \\"drive it underground and attract the attention of organised crime groups\\". Most of the world's woolly mammoths had died out by about 10,500 years ago. Scientists believe that human hunting and environmental changes played a role in their extinction. China has announced a ban on all elephant ivory trade and processing activities by the end of 2017. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Humans have been trying to make sense of woolly mammoth fossils for centuries, thinking their bones belonged to giant humans, biblical mythical creatures, sea monsters and more, according to a new book by mammoth enthusiast John McKay.

Here is a more detailed analysis of the phrase: 1. The phrase starts by mentioning that the person is \\"considered a star.\\" This is a somewhat neutral statement, as it simply describes the person's status in society or within a specific context. However, it can be regarded as slightly positive, since being considered a star often implies success and popularity. 2. The phrase takes a turn with the use of the word \\"nor,\\" which is a conjunction that introduces a negative element to the following part of the sentence. This creates a juxtaposition in the sentence, contrasting the positive view of the person being a star against the negative points that come next. 3. The following part of the phrase, \\"why he keeps being cast in action films,\\" indicates the writer's confusion over the person's recurring appearances in such films. This statement could be interpreted as neutral if no negative connotation were attached to it; however, the previous use of \\"nor\\" warns the reader that this question is part of a negative thought. 4. The phrase ends with a strong negative assertion: \\"when none of them are ever any good.\\" Here, the writer directly states that the action films the person is cast in are never good, which sharply criticizes both the quality of the films and the person's suitability or contribution to those films. This part of the sentence showcases that the overall sentiment towards the person and the action films he stars in is negative. So, when analyzing the whole phrase, it can be determined that it carries a predominantly negative sentiment, with a hint of a positive aspect at the beginning. However, the negative aspects of the statement—being critical of the person's casting choices and the quality of their associated films—far outweigh the positive notion of being a star."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which process would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, process A or process B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Process B. To understand why process B causes more oxygen and glucose to be sent to the muscles, it is crucial to know the hormones produced and functions of the adrenal glands' cortex and medulla. The adrenal glands have two distinct parts: the outer cortex and the inner medulla. Each of them has a unique function, secreting different hormones that play vital roles in the body. Process A: Hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex The adrenal cortex is primarily responsible for producing corticosteroids - hormones that regulate metabolism, immune response, and other essential functions. There are two main types of hormones produced by the adrenal cortex: 1. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, have a wide range of effects, including regulating glucose metabolism, suppressing the immune system, and helping the body respond to stress. 2. Mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, help maintain the balance of sodium and potassium in the body and regulate blood pressure. These hormones play essential roles in maintaining homeostasis, but they do not directly cause an increase in the supply of oxygen and glucose to the muscles in significant amounts. Process B: Hormones secreted by the adrenal medulla The adrenal medulla is part of the sympathetic nervous system and produces catecholamines – the most important of which are adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). During times of stress or perceived danger, the adrenal medulla releases these hormones into the bloodstream. These hormones have a direct impact on the \\"fight or flight\\" response, preparing the body for immediate action. The release of catecholamines triggers a series of physiological changes, including: 1. Increased heart rate and stronger contractions, which in turn result in increased blood flow. The increased circulation brings more oxygen and nutrients (including glucose) to the muscles, supplying them with the energy needed for intense physical activity. 2. Enhanced lung function, widening the airways, allowing for more oxygen to be taken in and transported to the muscles. 3. Mobilization of glucose and fatty acids from storage sites, increasing the availability of these fuel sources for muscles and other organs. In conclusion, process B, which involves the secretion of hormones from the adrenal medulla, directly leads to an increase in both oxygen and glucose availability to the muscles. This occurs as part of the body's \\"fight or flight\\" response, as the body is prepared to either confront or flee from potential danger. By contrast, process A (secretion of hormones from the adrenal cortex) is mainly involved in maintaining homeostasis and does not have the same direct effect on oxygen and glucose availability to the muscles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Time and again ancient ‘bog bodies’, and their remarkably well-preserved features dating back thousands of years, have left scientists speechless. These eerie cadavers are naturally mummified within a peat bog that preserves intricate details, such forehead creases and even laughter lines. Now, the incredible properties of peat are being used by the beauty industry to create skincare products that claim to promote youth and cure skin damage. Scroll down for video. Bill Kenny from Croghan Hill was inspired to launch the the peat-based Ógra skincare range after seeing the well-preserved Iron Age body of 'Old Croghan Man' (pictured) found in a bog in 2003. One such company is Tullamore-based Ógra who is using peat to create a range of luxury skincare products, according to a report by Audrey McGlinchy in Narratively. The Irish group has made use of local peat, which is the material formed when plant remains partially decompose. This particular peat in County Offaly has one of the highest concentration of antioxidants in the world. Bogs, which are particularly common in Ireland, contain this peat which as the bog grows, gets pushed deeper beneath the surface. Bogs, which are particularly common in Ireland, contain peat which as the bog grows, gets pushed deeper beneath the surface. Inspired by peat's protective powers, Mr Kenny started Ógra - the Irish word for ‘youth’. The company now sells peat-based skincare products such as the Peat Face and Body Mask for £40 (66) Away from oxygen, the bacteria that break down matter can’t survive, which means the deeper you dig in a bog, the greater peat’s youthful power. Bill Kenny, founder of Ógra, lives just few miles away from a 14-acre bog near Croghan Hill in which the Iron Age ‘Old Croghan Man’ was discovered in 2003. Promotes youthfulness – According to Ogra, the skincare company, peat contains strong antioxidants that can combat free radical damage. This free radical damage is generally recognised as the main cause of premature ageing. Peat contains trace elements including zinc, copper, iron, selenium as well as partially rotted plants such as bog whortleberry. It is also alleged to promote an increase in collagen production which helps to increase cell regeneration and slow down the ageing process. Astringency – It claims to tighten the pores which gives the skin a smoother look. Detoxifier – The company claim that peat stimulates the lymphatic system and is therefore a very effective detoxifier. Peat removes dead skin cells, toxins and other impurities from your skin. PH balance - The natural abundance of essential oils and fatty acids penetrate into the skin and are thought to to re-establish the skin’s natural PH balance. Source: Ogra Skincare. ‘I remember the police superintendent phoning me up to tell me they’d found a body in the peat,’ the former construction worker told MailOnline. ‘I thought maybe it was a murder victim, but when I spoke to the superintendent that evening he told me the man was there for thousands of years. ‘He was so well-preserved, they could tell you what he ate the day he died, and by the pollen in his nostrils, what time of year he died.’ Inspired by these protective powers, Mr Kenny started Ógra - the Irish word for ‘youth’. The company now sells peat-based skincare products such as the Peat Face and Body Mask for £40 (66). Last year, Ógra Skincare sent a batch of peat to Glasgow University to be dated and they found that Mr Kenny’s bog is more than 9,000 years old. The peat, they discovered, contained 98 to 99 per cent organic materials, including high levels of antioxidants and antiseptics. The main antioxidant is trolox, the water-soluble equivalent of vitamin E. The product also contains magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, copper, iron and zinc. Recalling his earliest memory of peat, Mr Kenny is still amazed by it ‘magical properties’. ‘When I was seven, my hand was badly burnt by a pot of water,’ he told MailOnline. ‘I got up and all the skin on my hand fell, it was red raw, just like a piece of liver. ‘My mother put me on a bicycle and took me to a peat bog that we own just a mile away. She mixed up the peat and she put my hand straight down into it. ‘The only thing I can remember about that, is that once I entered my hand into the peat there was no more pain… I thought, there must be something fabulous in peat.’ Bill Kenny, founder of Ógra, lives just few miles away from a fourteen-acre bog near Croghan Hill in which the Iron Age ‘Old Croghan Man’ was discovered.

According to a close friend, he and Crazy Horse \\"were both born in the same year at the same season of the year,\\" which census records and other interviews place in 1842. Encouraging Bear, an Oglala medicine man and spiritual adviser to the Oglala war leader, reported that Crazy Horse was born \\"in the year in which the band to which he belonged, the Oglala, stole One Hundred Horses, and in the fall of the year,\\" a reference to the annual Lakota calendar or winter count. Among the Oglala winter counts, the stealing of 100 horses is noted by Cloud Shield, and possibly by American Horse and Red Horse owner, as equivalent to the year 1840-41. In the fall of 1870, Crazy Horse invited Black Buffalo Woman to accompany him on a buffalo hunt in the Slim Buttes area of present-day northwestern South Dakota. She was the wife of No Water, who had a reputation for drinking too much. It was Lakota custom to allow a woman to divorce her husband at any time. She did so by moving in with relatives or with another man, or by placing the husband's belongings outside their lodge. Although some compensation might be required to smooth over hurt feelings, the rejected husband was expected to accept his wife's decision. No Water was away from camp when Crazy Horse and Black Buffalo Woman left for the buffalo hunt. No Water tracked down Crazy Horse and Black Buffalo Woman in the Slim Buttes area. When he found them in a teepee, he called Crazy Horse's name from outside. When Crazy Horse answered, No Water stuck a pistol into the teepee and aimed for Crazy Horse. Touch the Clouds, Crazy Horse's first cousin and son of Lone Horn, was sitting in the teepee nearest the entry. He knocked the pistol upward as No Water fired, deflecting the bullet to Crazy Horse's upper jaw. No Water left, with Crazy Horse's relatives in hot pursuit. No Water ran his horse until it died and continued on foot until he reached the safety of his own village. Several elders convinced Crazy Horse and No Water that no more blood should be shed. As compensation for the shooting, No Water gave Crazy Horse three horses. Because Crazy Horse was with a married man's wife, he was stripped of his title as Shirt Wearer (leader).","completion":"This text is about Crazy Horse, a Native American war leader of the Oglala Lakota tribe. Crazy Horse was born between 1840 and 1845, and he played a significant role in the resistance against the United States government's efforts to force the Sioux people onto reservations during the late 1800s. The text mentions a specific incident involving Crazy Horse, Black Buffalo Woman, and No Water. Black Buffalo Woman was married to No Water, but according to the Lakota custom, she had the right to divorce her husband at any time. She decided to leave him and join Crazy Horse for a buffalo hunt in the Slim Buttes area of present-day northwestern South Dakota. No Water, upset by his wife’s decision, tracked them down and shot Crazy Horse in the face, aiming for his upper jaw. However, Touch the Clouds, Crazy Horse's first cousin, intervened and deflected the bullet. After the shooting, the elders from both Crazy Horse's and No Water's villages intervened and convinced them not to continue the violence. No Water compensated Crazy Horse for the aggression by giving him three horses. As a result of this incident, Crazy Horse was stripped of his title as Shirt Wearer (leader) because he was with a married woman. Crazy Horse is known for his bravery and prowess in battle, as well as his dedication to the preservation of the Lakota way of life.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - She has recorded with Yellow Magic Orchestra and its members Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, as well as with Swing Out Sister, Pat Metheny, The Chieftains, Lyle Mays, members of Little Feat, David Sylvian, Mick Karn, Kenji Omura, Gil Goldstein, Toninho Horta, Mino Cinelu, Jeff Bova, Charlie Haden, Peter Erskine, Anthony Jackson, David Rhodes, Bill Frisell, Thomas Dolby, the band Quruli, Rei Harakami as yanokami and her daughter Miu Sakamoto. - Biography.

If \\"Two people are watching a basketball game on a flat screen television.\\", does this mean that \\"Two people are watching a baseball game.\\"?","completion":"No, this statement does not mean that \\"Two people are watching a baseball game.\\" The initial premise given is that \\"Two people are watching a basketball game on a flat screen television.\\" Based on this information, we can only conclude that the two individuals are engaged in watching a basketball game, not a baseball game. Basketball and baseball are two distinct sports. While both are popular team sports in various parts of the world, they are fundamentally different in rules, gameplay, and objectives. Basketball is played on a rectangular court, typically indoors, with two teams consisting of five players each. Both teams attempt to score points by passing the ball through the opponent's hoop while also trying to prevent the opposing team from scoring. The team with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner. On the other hand, baseball is a sport typically played outdoors in a baseball field, also known as a diamond. The game involves two teams consisting of nine players each, who alternate between playing offense (batting) and defense (fielding). The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a thrown ball with a bat and then running around a series of bases, completing a circuit of four bases to score a run. The team that scores the most runs by the end of nine innings is considered the winner. Considering these differences in sports, the statement \\"Two people are watching a basketball game on a flat screen television.\\" cannot be equated to them watching a baseball game. The focus remains solely on their engagement with a basketball game, and it does not provide any information about them also watching or having any interest in a baseball game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She engages him in idle chatter as she writes invitations for an elaborate party she is giving That evening. the Pendertons entertain the Langdons.

Alison, who suffers through the evening's by-play, has been ill since the death, three years prior, of her malormed baby.

Based on a survey of 8,000 teachers and a review of research, the report says drilling for tests has narrowed what children are learning. The government said it is determined to ensure every child is able to realise their potential. The report, Exam Factories? The Impact of Accountability Measures on Children and Young People, by Prof Merryn Hutchings of London Metropolitan University, says pupils' emotional health and wellbeing is suffering because of \\"high-stakes testing\\". These are the national tests, exams and progress measures which the government uses to hold schools to account. Most teachers surveyed for the report agreed pupils became \\"very stressed/anxious in the time leading up to Sats/public examinations\\". One teacher said: \\"You just see them sat there, a 10- or 11-year-old kid in complete meltdown.\\" Another said: \\"I have just had a child off school for three days because he was so worried about his recent test result and didn't want to take any more tests.\\" Lucie Russell, director of campaigns at mental health charity Young Minds, which backed the report, said: \\"Both pupils and teachers are under a lot of pressure to achieve results in a pressure cooker, exam factory environment. \\"Many of the young people Young Minds works with say that they feel completely defined by their grades and that this is very detrimental to their wellbeing and self-esteem.\\" According to the report, the tests affect both able and less able pupils similarly. One secondary school special-needs co-ordinator said: \\"The higher ability [pupils], and the ones with the very supportive or pushy parents, are receiving higher levels of stress because of how much is being expected of them. \\"I think the lower end or those with maybe less supportive parents as well are suffering from the fact that they are not being given a curriculum that suits them.\\" The report also argued the focus on testing was harming pupil-teacher relationships, with teachers less able to view pupils in the round. One junior school teacher said: \\"I am in danger of seeing them more in terms of what colour they are in my pupils' list eg are they red (below expectation), green (above expectation) or purples (Pupil Premium) - rather than as individuals.\\" Kevin Courtney, deputy general-secretary of the NUT, said: \\"Teachers at the sharp end are saying this loud and clear, 'If it isn't relevant to a test then it is not seen as a priority.' \\"The whole culture of a school has become geared towards meeting government targets and Ofsted expectations. As this report shows, schools are on the verge of becoming 'exam factories'.\\" He argued the accountability agenda was \\"damaging children's experience of education\\", which should be joyful and leave them with \\"a thirst for knowledge for the rest of their lives\\". A Department for Education spokesperson said: \\"Part of our commitment to social justice is the determination to ensure every child is given an education that allows them realise their potential. \\"That's why we are raising standards with a rigorous new curriculum, world class exams and new accountability system that rewards those schools which help every child to achieve their best.\\"","completion":"The National Union of Teachers' report highlights that students are developing stress-related conditions due to the increased focus on testing in schools. The study, based on a survey of 8,000 teachers and a review of research, states that drilling for tests has limited the scope of learning for children. The government, on the other hand, is committed to ensuring every child can realize their potential. The report, titled \\"Exam Factories?

They came together in a chance meeting on the way home from work. Next year the meeting will be in Chicago.","completion":"No, the word \\"meeting\\" in these two sentences has different meanings. In English, the term \\"meeting\\" can be used in various contexts, and in these particular sentences, it represents two distinct concepts. In the first sentence, \\"They came together in a chance meeting on the way home from work,\\" the meaning of \\"meeting\\" refers to an unplanned and unexpected encounter between two or more people. In this context, the emphasis is on the coincidental nature of the interaction, suggesting that the involved parties did not prearrange or intentionally plan to meet one another. The phrase \\"chance meeting\\" serves to emphasize the element of surprise and randomness in this encounter. In the second sentence, \\"Next year the meeting will be in Chicago,\\" the meaning of \\"meeting\\" refers to a prearranged and formal gathering of individuals, typically for a specific purpose, such as discussing business, exchanging ideas, or making decisions. The word \\"meeting\\" in this case often implies that the gathering is scheduled and organized, possibly involving a set agenda and a group of attendees who share common interests or objectives. This type of meeting can be held for various purposes, such as conferences, workshops, or seminars, and might involve presentations, collaborations, or networking. It is essential to acknowledge that English has many homographs like \\"meeting,\\" where a single word can have multiple meanings depending on the context in which it is used. These variations in meaning are crucial in understanding and interpreting the different situations and ideas conveyed by the sentences. So, although the word \\"meeting\\" appears in both sentences, it has a different connotation in each scenario, highlighting the diverse ways language can be used to express different concepts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Our goal was to evaluate the frequency of influenza vaccination among SOT recipients with influenza disease and its impact on the illness severity during the 2010-2011 season. Adult SOT recipients with confirmed influenza infection were included from December 2010 to April 2011. Follow-up data were recorded and antibody titres were determined using a microneutralization assay. Sixty-four SOT recipients were included in the study, ten (15.6%) with severe disease, requiring admission to intensive care units, of whom four (6.3%) died. In all, 34 (53.1%) received the 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine and 32 (50.0%) received the 2009-H1N1 pandemic vaccine, and none had detectable antibodies against influenza at the time of diagnosis of influenza infection. Twenty-three (67.6%) of the patients that received the vaccine required hospital admission and presented less dyspnoea (10, 29.4% versus 14 (50.0%), p 0.09) and pneumonia (8, 23.8% versus 15, 50.0%, p 0.03, relative risk 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9) than unvaccinated patients, with relative risk reductions of 60% and 70%, respectively. Although influenza vaccination confers protection on SOT recipients against developing influenza pneumonia, the rate of clinical failure is still high. New strategies to improve influenza immunization are needed for this group of patients.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who didn't finish the normal high magnification search before Waddle took the periscope? is inside the article: As Greeneville ascended to periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar displays and the fire control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing to suggest that the previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens. Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room. At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14. Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course. Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface). At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction. Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators. Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships. Waddle then took the periscope before Coen could complete the normal high magnification search.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: pick from the following. a). negative b). positive TEXT:2 stars for Kay Francis -- she's wonderful! And she didn't deserve this horrible tripe that Warner Bros. threw her way! The two-pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme. Kay is a small-town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a big-shot actor comes to town and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities, Kay tells her husband she's going to the movies. The hubby's biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby's ear that Kay's not being truthful, and he sets out looking for her. He finds her w/ the actor in the hotel (they are only talking!) and he slugs the guy, who falls over a railing, lands face-first in a pond (lake?), and dies. Now here's the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based: 1) the judge tells the jury that if it's determined that the man died *before* his head went into the water, that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder. (Whaaaaa?????? I think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most, not FIRST DEGREE murder. Give me a break! But the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life. Whatever.) 2) the hubby's lawyer, after the conviction and sentencing, tells Kay that it's all HER fault. His reasoning is that if she hadn't gone over to the actor's room, then her husband wouldn't have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him. He tells her that she's the guilty one, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the movie is all about Kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place. I can't even go on with this review. The movie was just all too painful. Four years earlier, in the pre-code days, you'd never have caught Kay playing such a wimp! In true Kay Francis fashion, though, she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character. I give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role. This character was a far cry from pre-code Kay roles and real-life spitfire Kay Francis. Steer way clear of this one! There are much better Kay Francis vehicles out there!

Does \\"draw\\" mean the same thing in these two sentences? Draw parallels.

The term \\"draw\\" has different meanings depending on its context, and in these two sentences it's being used to convey two different ideas. In the first sentence - Draw parallels - \\"draw\\" refers to identifying or finding similarities or connections between two or more things. Drawing parallels means comparing different subjects, situations, or objects and pointing out the ways in which they are alike. Here, \\"draw\\" serves as a metaphor, suggesting that the one who is \\"drawing\\" is bringing forth these connections and analogies like an artist creating lines on a canvas. In the second sentence - He drew an elaborate plan of attack - \\"draw\\" is being used to convey the idea of creating or designing something, which in this case is a plan. The act of drawing here refers to coming up with a detailed strategy or layout, possibly involving sketching or mapping out the plan visually. This sense of \\"draw\\" is more literal, as it implies the process of physically putting pen to paper to create a visual representation of the idea. While both uses of \\"draw\\" invoke the concept of the creation process, they denote different kinds of creative activity: one is centered around finding similarities and making comparisons (as in drawing parallels), while the other focuses on designing, outlining, or schematically representing ideas (as in drawing a plan)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Quite the opposite, the paragraph posits that one key factor in relieving pressure on armed forces is running a foreign policy that recognizes that America is at its strongest when it works with real alliances and shares the burdens of the world through high-level statesmanship and diplomacy to bring other nations to its side. The paragraph essentially emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and collaboration in foreign policy decisions, rather than advocating for isolationism or an overly aggressive stance. The idea presented is that America's strength lies in its ability to forge and maintain strong relationships with other nations, working together to address global challenges and alleviate the stress placed on its military. This belief in the power of alliances and diplomacy can be historically supported by the fact that some of America's most significant international accomplishments have been achieved through the cooperation with other nations, such as the establishment of the United Nations, NATO, and other international agreements and treaties. It is important to understand that the paragraph does not explicitly claim that America is weaker when not pursuing diplomacy and alliances; rather, it highlights the positive outcomes of a collaborative approach to foreign policy. The argument being made is that by fostering strong alliances, working through diplomacy, and sharing global responsibilities, America can make itself even stronger and more effective on the world stage."},{"prompt":"Title: I couldnt even finish this one.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: After commuting, cooking dinner and doing household chores, the average parent has just 30 minutes to devote to their children in the evenings, according to a new study. One in four working parents worry that half an hour simply isn't enough, while almost half fret that they aren't a good enough parent during the week. However, parenting experts believe just 12 minutes a day may be enough for mothers and fathers to fully _ with their child -- as long as they ask the right questions. Child psychologist Dr Claire Halsey said asking a series of open-ended questions can help improve parents' relationship with their children. Among the questions recommended in the research are: \\"How many times have you smiled today -- what made you laugh?\\"; \\"Can you act out what you did at breaktime?\\"; \\"Who is taller -- mummy or your teacher?\\" and \\"What are the names of the toys you played with today?\\" Parents of older children are advised to start up a conversation with: \\"I've got a great story for you but I want one in return... you first!\\" or \\"Tell me some school gossip ... _ !\\" Dr Halsey, working with the makers of Ribena Plus, who commissioned the research, said: \\"There is no one as tough on their own parenting skills as a parent -- but this study shows there is no need for parents to be so harsh. It's hard for working parents to juggle all their responsibilities and it can feel like guilt is simply a parent's lot -- but it's absolutely not.

Article: When we give our kids holiday gifts, many of us can't wait to hear their appreciative cries of\\"thank you!\\"once the wrapping gets ripped off. But here's a tip: You'd be wise not to expect much gratitude from them for what they receive. Gratitude can make us happier, healthier, and even fitter. But do the kids show their gratitude for the stuff we buy them? All the research I've done has convinced me that it won't happen. One mom told me that when she asked her 16-year-old son to thank her for buying him a cellphone, he said, \\"But that's what moms should do.\\" From a teenager's angle, it's a parent's responsibility to take care of the family. According to Dunham, Yale's assistant professor of psychology, \\"When teenagers code it that way, a gift is no longer something given freely and voluntarily\\"--it's just mom and dad living up to their obligation. Parents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view. Show by example that gratitude isn't aboutstuff--which ultimately can't make any of us happy anyway.It's about realizing how lucky you are and paying your good fortune forward. You can collect all the charitable appeals and sit down together with the kids to go through them. You set the budget for giving and the kids decide how it's distributed. Once the conversation about gratitude gets started, it's much easier to continue all year. Also you can set up a family routine at bedtime where kids describe three things that have made them grateful.

Hypothesis: A man is buying steel. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. The premise simply states that there's a man in a white shirt and hard hat working with steel, which could entail a variety of actions or tasks related to steel. This information alone does not help us determine whether he is buying steel or not. Working with steel can involve several tasks or roles, such as manufacturing, fabricating, welding, constructing, designing, inspecting, or even selling steel. Thus, it is important to analyze each aspect and possibility within the premise. Firstly, the man's attire and hard hat suggest that he is engaged in a construction or industrial setting; this means that he is likely working on-site, following safety protocols, and adhering to occupational standards. Wearing a hard hat indicates a potentially hazardous work environment, and is common within construction, engineering, and manufacturing industries. The white shirt may represent his role within the organization or simply be a choice of clothing for visibility and comfort. Secondly, the description primarily highlights the man's interaction with steel. Steel is a versatile and widely-used material found in numerous industries and applications. In construction, it serves as a critical component for building structures, reinforcing concrete, or manufacturing large-scale infrastructures like bridges or skyscrapers. Within manufacturing, steel is routinely utilized to produce various industrial products, tools, home appliances, and automotive parts. In all of these scenarios, the man could be actively working with steel but may not necessarily be purchasing it. Given the possibilities mentioned above – including potential roles in manufacturing, fabrication, construction, or inspection – we cannot confidently infer that the man is buying steel from the premise alone. There is insufficient evidence to establish a direct connection between the man's actions and purchasing steel. It is essential to consider other explanations or explore additional context and information to understand the relationship between the premise and hypothesis fully. In conclusion, while the premise provides a snapshot of the man dressed appropriately in a specific work setting and interacting with steel, it does not offer enough evidence to substantiate the hypothesis that he is buying steel. This highlights the importance of not jumping to conclusions based on incomplete or vague information and considering alternative interpretations when evaluating claims or observations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Google Takes On China BURLINGAME, Calif. -- Google took an exceptionally hard line against China late Tuesday, naming it as the source of a large-scale cyber attack last month, aimed at breaching the security of Google and some 20 other companies. The attack and other \\"attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the Web,\\" Google said, \\"have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China.\\" There was no underplaying the move by Google ( GOOG - news - people ), which like many U.S. companies has been circumspect about offending the Chinese government. The news appeared on two different Google blogs, with several members of Google's public affairs staff flagging the announcement in other venues. The main statement was signed by David Drummond, Google's top lawyer. Drummond wrote that in mid-December Google had detected a major attack on its infrastructure originating from China. On investigation, Drummond's post said, \\"we have discovered that at least 20 other large companies from a wide range of businesses--including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors--have been similarly targeted.\\" Google did not identify the companies, but said it is notifying them of the attack. The aim of this attack, and other breaches it has uncovered, was to access e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights campaigners worldwide. Drummond's post strongly implied Google believes the attacks were linked to the Chinese government itself. However, a Google spokesperson said that the companys investigation couldnt determine whether the hackers who had accessed Googles network were state-sponsored. Drummond referred in his post to Ghostnet, a Chinese surveillance system that was revealed to be monitoring companies and non-governmental organizations last March by the Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian group focused on Internet censorship and cyber warfare. But a Google spokesperson said that the connection between Ghostnet and the companys hacking incident wasnt definitive either. Ron Deibert, director of Citizen Lab and an author of that report, told Forbes that he had learned information about the attacks from Google that led him to believe they were perpetrated by different hackers from those participating in Ghostnet. The attackers' efforts, Google said, have been almost entirely unsuccessful. Google said it has made improvements to its computer architecture that will prevent further such attempts. But the tone and nature of its statement also showed that Google is hoping to use publicity to change Chinese behavior. \\"We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed,\\" Google said, \\"but also because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech.\\" Google said it is no longer willing to filter its search results in China to eliminate sites the government does not like. While it will try to work with the authorities to develop an acceptable unfiltered search engine, Google said, \\"we recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.\\" Google runs a distant second in China to Beijing-based Baidu, which has 60% of the Chinese search market, according to Analysys International. (See \\"The Man Who's Beating Google\\") The news last year that Google's head of China operations, Li Kaifu, was leaving the company sparked speculation that Google was set to abandon the country, however, it said in September that it would double its China-based staff. A Google spokesperson says Kaifu's departure wasnt related to the cybersecurity investigation. Though Google doesnt reveal how much of its revenue is drawn from China, investors seemed to think Tuesday's news would hurt. The companys stock fell 1.8% in after-hours trading. But Citizen Labs Ron Deibert argued that the move could help Google in the long term by bolstering the companys Do No Evil image and putting pressure on Yahoo! and Microsoft to follow in its footsteps. Google is making a principled decision that their services cant be compromised, says Deibert. This may be a shakeup that causes lots of companies to reflect on what they need to do to keep the Internet free and open. Google Bows To Chinese Writers Google's Nexus One: Winners And Losers What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about Google having problems with China. Google found out that China was trying to break into their computer systems and those of 20 other companies. This made Google think about whether it should keep doing business in China or not. Google also said it no longer wants to change its search results in China to remove things the Chinese government doesn't like. This might cause Google to have to close its website and offices in China. The story shows Google is worried about protecting people's right to speak freely on the internet and wants to make sure everyone knows what's happening."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: I was just out of college, only three days into a graduate year in England,and I was pulling a heavy bag and suitcase through the London Underground. I was also crying out of control. The day before yesterday, my uncle told me never to speak to him, his wife, or my two cousins again.Earlier, I made a joke. I didn't mean to hurt my aunt's feelings, but it did.I spent the evening in an ugly blue telephone booth . crying as I spoke to a family friend who lived in England. When I left the phone booth, I went back to a silent house with three closed bedroom doors. In the morning, I heard everyone get up and leave for work and school. I wrote a note to say sorry and pulled my bags to the train station. When I got into London, I had to take the underground to Angel Station to get to my family friend's house. I was familiar with the underground, but at the time, it was just endless white tiles .Coming to England seemed like a bad decision. Crying yet again, I tried to lift my suitcase up the stairs. When I was trying hard to walk forward, there were hands. Each time I faced another group of steps,a hand would lift the suitcase. At the top of the steps, the hand would let go, and I'd pull the suitcase to the next group. And just as I wanted to try again,another hand would appear. It happened several times. I never looked up, because I couldn't stop crying.Each hand looked different, and many different people helped me, without asking or saying anything. I couldn't look up. I wasn't able to say thank you. I went on to have an amazing year studying in England, but that was the last time I saw or spoke to any of my uncle's family.

Please answer this question: Sine, cosine and tangent are the three most familiar functions in which branch of mathematics?","completion":"Sine, cosine, and tangent are the three most familiar functions in the branch of mathematics known as trigonometry. Trigonometry is a division of mathematics that deals primarily with the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, specifically right-angled triangles. The word 'trigonometry' comes from the Greek words 'trigonon,' meaning \\"triangle,\\" and 'metron,' meaning \\"measure.\\" Therefore, trigonometry is essentially the study of measurements of triangles. In trigonometry, the sine (abbreviated as sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) functions are used to define and calculate the ratios between the lengths of the sides and angles of a right-angled triangle. These functions are fundamentally connected to the angles of a triangle, and they play a central role in solving various mathematical problems related to triangles. The sine, cosine, and tangent functions are defined as follows: 1. Sine Function (sin(θ)): The sine function represents the ratio between the length of the side opposite the angle θ (theta) and the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side of a right-angled triangle, opposite the right angle). Mathematically, sin(θ) = opposite side / hypotenuse. 2. Cosine Function (cos(θ)): The cosine function represents the ratio between the length of the adjacent side to the angle θ (theta) and the length of the hypotenuse. Mathematically, cos(θ) = adjacent side / hypotenuse. 3. Tangent Function (tan(θ)): The tangent function represents the ratio between the opposite side and the adjacent side to the angle θ (theta). Tangent can also be expressed as the ratio between sine and cosine functions, i.e., tan(θ) = sin(θ) / cos(θ). Trigonometry has applications in various areas, including geometry, calculus, physics, engineering, and even in the study of periodic phenomena in general. Its primary purpose is to establish relationships between angles and lengths of triangles, enabling us to solve real-world problems involving angles or distances that might otherwise be challenging to measure directly. For example, trigonometry helps us calculate the angles and distances in problems involving navigation and Astronomical studies, analyze wave patterns in sound and light, or determine the forces and stress in structures like bridges and buildings. Specifically, the sine, cosine, and tangent functions enable the calculation of unknown sides and angles of right-angled triangles, forming the basis for the solutions of these practical problems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who, along with his college, pioneered the study of Blakeney Point? ? In the decades preceding World War I, this stretch of coast became famous for its wildfowling; locals were looking for food, but some more affluent visitors hunted to collect rare birds; Norfolk's first barred warbler was shot on the point in 1884. In 1901, the Blakeney and Cley Wild Bird Protection Society created a bird sanctuary and appointed as its \\"watcher\\", Bob Pinchen, the first of only six men, up to 2012, to hold that post.In 1910, the owner of the Point, Augustus Cholmondeley Gough-Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe, leased the land to University College London (UCL), who also purchased the Old Lifeboat House at the end of the spit. When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility of development. In 1912, a public appeal initiated by Charles Rothschild and organised by UCL Professor Francis Wall Oliver and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust. UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913, where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point. The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre. Despite formal protection, the tern colony was not fenced off until the 1960s.The Point was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1954, along with the adjacent Cley Marshes reserve, and subsumed into the newly created 7,700-hectare (19,000-acre) North Norfolk Coast SSSI in 1986. The larger area is now additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, IUCN category IV (habitat/species management area) and is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Point became a National Nature Reserve (NNR) in 1994, and the coast from Holkham NNR to Salthouse, together with Scolt Head Island, became a Biosphere Reserve in 1976.","completion":"The first name of the person who, along with his college, pioneered the study of Blakeney Point is Francis.

When we subtract 44 from 48, it equals -92. Now, we have: -92s + 88s = -44. Now, let's add 88 to -92, that equals -4. So, our equation becomes: -4s = -44. Now, we want to find the value of \\"s\\".

He'd have to do what soon? - report for duty - wait for orders - fight for freedom - obay - receive orders The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer is \\"report for duty.\\" Step 1: Analyze the given options - report for duty: This implies that Brian has to present himself to his commanding officers and begin serving again. - wait for orders: This suggests that Brian has to wait for specific instructions after being called back. - fight for freedom: This refers to Brian needing to engage in combat for a specific cause, which may not necessarily happen immediately. - obey: This implies following orders, but it doesn't specify what action Brian needs to take. - receive orders: Similar to \\"wait for orders,\\" this suggests awaiting further instructions. Step 2: Consider the context Brian has just been called back to active service, which means he has been notified to resume his duties as a soldier. Step 3: Choose the best answer \\"Report for duty\\" is the most appropriate answer since it represents the immediate action Brian needs to take upon being called back to active service.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, \\"He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart.\\" When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place. It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from the wrong side of the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us. Their first gig was arranged by Matlock, who was studying at Saint Martins College. The band played at the school on 6 November 1975, in support of a pub rock group called Bazooka Joe, arranging to use their amps and drums. The Sex Pistols performed several cover songs, including the Who's \\"Substitute\\", the Small Faces' \\"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\\", and \\"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\\", made famous by the Monkees; according to observers, they were unexceptional musically aside from being extremely loud.

Background: Steven David \\"Steve\\" Levitt (born May 29, 1967) is an American economist known for his work in the field of crime, in particular on the link between legalized abortion and crime rates. Winner of the 2003 John Bates Clark Medal, he is currently the William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, director of the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He was co-editor of the Journal of Political Economy published by the University of Chicago Press until December 2007. With journalist Stephen J. Dubner, he co-authored the best-selling book Freakonomics (2005) and its sequels SuperFreakonomics (2009) Context: On April 10, 2006, John Lott filed suit for defamation against Steven Levitt and HarperCollins Publishers over the book Freakonomics and against Levitt over a series of emails to retired economist John B. McCall. In the book Freakonomics, Levitt and coauthor Stephen J. Dubner claimed that the results of Lott's research in More Guns, Less Crime had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of the Journal of Law and Economics had not been peer reviewed, alleged that Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue. A federal judge found that Levitt's replication claim in Freakonomics was not defamation but found merit in Lott's complaint over the email claims. Levitt settled the second defamation claim by admitting in a letter to John B. McCall that he himself was a peer reviewer in the 2001 issue of the Journal of Law and Economics, that Lott had not engaged in bribery (paying for extra costs of printing and postage for a conference issue is customary), and that he knew that \\"scholars with varying opinions\\" (including Levitt himself) had been invited to participate. The Chronicle of Higher Education characterized Levitt's letter as offering \\"a doozy of a concession.\\" The dismissal of the first half of Lott's suit was unanimously upheld by The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on February 11, 2009.

Everyone knows the special. relationship I have with this club and it has always felt like home to me. VIDEO Scroll down to see 'Cahill, Lampard and Mourinho gush over Drogba last season' Dotted line: The Ivorian striker completes his medical and puts pen to paper on a new one-year deal. Signed: Didier Drogba has signed a one-year deal withChelsea. New boy: Drogba returns to Chelsea after two years away from west London. 'My desire to win is still the same and I look forward to. the opportunity to help this team. I am excited for this next chapter of my. career.' Mourinho allayed fears Drogba would sully his impeccable. legacy at Chelsea, insisting that the Ivorian is still one of the best strikers. in world football. 'He’s coming because he’s one of the best strikers in. Europe. I know his personality very well and I know if he comes back he’s not. protected by history or what he’s done for this club previously,' Mourinho. said. 'Looks like Drogba is back, loved our battles best big game player I can remember.' 'He is coming with the mentality to make more history.' Drogba's arrival gives Mourinho's side moe firepower up. front. Despite marquee signing Diego Costa's arrival, Fernando Torres and. Romelu Lukaku have both been linked with moves away from the club. Drogba's last kick for Chelsea in his initial eight-year. spell was the winning penalty to hand the west Londoners the Champions League. trophy. Return: Didier Drogba returns to west London after spells in China and Turkey. One in one out: Drogba returns to Chelsea after two years away, just as Frank Lampard heads off to New York. High: Drogba left on a high after helping Chelsea become the first London team to win the Champions League. The striker had already equalised in extra-time against. Bayern Munich at their Allianz Arena. Mourinho has brought Drogba back into the fold at a time. when two stalwarts have left the club in Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole. 2004/05: Premier League and League Cup. 2005/06: Premier League. 2006/07: FA Cup and League Cup. 2008/09: FA Cup. 2009/10: Premier League and FA Cup. 2011/12: FA Cup and Champions League. Lampard has completed a move to new MLS side New York City. while Cole has moved to Roma. Fellow Blues legend Petr Cech has also been linked with a. move away with Thibaut Courtois returning from loan at Atletico Madrid. It means only John Terry remains from the spine of. Mourinho's original Chelsea side, which picked up back-to-back Premier League. titles in 2005 and 2006. Appearances: 341. Goals: 151. Goals per game: 0.44. Major trophies: 10. Drogba signed for Galatasaray in January 2013 after a short. spell at Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua after bowing out at the Blues. He had an emotional return to Stamford Bridge with the. Turkish side in last season's Champions League last-16 before leaving the club. this summer. Now Drogba has sealed a move back to the club where he. became one of the most feared strikers in world football. Veteran: Drogba has over 100 caps for the Ivory Coast and made over 200 league appearances for Chelsea. With Didier Drogba, the man whose penalty secured a first Champions League win for Chelsea in the clubs history returning to Stamford Bridge, we look at other frontmen who have returned to their former clubs. Those who have had a second coming have often enjoyed a hero’s welcome upon their return, but, on the pitch, were they hits or misses? Ian Rush (Liverpool 1980-87 & 1988-96)Having joined Liverpool from Chester as a youngster for £300,000 in May 1980, a British transfer record for a teenager at the time, it quickly became obvious that Rush was a prolific goal scorer. After six seasons and 168 goals, Rush made a surprise move to Juventus for £3.2 million. Just seven goals came in twenty nine appearances in Italy and, after his unrest became clear, Rush returned as a hero to Anfield. In his first campaign back at Liverpool, still officially on loan from Juventus, he blasted 30 league goals and went on to hit the net another 142 times in all competitions for the Reds. Verdict: Hit Robbie Keane (Tottenham 2002-08 & 2009-11)The Irish striker always had the potential to play at the top level. Having impressed at Coventry and Leeds via the briefest of stints at Inter Milan, Keane made his mark as a natural goal scorer at White Hart Lane. 80 league goals came in his first six years in North London. Keane ultimately could never rekindle that success after an unsuccessful move to Liverpool in 2008 and returned to Spurs the following February. Despite 15 goals in all competitions upon his return, Keane was never quite the same player.Verdict: Miss Mark Hughes (Manchester United 1980-86 & 1988-95)Hughes was on the score sheet 37 times in the league for Manchester United, having risen through the club’s academy ranks. His form could not be replicated once he left for Barcelona and he suffered similar problems at Bayern Munich, to whom he was then loaned. Hughes returned to Old Trafford and won the PFA Player of the Year Award in his first season back in England (1988/89). Under the stewardship of Sir Alex Ferguson, he went on to score over 100 more goals for the club and cemented himself in its rich history.Verdict: Hit Teddy Sheringham (Tottenham 1992-97 & 2001-03)Although Sheringham’s great trophy-winning days came at Manchester United between 1997 and 2001, he will always be remembered as a club legend by Spurs fans and players. He scored 99 goals in his first six years wearing the white of Tottenham and, after an extremely successful spell at Old Trafford, he returned to White Hart Lane to lift Tottenham fans from their seats another 26 times. He has since been inducted into their Hall of Fame.Verdict: Hit. Peter Crouch (Tottenham 1998-2000 & 2009-11)Another player to return to Tottenham was the familiar figure of Peter Crouch. He never played senior football for Spurs as a youth player, but returned over ten years later, for a fee reported to be around £9 million. Crouch had a mixed career at Spurs second time around, scoring 24 goals but also suffering two separate, three month long barren spells in front of goal. His hero status gained by scoring the winner against Manchester City in 2010, securing Spurs Champions League football was tarnished when he scored an own goal against the same opposition the following year. Spurs missed out on joining Europe’s elite on that occasion, with City qualifying.Verdict: Miss Thierry Henry (Arsenal 1999-2007 & 2012)The briefest of returns to Arsenal for the Frenchman. The fans wouldn’t have been bothered had he not scored at all after his 226 goals before he moved to Barcelona in 2007.

Two weeks later, the recall was extended to more than 400 consumer products made since Jan. 1, 2007, including Jenny Craig nutritional bars and Keebler Peanut Butter Sandwich Crackers, while the toll from the contamination had reached eight dead and more than 500 sickened in 43 states, half of them children. The company's factory in Blakely,Ga., which was the source of the contamination, supplied some of the largest food makers in the nation. The outbreak showed the complexities of the industrial food chain, and left consumers to figure out if some food in their cabinets had a danger. The recall of peanut products is the latest in a series of increasingly severe food contamination scares involving tomatoes, spinach, cantaloupes and other foods. TheGeorgiaplant, which is closed, packed peanut butter in bulk ranging from 5 to 1,700 pounds, much of which was shipped to institutions. Many school districts have pulled peanut butter from menus, with some substituting more commonly recognized supermarket brands. New York City school officials said they had not bought any peanut butter or products with ingredients that originated at theGeorgiaplant. An F.D.A. inspection team that visited the plant on Jan. 9 discovered that on 12 occasions in 2007 and 2008 tests conducted by the company found salmonella contamination in its products but that it shipped the contaminated products to customers after a retest found no contamination and did nothing to clean the plant.

Soon after, another woman is found raped and murdered in a field. Local detective Park Doo-man, not having dealt with such a serious case before, is overwhelmed; key evidence is improperly collected, the police's investigative methods are suspect, and their forensic technology is near non-existent. Detective Seo Tae-yoon is sent from Seoul to assist them; their methods clash and he is unable to convince them they are dealing with a serial killer until his predictions of another murder come true. He realizes that the killer waits until a rainy night, and only kills women wearing red. A female police officer realizes that a local radio station is always requested to play a particular song during the nights the murders are committed.While Seo investigates and tries to piece together the clues, Park and his men beat confessions out of a local man found masturbating at the scene of one crime, and a mentally retarded boy whom they threaten to kill, going so far as to make him dig his own grave. Seo clears both of those suspects and follows a trail of clues to a factory worker who had only moved to the area a short time before the first murder. The detectives are unable to pin anything on him; when they realize that the retarded boy witnessed one of the crimes and try to speak to him, they frighten him so badly that he runs in front of an oncoming train and is killed.Finally, when yet another murder is committed and DNA evidence sent for processing in the United States comes back inconclusive, Seo's frustrations flow over and he snaps.

Write a title for this article: Mark Sanchez can lose the cap and the clipboard for his start against Jacksonville on Sunday. “The biggest thing that I kept coming back to was who gives us the best opportunity to win,” Ryan said. “When I kept coming back to that, I believe the correct answer is Mark Sanchez.” Ryan solicited input from numerous people before making the decision, and he admitted there were dissenting voices. Ultimately, Ryan said it was his call and he did not receive any pressure from the Jets’ owner, Woody Johnson. Sanchez bottomed out last Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals, throwing three interceptions in the first half. Ryan finally satisfied booing fans at MetLife Stadium when he replaced the ineffective Sanchez with Greg McElroy late in the third quarter. In his N.F.L. debut, McElroy completed 5 of 7 passes for 29 yards and a touchdown in the Jets’ 7-6 win. The performance led to speculation that McElroy, the 2011 seventh-round pick out of Alabama, would unseat Sanchez. Ryan did little to extinguish those thoughts by mulling his options for 48 hours. Ryan informed the quarterbacks of the decision in a 10-minute meeting Wednesday morning that included the offensive coordinator, Tony Sparano, and the quarterbacks coach, Matt Cavanaugh. “I wanted to make sure that it wasn’t just a flying-off-the-handle move or something you would do haphazardly,” said Ryan, who has steadfastly defended Sanchez, especially this season, despite his increasingly poor play. “I wanted to make sure I was thorough with it. I know it’s a huge decision, but it’s one I feel great about.” Ryan said the team’s financial commitment to Sanchez had “absolutely zero” impact on the decision. Sanchez signed a three-year contract extension in March that guarantees him 8.25 million next season. “That’s the last thing on my mind,” Sanchez said. “I don’t know. Ask the coaches and management. That’s not my job.” McElroy took the same amount of reps as usual at Wednesday’s practice, which meant most of his time was spent with the scout team. He had no expectation that he would be named the starter and did not object to the decision. “Coach Ryan has been put in charge to make those decisions and to put the best player on the field that he thinks gives the team the best chance of being successful,” McElroy said. “That person is Mark and I obviously completely understand that.” The schedule gave Sanchez a reprieve with a road game against the Jacksonville Jaguars (2-10). EverBank Field figures to be a far more forgiving environment than MetLife Stadium. “It’s kind of similar to a road game,” Sanchez said of the home crowd’s reception last week. Jaguars fans will probably be disappointed that Sanchez received the start, but not because they are hoping to see McElroy. Instead, they will be clamoring for the hometown hero Tim Tebow, who had been the Jets’ backup all season until sustaining two broken ribs on Nov. 11. Tebow did not play in Week 12 against the New England Patriots and was inactive for the first time this season against the Cardinals. Ryan said Tebow will be the No. 2 quarterback Sunday if he’s “completely healthy,” a determination that will not be made until later in the week. X-rays taken last Sunday revealed some improvement for Tebow. “Obviously we’re all competitors, we all want to play,” Tebow said. “To say that I wouldn’t want to be in there playing, that’s not the truth. I would love to go in there and compete and help this team win football games.” Ryan conceded that Sanchez would be on a short leash if he struggled against the Jaguars. In Sanchez’s rookie season, Ryan devised a “red, yellow, green” system to help Sanchez’s decision making. The Jets (5-7) currently are in red — the most cautious phase — but that does not mean they are going to shy from throwing the ball. Ryan simply wants Sanchez to make better decisions and to avoid the unforced errors that have contributed to his 18 turnovers. Sanchez considered the benching a message and said it had been received. He will not be looking over his shoulder on Sunday. “I’ll be fine,” Sanchez said. “I know how to play better. Now it’s time to go prove it.” Despite the first benching he could remember since “maybe in basketball in fifth grade,” Sanchez’s confidence has not wavered. “I knew at some point before I died I’d start at quarterback again,” Sanchez said. “I’m just glad it’s this week.” Title:","completion":"Mark Sanchez Back as Starting Quarterback: Jets' Coach Ryan Makes the Call Against Jacksonville"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They have a beginning, a middle, and an end-- with ads thrown in every three or four minutes. The ads are unavoidable. They happen whether you want them or not. Every couple of minutes a billboard appears outside the bus window.\\"Buy Super Clean Toothpaste.\\"\\"Drink Good'n Wet Root Beer.\\"\\"Fill up with Pacific Gas.\\" Only if you sleep, which is equal to turning the television set off, are you spared the unending cry of \\"You Need It! Buy It Now!\\" The beginning of the ride is comfortable and somewhat exciting, even if you've traveled that way before. Usually some things have changed--new houses, new buildings, sometimes even a new road. The bus driver has a style of driving and it's fun to try to figure it out the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly daring, the ride can be as exciting as a suspense story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left-hand lane?After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know it will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement in that. The seat, of course, has become harder as the hours have passed.

If \\"Workers fix train tracks.\\", can we conclude \\"People repair tracks.\\"?","completion":"Yes, we can fairly conclude that \\"People repair tracks.\\" when we know that \\"Workers fix train tracks.\\" Let's break it down and analyze the statement to have a deeper understanding. The original statement, \\"Workers fix train tracks,\\" consists of three main components: 1. Workers: This term refers to individuals who are employed to perform tasks and duties within a specific context. In this case, these individuals are employed to maintain and repair train tracks, which implies that they are skilled and knowledgeable in this area. 2. Fix: The term 'fix' implies correcting, repairing, or restoring something to its original functional state. In this scenario, it pertains to performing the necessary maintenance and repairs to ensure that train tracks continue to function correctly. 3. Train tracks: Train tracks are the rails that allow trains to operate smoothly. These consist of steel rails that are fastened to sleepers (also known as ties) and are underlain by ballast, which helps distribute the load and provide stability. Train tracks are an essential element of a railway network and must be maintained to ensure the safe and efficient operation of trains. Now, when we say, \\"People repair tracks,\\" we are making a general statement that encompasses the following: 1. People: This term is a broader way to refer to individuals who may be involved in repairing tracks. While \\"workers\\" specifically implies that they are employed to do the task, the term \\"people\\" may include workers, volunteers, or other individuals who are part of the track repair and maintenance process. The term \\"people\\" here might not only refer to those who directly fix the tracks but also those who indirectly contribute to the process such as supervisors, engineers, or even track inspectors. 2. Repair: Similar to 'fix,' the term 'repair' denotes restoring something to its original functioning state. In this context, it involves the process of ensuring that train tracks are properly maintained, and any faults or wear are corrected so that trains can operate safely and effectively. 3. Tracks: In this case, we're still discussing train tracks. However, the word \\"tracks\\" may also be interpreted to encompass other types of tracks, such as tram tracks or even tracks for smaller rail-related vehicles. These tracks, like train tracks, also require maintenance and repair to keep their respective transportation systems operational. In conclusion, the statement \\"Workers fix train tracks\\" implies that there are individuals employed to maintain and repair train tracks. By saying \\"People repair tracks,\\" we can generalize the initial statement and include a broader range of individuals who might be involved in the repair and maintenance process of not just train tracks, but also other types of tracks related to rail transportation. Therefore, we can indeed conclude that \\"People repair tracks\\" when we know that \\"Workers fix train tracks.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options are: (A). applaud Quinn. (B). want a better show. (C). praise Quinn.","completion":"The audience at the comedy club that witnessed Quinn's terrible performance where he was booed off the stage would most likely have a mix of reactions. Most members of the audience would not applaud or praise Quinn due to the unsatisfactory performance, so options (A) and (C) would be improbable outcomes. Instead, they are more likely to feel disappointed and want a better show. Therefore, option (B) seems to be the most accurate representation of their response. When attending a comedy club, the audience expects a night of entertainment and laughter. They wish to indulge in engaging and light-hearted performances to escape their daily stresses and have a good time. When a comedian does not meet those expectations, the disappointment can prompt varying responses from audience members. Some guests may express their displeasure by booing the performer, demanding a better show or simply not laughing. In Quinn's case, being booed off the stage demonstrates the audience's discontent with his performance and reflects their desire for an improved show. They may hope for subsequent acts to save the evening and deliver the entertainment they were seeking. Moreover, witnessing a poor performance might create a buzz among audience members, leading to conversations about the night's events and discussing the lackluster act. This kind of negative word-of-mouth can potentially harm the comedian's reputation and bookings in the future. In summary, after witnessing Quinn being booed off the stage during a terrible performance, the audience will likely be disappointed and want a better show. They may express their disapproval with various reactions like booing, not laughing, or initiating conversations about the incident. Subsequently, they would want a more entertaining act to rectify the overall experience of their visit to the comedy club."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While driving his Dual-Ghia from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, lecherous, heavy-drinking pop singer Dino is forced to detour through Climax, Nevada. There he meets the amateur songwriting team of Barney Millsap, a gas station attendant, and piano teacher Orville J. Spooner, a man easily given to jealousy. Hoping to interest Dino in their songs, Barney disables the \\"Italian\\" sports car and tells Dino he will need to remain in town until new parts arrive from Milan. (Dual-Ghia was actually an American marque, mating a Dodge frame, drivetrain, and engine with Italian coachwork.) Orville invites Dino to stay with him and wife Zelda, but becomes concerned when he learns the singer needs to have sex every night to avoid awakening with a headache. Anxious to accommodate Dino but safeguard his marriage, Orville provokes an argument with his wife that leads to Zelda fleeing in tears. He and Barney then arrange for Polly the Pistol, a waitress and prostitute at a saloon on the edge of town called the Belly Button, to pose as Orville's wife and satisfy Dino. That evening after the three have dinner, Orville plays his tunes for Dino on the piano and Polly requests a particular song. It is one she knows he wrote for his wife when trying to persuade her to marry him. Doing so, Orville gets lost in emotion, as does Polly, who has fallen a little for the dream of a domestic life that she doesn't have. Under the influence of wine and song, Orville starts thinking of Polly as his wife and tosses Dino out. He then spends the night with Polly. Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who disables the sports car is Millsap. In the text, it is mentioned that \\"Barney Millsap, a gas station attendant\\" is the one who disables the sports car in order to persuade Dino to stay in town and show interest in his and Orville's songs.

Christine recommended a snail killing pellet because","completion":"it had proven to be effective in the past and was a safe and quick solution for the problem. These snail killing pellets are specifically designed to control snail populations and protect plants and landscaping from damage caused by these pests. The active ingredient in the pellets is a chemical called metaldehyde, which targets the snail's nervous system, eventually causing paralysis and death. This pesticide is not only highly efficient in eliminating snails but also poses minimal risks to other animals and the environment when used appropriately. Christine went on to explain the benefits and precautions of using snail killing pellets to Jessica in greater detail. One of the main benefits of these pellets is that they are easy to apply and maintain. A small handful of pellets can cover a significant area in the garden or yard, and they work effectively in damp and humid conditions, often when snails are most active. The pellets can be spread around the base of plants the snails prefer to feed on, creating a barrier that deters them from access and helps prevent further damage. Additionally, these pellets work relatively quickly, ensuring that snail populations can be brought under control in a short period. However, Christine reminded Jessica that there were essential precautions to take when using snail killing pellets. Firstly, it is imperative to ensure that pets and children don't come into contact with the pellets, as they may contain harmful substances that can cause health issues if ingested. To mitigate this risk, pellets should be kept out of reach and used according to the specified instructions on the product packaging. Another concern is the potential for the toxins to accumulate in the food chain. When a poisoned snail dies, and another animal such as a bird or a small mammal comes to feed on it, there is a chance that the toxins could make their way up the food chain. This is why it's crucial to monitor and remove any dead snails in a timely fashion manually. Moreover, choosing a brand of pellets that use lower concentrations of active ingredients or an alternative like iron phosphate-based products, which are more eco-friendly and equally effective, would be a responsible choice. Lastly, it's essential to keep in mind that not all snails and slugs are garden pests; some actually help maintain a healthy ecosystem. So, it's best to target areas with high infestations and use pellets in moderation to avoid disrupting the balance of the garden. With these points in mind, Jessica could make an informed decision about using snail killing pellets for her yard. Following Christine's advice and ensuring she takes the proper precautions would help her protect her prized plants, enhance the health and appearance of her garden, while also minimizing potential harm to other wildlife and the environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: Person holds onto tightropes in a snowy landscape. Hypothesis: The person is cutting the rope. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true just because the premise is true. Let's dissect both statements to clarify the situation. The Premise: \\"Person holds onto tightropes in a snowy landscape.\\" This statement presents a scenario but does not provide explicit information about what the person is doing with the tightropes other than holding onto them. The individual could be performing an array of actions. They could be walking on it, adjusting it, steadying themselves against it, preparing to make a move, or merely examining it. The environmental detail of a snowy landscape provides a context that invites various possibilities considering the challenging condition but gives no specific action to the person's interaction with the rope. The Hypothesis: \\"The person is cutting the rope.\\" This statement assumes a very specific action on the person's part – that of cutting the rope. It's possible, but not provided for or suggested directly by the premise. They might cut the rope if it's too long, if they're trying to remove an obstruction, or for some other reason. However, this is conjecture not based on the original premise. If the premise stated, for instance, \\"The person holds onto tightropes in a snowy landscape, with a knife in their other hand, appearing to saw at the rope\\", then the hypothesis would be better supported. In its current state, we cannot definitively conclude that the person is cutting the rope based on the premise provided, as it does not explicitly or implicitly suggest such an action. A conclusion based on some level of assumption can often lead to misunderstandings or crosstalk. Calibration of the narrative in a way that it holistically supports the hypothesis requires an alignment of details in both premise and hypothesis. For such, to conclude that the person is cutting the rope, we need more specific details suggesting such an action in the scenario mentioned. Hence, it is important to present clear, unambiguous statements, especially in the premise, to establish a reliable foundation for the hypothesis or conclusion. So, unless further detail is provided, the hypothesis remains unproven, despite the premise being true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sentence 1: - \\"At the end\\": This is a point in time, indicating that the action takes place at the conclusion of a story or event. - \\"Princess Minnie\\": The character who is performing the action. - \\"dubs\\": This verb means to confer a knighthood or title upon someone in a ceremonial manner. - \\"Mickey, Donald, and Goofy\\": The recipients of the title. - \\"royal musketeers\\": The title being conferred upon the recipients. Sentence 2: - \\"At the end\\" : This phrase has the same meaning as in the first sentence. - \\"Princess Minnie\\" : The character is also the same as in the first sentence. - \\"entitles\\": This verb means to give someone a legal right or claim to something, or to designate someone for a specific role or title. - \\"Mickey, Donald, and Goofy\\": Same recipients as in the first sentence. - \\"Royal Musketeers\\": The same title as in the first sentence, with the only difference being a change in capitalization.

Additionally, it's important to consider that individuals within a group may have different motivations and emotions.

Premise: \\"Quick follow them.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"It is important that you follow them.\\" true?","completion":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"It is important that you follow them\\" is true, we need to analyze the context and implications of the premise \\"Quick, follow them.\\" In doing so, we'll look at the possible intentions, situations, and challenges for the characters involved in this situation. The premise suggests urgency, implied by the use of the word \\"Quick.\\" This urgency is the primary indicator that following the subject(s) is important. There could be many reasons for the urgency, which we will explore below. 1. An immediate threat or opportunity: In cases where the subject(s) may present a danger or opportunity for those involved in the scenario, it becomes important to follow them closely to prevent harm or make the best of the situation. For example, the subject(s) may have vital information necessary for a decision-making process, and losing track of them could lead to adverse consequences. This lends credence to the hypothesis that following them is important. 2. Time-sensitive information or action: If the subject(s) are involved in an activity that requires prompt intervention or information extraction, the importance of following them is heightened. For instance, they may be fleeing the scene of a crime, carrying crucial evidence, or engaged in activities that require surveillance, such as participating in illegal transactions. In these cases, losing track of the subject(s) could mean losing valuable insight, potentially allowing the perpetuation of criminal activity or escape from justice. 3. Preventing harm or benefiting others: If following the subject(s) has the potential to prevent harm or provide benefits to others, then the hypothesis is further supported. For example, the subject(s) may have just saved someone from a dangerous situation and require additional assistance or resources. Failing to follow them could result in harm to the rescued individual or, on the contrary, provide a chance for grateful acknowledgment and potential reciprocation. 4. Maintaining group cohesion: If the subject(s) are part of a team or group working on a cohesive mission or task, following them becomes important to ensure group efficiency and collaboration. It's possible that the speaker perceives the importance of sticking together and is emphasizing this through their urgent instruction. 5. Personal reasons: The importance of following the subject(s) might be attached to personal relationships, attachment, or commitment, which lends support to the hypothesis. Should the speaker have emotional connections with the subject(s) or share a compelling consequence that involves others, then it becomes important to follow the subject(s) closely. Taking the aforementioned reasons into account, it's clear that the premise \\"Quick, follow them\\" likely implies a certain level of importance in following the subject(s). However, it's essential to consider the individual context and circumstances to determine whether the hypothesis \\"It is important that you follow them\\" is indeed true or false. In most scenarios, though, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the urgency and implications of the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: For many years, I was convinced that my suffering was due to my size. I believed that when the weight disappeared, it would take old wounds, hurts and rejections with it. Many weight-conscious people also mistakenly believe that changing our bodies will fix _ . Perhaps our mistake is believing that being thin equals being loved, being special, and being cherished. We fantasize about what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal .We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there. But we often gain back what we have lost. Even so, we continue to believe that next time it will be different. Next time, we will keep it off. Next time, being thin will finally fulfill its promise of everlasting happiness, self-worth, and, of course, love. It took me a long time to realize that there was something more for me to learn about beauty. Beauty standards vary with culture. In Samoa a woman is not considered attractive unless she weighs more than 200 pounds.

It was released but there were no marketing efforts behind it. After the release of the album, the band sought out drummer Max Schuldberg and they played their first concert as a foursome opening for Peter Murphy at Southern Star Amphitheater. They played concerts in Texas as a foursome for two years. Along with the three founders and newest member Max Schuldberg, the band added producer Stephen Bogle as guitarist to complete the line up. The band recorded and produced \\"Grip\\" under their own start up label, Gut Records. \\"Grip\\" went on to sell 15,000 units with the help of a crafty rework of Bad Company's \\"Feel like Makin Love\\". Universal Records, at the time a brand new start up label, heard of the success of \\"Grip\\" and signed the band as their second artist ever. \\"Devil Thumbs a Ride\\", the 3rd album, had already been recorded and mastered and was about to be manufactured for another self-release when Universal stepped in to sign the band and release the album as-is. The Hunger had a hit song in 1996, \\"Vanishing Cream\\", from the \\"Devil Thumbs a Ride\\" CD, which received heavy airplay on rock stations and reached No. 4 on the Mainstream Rock charts. After two years of constant touring, the band finally stopped to record their second release with Universal Records, \\"Cinematic Superthug\\". After only moderate success with the single, \\"Moderation\\", the band asked to be and was granted a release from their contract from Universal Records. Two songs, \\"Shoot to Kill\\", also from \\"Devil Thumbs a Ride\\", and \\"If\\", from \\"Grip\\", reached No. 42 on Billboard's Dance/Club Play chart. The band has released six albums: two on Universal Records and four on independent labels. Former original drummer (1991-2003) Max Schuldberg (voted 2002's Best Drummer by the Houston Press Music Awards) parted with the band after the five albums in 2003 and moved to Los Angeles. Former guitarist and two time Grammy Award nominee (remixer, for his work with D.J. Cubanito) Stephen Bogle now Produces artists in the Metal, Electronic, and Pop genres. In late 2005 Stephen Bogle parted ways with the band, and Tim Huston was quickly picked up. With having only a few practices with the band they headed on tour with Ten Years. Tim Huston Stayed with the band from late '05 til 2013. \\"The lifestyle was just getting to overwhelming for me to handle\\". \\"If I would have stayed, who knows what would have happened to me. There was just no off button\\". In 2013, guitarist Raf Rivera joined the lineup, and the band is currently in the process of recording their first new material in over 8 years. Context_3 : \\"Vision of Love\\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey. It served as Carey's debut single, the first from her eponymous debut album. Written by Carey and Ben Margulies, \\"Vision of Love\\" was released on May 15, 1990, by Columbia Records. After being featured on Carey's demo tape for Columbia, the song was re-sung and produced by Rhett Lawrence and Narada Michael Walden. \\"Vision of Love\\" features a slow-dance theme tempo and backing vocals sung by Carey herself, and introduces her usage of the whistle register. Lyrically, the song describes a past and present relationship with a lover. Carey describes the \\"vision of love\\" she dreamed of, as well as the present love she feels for him. Context_4 : The Roman de la Rose (] ; \\"Romance of the Rose\\"), is a medieval French poem styled as an allegorical dream vision. It is a notable instance of courtly literature. The work's stated purpose is to both entertain and to teach others about the Art of Love. At various times in the poem, the \\"Rose\\" of the title is seen as the name of the lady, and as a symbol of female sexuality in general. Likewise, the other characters' names function both as regular names and as abstractions illustrating the various factors that are involved in a love affair. Context_5 : Una Rosa Blu (\\"A Blu(e) Rose\\") is the seventh studio album by Mexican pop singer-songwriter Gloria Trevi, released by Univision Records on October 2, 2007 (see 2007 in music) in Latin America and the United States. It was produced by \\"Sergio George\\", \\"Bob Benozzo\\" and \\"Armando Avila\\". This album sold over 600,000 copies. In the US, the album sold about 50,000 copies during the first day of release [4] 1 and later received gold and platinum certifications by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) .2 In Mexico, it received Gold Record and Platinum and reached fifth place in sales nationwide. Una Rosa Blu reached a highest position of third place on the Billboard Latin Pop Albums, within a few weeks of its release. In Spain it was one of the Top 100 best selling albums in 2009. Context_6 : Tribute Records (Ben-Jamin' Universal Music) is an American gospel music record label established in 1990. The label was co-founded by jazz musician and former pro basketball player Ben Tankard and George King. King owned Nashville based Diadem Music Group which produced Contemporary Christian music. Diadem's signature artist Bob Carlisle is best known for his hit song \\"Butterfly Kisses\\". Tribute became the urban contemporary gospel (black gospel) division of Diadem and home to several gospel music stars, most notably Tankard (a keyboardist whose solo albums were instrumental releases), Yolanda Adams, Twinkie Clark of The Clark Sisters and others. Tankard was executive producer and music producer on most of the early Tribute releases and his vision was to develop artists and pioneer a new smooth genre of music he coined as \\"gospeljazz\\". He featured Yolanda Adam's jazzy vocals on the album and concept video single \\" You Bring Out The Best In Me \\" on his 1994 release \\"Play Me In Your Key\\". The jazzy collaborations of Tankard and Adams produced major crossover success and brought the name of Tribute Records to the forefront. Office Depot produced a gospel style \\" Taking Care Of Business \\" commercial national ad campaign that was centered on Tribute Records, Tankard, and Adams and ran from 1994-1996. Context_7 : Keno Don Hugo Rosa ( ), known simply as Don Rosa (born June 29, 1951), is an American comic book author and illustrator known for his stories about Scrooge McDuck, Donald Duck and other Disney characters. Many of his stories are built on characters and locations created by Carl Barks, including the story that brought him to fame as a modern Disney artist – the Harvey Award-nominated comic, \\"The Son of the Sun\\". Context_8 : Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1969 or 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. In 1990, she rose to fame with the release of \\"Vision of Love\\" from her eponymous debut album. The album produced four chart-topping singles in the US and began what would become a string of commercially successful albums which solidified the singer as Columbia Records' highest selling act. Carey and Boyz II Men spent a record sixteen weeks atop the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 in 1995–1996 with \\"One Sweet Day,\\" which remains the longest-running number-one song in US chart history. Following a contentious divorce from Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and traversed towards hip hop with the release of \\"Butterfly\\" (1997). In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards and subsequently named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000. Context_9 : Rosa kordesii, or Rosa\\" × \\"kordesii is a type of rose that arose naturally from hybridization followed by chromosome doubling. A hybrid between \\"R. rugosa\\" and \\"R. wichurana\\" was created called \\"Rosa\\" 'Max Graf', but it was diploid and nearly sterile, producing flowers but no fruit. This rose produced a few viable seeds as a result of self-pollination, and the seedlings that resulted were tetraploid instead of diploid, i.e., the chromosomes of both pollen and egg cells had been naturally duplicated. The tetraploid seedlings are amphidiploids. A selection with double deep pink flowers and repeat bloom, also called 'K01 AgCan' was released by W. Kordes' Söhne in 1951. Context_10 : Patrick Shevelle Love (born July 23, 1968) is an American gospel musician.

Information: - Forage fish, also called prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include particularly fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right. - Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , / trtkeli / is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Sweden . Commercially available triticale is almost always a second - generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first - cross ) triticales . As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye . Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop . Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale - based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) . The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself . The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia . In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world . The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species . In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid . In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale . Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time . The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application . The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries . Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals . The protein content is... - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for grazing animals such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. Hay is also fed to smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Pigs may be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as more fully herbivorous animals. - Rice is the seed of the grass species \\"Oryza sativa\\" (Asian rice) or \\"Oryza glaberrima\\" (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. - Silage is fermented, high-moisture stored fodder which can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals) or used as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digesters. It is fermented and stored in a process called \\"ensilage\\", \\"ensiling\\" or \\"silaging\\", and is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type (\\"oatlage\\" for oats, \\"haylage\\" for alfalfa but see below for the different British use of the term \\"haylage\\"). - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Rye (\\"Secale cereale\\") is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus \\"Hordeum\\") and wheat (\\"Triticum\\"). Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats. - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses includes genera with many domesticated species. Major crop genera found in this tribe include wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other genera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or rangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some of the most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains the genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat \\"Triticum\\" species. Seed storage proteins in the Triticeae are implicated in various food allergies and intolerances. - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - GRAIN (initially the International Coalition for Development Action or ICDA) is a small international non-profit organisation that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems. - The chicken (\\"Gallus gallus domesticus\\") is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs. - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. - Frankfurt am Main is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2015 population of 731,095 within its administrative boundaries, and 2.3 million in its urban area. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr. Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates. - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals. - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin. - There are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble (stems), leaves, and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground, or burned first. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks, seeds, bagasse, molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment, fertilizers and in manufacturing. - Stuttgart ( Swabian: \\"Schduagert\\"), often nicknamed the \\"\\"Schwabenmetropole\\"\\" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the \\"Stuttgarter Kessel\\" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word \\"\\"Stuogarten\\",\\" or \\"stud farm\\" a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish). - Wheat (\\"Triticum\\" spp., most commonly \\"T. aestivum\\") is a cereal grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), originally from the Levant region but now cultivated worldwide. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century. - Animal feed is food given to domestic animals in the course of animal husbandry. There are two basic types, \\"fodder\\" and \\"forage\\". Used alone, the word \\"feed\\" more often refers to fodder. - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa. - Biodiversity, a contraction of \\"biological diversity,\\" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.

Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Tuesday the creation of a new trade enforcement unit that will be tasked with investigating unfair trade practices in countries, he said, \\"like China.\\" It was one of a handful of comments on international issues the president made during his annual State of the Union address, which mostly focused on domestic matters and the economy. President Obama challenges Congress on sticky issues \\"It's not right when another country lets our movies, music and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized,\\" Obama said. \\"I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules.\\" From 2008 and 2010, China had pegged the yuan to the dollar, keeping its value artificially low and","completion":"making its exports cheaper. This has been a contentious issue between the US and China, as it gives Chinese manufacturers an unfair advantage in international trade. \\"We need a level playing field, so that American companies and workers can compete fairly and succeed,\\" Obama emphasized during his speech. The new trade enforcement unit will consist of experts and investigators who will monitor trading practices and act against any violations. The unit will have the power to enforce existing trade laws, file international complaints, and even impose sanctions on countries found to be violating fair trade practices. President Obama emphasized the importance of this unit as a tool for promoting fairness and protecting American businesses and jobs. He also urged Congress to do its part in supporting the American economy by closing tax loopholes that benefit companies that outsource jobs and rewarding those that bring jobs back to the US. \\"It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas and start rewarding businesses that create jobs right here in America,\\" the president said. The State of the Union address highlighted the administration's commitment to combating unfair trade practices and prioritizing domestic concerns such as job creation. It remains to be seen how effective the new trade enforcement unit will be in achieving these goals, but President Obama has made it clear that his administration will take a tougher stance on countries, like China, who engage in unfair trade practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

D) It is the consequence of people's unbalanced lifestyle.","completion":"The author presents a few myths and misconceptions surrounding exercise and weight gain. According to the author, being fat is not solely due to family genes or a slow metabolism. The main reason is that people with weight issues often share the same habits of eating too much and exercising too little. Consequently, the author believes that being fat is a consequence of an individual's unbalanced lifestyle (D). To address some of the discussed myths: 1. \\"I come from a fat family\\" - While there may be a genetic predisposition to be of a certain body type, the author emphasizes that poor lifestyle choices, such as overeating and lack of exercise, significantly contribute to weight gain. 2. \\"I am fat because I burn calories slowly\\" - The author refutes this claim by explaining that weight gain is not caused by a slow metabolism. While fat people may consume more energy than slim people, the key issue is that they often fail to accurately acknowledge how much they eat. 3. \\"Exercise is boring\\" - The author states that boredom can be avoided by developing a balanced and varied exercise program, including trying new activities and incorporating different challenges to make exercise more engaging. 4. \\"No pain, no gain\\" - Pain is not a necessary aspect of exercise and could indicate potential harm to the body. Mild discomfort might be experienced during the initial stages of exercise, but persistent pain should be taken seriously and requires proper medical attention. In conclusion, the author feels that being fat is a result of an unbalanced lifestyle consisting of excessive food intake and insufficient physical activity (D).

Keep in mind that working with glass can be dangerous, so always wear safety gloves and goggles before starting the task. Step 1: Assess the damage Examine the window frame to determine the exact problem. It could be broken glass, damaged or rotten wooden frame, loose joints, or broken locks and handles. Step 2: Gather the necessary tools and materials Based on the damage assessment, gather the tools and materials needed to perform the repair. Common repair tools include the following: - Safety gloves and goggles - Tape measure - Hammer and nails - Screwdriver and screws - Putty knife or chisel - Wood filler or epoxy (if repairing wood) - Sandpaper - Paint or wood preservative (if necessary) - Replacement glass (if required) - Glass cutter (if needed) - Glazing points - Glazing putty or caulk Step 3: Remove the broken glass (if applicable) If the glass is damaged, you will need to replace it. Carefully remove any broken glass by gently tapping it with a hammer to break it into smaller pieces. Use a putty knife to remove the glazing putty holding the glass in place and remove any old glazing points as well. Be sure to dispose of the glass safely in a designated container. Step 4: Repair the frame If the window frame is damaged, you will need to repair it. For a wooden frame, remove any loose or rotten wood and fill the holes with wood filler or epoxy. Once the filler has dried, sand the surface to make it smooth and even with the rest of the frame. Step 5: Install the new glass (if applicable) Measure the opening in the frame and have a new glass panel cut to size. You can use a glass cutter to cut the glass yourself or have a professional do it. Place the new glass panel into the frame and secure it using glazing points. Space the glazing points evenly along the edges of the glass. Step 6: Apply glazing putty or caulk Use a putty knife to apply a layer of glazing putty or caulk around the edges of the glass, pressing it firmly against the window frame. This will help secure the glass and provide a weatherproof seal. Step 7: Paint or treat the frame (if necessary) If the repaired frame needs painting or applying a wood preservative, do so once the glazing putty or caulk has dried according to the manufacturer's instructions. This will protect the frame from further damage and ensure a clean, finished look. Step 8: Reassemble and check Reinstall any hardware that was removed, such as locks and handles. Check the window's operation to ensure it opens and closes smoothly and securely. By following these steps, you can successfully repair a glass window frame and restore its functionality and appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Information: - Johan August Strindberg (22 January 1849 14 May 1912) was a Swedish playwright, novelist, poet, essayist and painter. A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg's career spanned four decades, during which time he wrote over 60 plays and more than 30 works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis, and politics. A bold experimenter and iconoclast throughout, he explored a wide range of dramatic methods and purposes, from naturalistic tragedy, monodrama, and history plays, to his anticipations of expressionist and surrealist dramatic techniques. From his earliest work, Strindberg developed innovative forms of dramatic action, language, and visual composition. He is considered the \\"father\\" of modern Swedish literature and his \\"The Red Room\\" (1879) has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel. - The Protestant Reformation, often referred to simply as the Reformation (from Latin \\"reformatio\\", \\"restoration, renewal\\"), was a schism from the Roman Catholic Church initiated by Martin Luther and continued by John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and other early Protestant Reformers in 16th century Europe. Timing most commonly used for this period is from 1517 (the Ninety-five Theses are published by Martin Luther) to 1648 (Peace of Westphalia ends the Thirty Years' War). - Swedish literature refers to literature written in the Swedish language or by writers from Sweden. - Master Olof ( Swedish : Mäster Olof ) is a historical drama in five acts by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg . The story is about the reformer Olaus Petri 's struggle against the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century . First written in 1872 , Strindberg rewrote it many times in both prose and verse . Ludvig Josephson ( the new artistic director of Stockholm 's New Theatre ) agreed to stage Master Olof , eventually opting for the prose version -- the five - hour - long première opened on 30 December 1881 under the direction of August Lindberg to favourable reviews . This production represented Strindberg 's breakthrough in the theatre . - Olof Persson, sometimes Petersson (January 6, 1493 April 19, 1552), better known under the Latin form of his name, Olaus Petri (or less commonly, Olavus Petri), was a clergyman, writer, judge and major contributor to the Protestant Reformation in Sweden. His brother, Laurentius Petri (Lars Persson), became the first Evangelical Lutheran Archbishop of Sweden. - Laurentius Petri Nericius (1499 27 October 1573) was a Swedish clergyman and the first Evangelical Lutheran Archbishop of Sweden. He and his brother Olaus Petri are, together with the King Gustav Vasa, regarded as the main Lutheran reformers of Sweden. They are commemorated by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on April 19. Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'country of origin' with the subject 'master olof'. Choices: - europe - sweden A:","completion":"The object entity that exhibits the relation 'country of origin' with the subject 'Master Olof' is Sweden.

Answer: In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"The answer provides a brief introduction to the creators of the first rabies vaccine. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive response, here is an expanded answer: The first successful rabies vaccine was developed by Louis Pasteur, a renowned French chemist and microbiologist, and Pierre Paul Émile Roux, a French physician, bacteriologist, and immunologist. Together, they made significant advancements in the field of immunization and public health. Louis Pasteur is best known for his development of the pasteurization process, which involves heating liquids to a specific temperature for a certain period to kill harmful bacteria. Concurrently, he discovered that microorganisms cause many diseases, and he played a pivotal role in developing the germ theory of disease. During the 1870s and 1880s, Pasteur shifted his attention to the study of infectious diseases, specifically anthrax and rabies. Rabies is a viral disease that affects the nervous system and is typically transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected animal, such as a dog or a bat. At that time, rabies was a serious public health issue that induced fear and panic amongst the masses. In 1881, Pasteur, along with Roux, began researching an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for rabies. They used a technique called serial passage, which involved transferring live virus through different animal hosts. The virus was extracted from the spinal cords of infected rabbits, allowed to dry for several days to weaken its virulence, and then injected into healthy animals. Upon completing the serial passage, the rabid animal tissue was less potent, allowing it to be used as a vaccine. On July 6, 1885, after a series of successful experiments on animals, Pasteur and Roux tested the first-ever rabies vaccine on a human. The boy, named Joseph Meister, had been bitten by a rabid dog, and the vaccine was administered to him at the risk of potential danger. However, after receiving the treatment, Meister did not develop any symptoms of rabies, signifying the vaccine's success. This pioneering work by Pasteur and Roux paved the way for modern preventive medicine and vaccination strategies. Today, the rabies vaccine has saved countless lives and has led to the development of vaccines for numerous other infectious diseases. Louis Pasteur's work in the field of immunology goes beyond the rabies vaccine, as he also contributed significantly to the understanding and prevention of diseases such as anthrax, cholera, and tuberculosis. This makes him one of the most influential figures in medical history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Here are some examples to illustrate both the positive and negative connotations: Positive usage: 1. In the context of a product price reduction, \\"dropped\\" may indicate that an item's price has been lowered, which is considered positive for shoppers as they can save money. Example: \\"The price of the product has dropped significantly, making it more affordable for consumers.\\" 2.

Referring to a highly anticipated release by a musician or a software company: \\"The artist dropped their new album,\\" or \\"The company dropped the latest software update.\\" In both cases, the phrase carries a positive meaning as it signifies the availability of something new and exciting. Negative usage: 1. In the context of an object or possession: \\"He dropped his phone, and the screen broke.\\" Here, the phrase refers to the physical act of accidentally dropping something, which typically leads to damaging that item – a negative event. 2. When referring to performance or engagement: \\"The company's sales dropped significantly in the past quarter,\\" or \\"The student's grades dropped due to a lack of focus.\\" In these instances, the phrase denotes a downward trend or a decline in performance, which is generally seen as negative. 3. In social relationships, \\"dropped\\" may signify an undesired ending or discontinuation: \\"They suddenly dropped communication,\\" or \\"She dropped out of the project.\\" These examples imply an unanticipated or unwanted interruption, which is generally viewed as unfavorable. In summary, the phrase \\"dropped\\" can take on either positive or negative connotations depending on the context.

The sprawling complex houses modern government offices, the Bedouin tent in which Gadhafi received visitors and stands of palm trees. A bombed-out building remains as a monument to a 1986 U.S. airstrike that killed one of Gadhafi's daughters, along with a statue of a Libyan fist crushing an American jet. And Tuesday evening, after rebel fighters who have battled Gadhafi's forces for six months punched into the compound, it was wreathed in smoke. Rebels posed around the statue and fired hundreds if not thousands of rounds of ammunition into the air in celebration, spurring the occasional rebuke from senior fighters. The rebels picked through the compound in search of Libya's longtime strongman, but one fighter told CNN that neither Gadhafi nor any members of his family had been found. Bab al-Aziziya appeared to have been abandoned so quickly that a teakettle remained heating on a stove in one building, he said. \\"They ran away, all of them,\\" he said. \\"They have gone underground.\\" Bab al-Aziziya, located near Tripoli's Mediterranean shore, is believed to be undergirded by a network of tunnels. Abubaker Saad, a former Gadhafi aide, told CNN that at least one of the older buildings on the site was built atop a bunker four stories underground.

Step 2: Research the topic In order to answer this question, I will collect information about the East River, its water conditions, pollution levels, and any regulations or restrictions that may apply to swimming there. Step 3: Analyze the findings Based on my research, there are several factors that make swimming in the East River in New York City not advisable or prohibited: 1. Water quality: The East River has a history of pollution, with industrial and sewage contamination being major concerns. Although efforts have been made to improve water quality, it still may not be clean enough for safe swimming, posing potential health risks. 2. Currents and tides: The East River is known for its strong currents and tidal variations, which can make swimming dangerous and challenging even for experienced swimmers. Rapidly changing conditions can quickly turn a swim into a dangerous situation. 3. Boat traffic: The East River is a busy waterway with various types of boats, such as ferries, barges, and recreational vessels, frequently passing through. Swimming near or among this boat traffic is risky and may result in serious injury or even death. 4. Regulations and restrictions: Due to the factors mentioned above, swimming in the East River is generally not allowed, and there may be fines or penalties for doing so. Public safety agencies and local authorities discourage swimming in the East River for the protection of everyone involved. Step 4: Provide the answer Based on the analysis of my findings, the main reasons that you cannot swim in the East River in New York City are the water quality, strong currents and tides, boat traffic, and regulations and restrictions put in place to ensure public safety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: (CNN)It's long been known that dogs and cats, with their highly developed sense of smell, can be trained to identify the volatile chemicals released by human illnesses. In some cases, researchers have even trained household pets to detect cancer or predict epileptic seizures. But what if we could fine tune that sense and put it into a microchip, allowing us to create a breathalyzer for diseases? For Dr. Andrew Koehl, the inventor of the microchip spectrometer technology at the heart of this \\"digital nose\\", the technology that will allow us to do just that is already here. \\"We can detect down to parts per billion levels,\\" Koehl says. \\"To give you an analogy that's equivalent to one drop in an Olympic size swimming pool.\\" The sensor, which is no bigger than a dime, works by creating a spectrum of what chemicals are in the air. It then identifies each chemical's unique make-up. If the sensor is set and calibrated to a certain level, it will trigger an alarm. Work continues to shrink it even further in a bid to enter the healthcare market. Within several years, the company hopes to develop it as a diagnostic tool. \\"What's amazing is that there really are compounds on your breath that indicate illness, that's been shown through a number of studies and we can detect those,\\" he said. \\"There have already been a number of research papers published suggesting we can detect cancer, detect tuberculosis, detect asthma.\\" Initially, the technology had been developed for defense purposes. He said the threat posed by the events of September 11 had got him thinking about the security applications of this type of sensor. \\"Originally it was aimed at detecting things like explosives, toxic chemicals and other threats that might occur,\\" Dr Koehl told CNN. Developed at a research lab at the University of Cambridge in the UK and now in commercial production at a company called Owlstone with close links to the university, Dr Koehl says the sensor is already in use by oil industry giants like BP and Shell and in the food industry by Coca Cola and Nestle. Eventually the sensor could become a part of many everyday appliances, alerting consumers to which foods are going bad in the fridge or even the optimum moment to take the roast out of the oven. You could even, one day, have a digital nose that you could carry in your hip pocket. \\"More recently we've been looking at consumer spaces so we're talking to a number of manufacturers of mobile phones and mobile phone components,\\" he said. \\"We want to develop a module small enough to put into mobile devices like phones.\\"","completion":"Imagine if we had a tiny chip that can smell things just like a dog or a cat!

Here are possible answers to this question: - eat - go somewhere - dance - express information - play hockey I believe the correct choice is \\"dance\\", here's why:","completion":"When people feel a lot of excitement, their natural reaction is to engage in activities that channel their high energy and enthusiasm. Out of the options presented, \\"dance\\" is indeed a common and fitting choice as it allows individuals to express their feelings through movement and rhythm. Dancing can trigger the release of endorphins, contributing to overall happiness and a sense of well-being. However, it is essential to recognize that reactions to excitement can vary from person to person, and different individuals might have unique responses. Here's a brief elaboration of the other options: 1. Eat: Some people may indulge in food when they are excited, especially if the event causing excitement is related to food or celebrations such as birthday parties, festivals, or gatherings. 2. Go somewhere: Excitement can also spur a desire to explore new places, share experiences with friends, or embark on a thrilling adventure. Traveling or going somewhere different is one way people might channel their excitement. 3. Express information: Sharing one's excitement with others is a natural response, as it allows individuals to communicate their feelings and build social connections. This expression may occur through various means – face-to-face conversations, phone calls, social media, or other communication channels. 4. Play hockey: Engaging in sports or physical activities can also be an outlet for excitement, as they allow people to vent their energy and focus on a competitive and skilled task. While hockey is a specific example, other sports or recreational activities may serve a similar purpose, depending on personal preferences. In conclusion, while \\"dance\\" is a fitting choice for people to respond to excitement, it is essential to consider individual preferences and inclinations when assessing how people may react in such situations. They may engage in a combination of activities, such as eating, traveling, expressing emotions, or participating in sports, to channel their excitement effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - \\"Something About a Woman\\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Jake Owen.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last of the person who was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience? , can you please find it? Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression.

Summarize this article: The bigger the cow is, the more you have to feed her. Although, a bigger cow may produce more milk, you don’t want a monthly feed bill that exceeds what you’re able to spend. Holsteins are the biggest eaters and will cost the most. Brown Swiss cows are somewhere in the middle. Jerseys are the smallest and need the least amount to eat. What kind of cow do you think you can handle? Can you deal with nervous cows or would you need to have very docile ones? Take this into consideration when selecting a breed. Brown Swiss cows are the most docile dairy cows. Holsteins tend to be a bit nervous. Jerseys can be notorious kickers. If you are raising a cow to be part of a dairy farm, obviously milk production will be a crucial factor. On the other hand, if you only need enough milk for your family, you may not need such a high-production breed. You may wish to mix your herd if it's for commercial reasons, such as adding a few Jerseys to a predominantly Holstein herd to increase the Holstein's butterfat content. If you're looking to maximize milk production, Holsteins are the way to go. If you're only wanting milk for you and your family, you may want to consider a cow that doesn't give as much milk (such as a Jersey). Breeds that are dual-purpose (produce both milk and meat) may be ideal, but this will produce less milk overall. You may also want a dairy cow for butter and cheese making. Jerseys and Brown Swiss produce milk higher in butterfat and protein content, making them ideal for cheese and butter making. Dairy cows that have been culled from conventional dairy operations are cheaper. However, such cows may have injuries, illnesses, or inability to breed back. If you are a dairy farmer just starting out, avoid these cull animals. As a hobby farmer you may not mind the time, money and feed invested in rescuing and caring for one or two cull dairy cows. Summary:","completion":"When choosing a dairy cow, consider factors such as feed costs, temperament, and milk production. Holsteins require the most feed and produce the most milk, while Jerseys need less feed and have lower milk output. Brown Swiss cows are docile and have moderate needs. Assess if you need high-production breeds or dual-purpose ones for milk and meat. Jerseys and Brown Swiss are ideal for butter and cheese making due to their higher butterfat and protein content. Avoid purchasing culled cows if you're starting a dairy farm, as they may have health issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: The Raven Movie plot: After Jean Thatcher (Ware) has been injured in a car accident, her father, Judge Thatcher (Hinds) and beau Jerry (Matthews) implore retired surgeon Dr. Richard Vollin (Lugosi) to perform a delicate operation to restore her to health. Vollin agrees and is successful; he befriends the spirited and grateful Jean, in the process revealing his passion for all things related to Edgar Allan Poe, including his homemade collection of torture devices inspired by Poe's works (such as a pit, pendulum with crescent razor, shrinking room, etc.), and identifying the raven as his talisman. After Vollin reveals his growing love for Jean to her father, the Judge quickly discourages him from the affair. Angered, Vollin hatches a plan when Edmond Bateman (Karloff), a murderer on the run, comes to his home asking for a new face so he may live in anonymity. Vollin admits to not being a plastic surgeon, but says he can help Bateman, and asks him to help in exacting revenge on the Thatchers, which he refuses. Bateman explains that he feels his antisocial behavior is a result of having been called ugly all his life, and he hopes a new face may gave him a chance to end it. Vollin performs the surgery, but instead turns Bateman into a disfigured monster, promising only to operate again on Bateman when Vollin's revenge is exacted. Bateman finally reluctantly agrees.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Lula Grace Johnson (born March 13, 1929), known professionally as Jan Howard, is an American country music singer and Grand Ole Opry star. She attained popular success as a country female vocalist during the 1960s and early 1970s and was twice nominated for the Best Female Country Vocal Performance Grammy award. Many of her hits were written by her husband at the time, Harlan Howard. Howard's biggest hit and signature song was the 1966 country hit \\"Evil on Your Mind\\", which peaked at number five on the Billboard country charts. In 1959, under the name Jan Howard, she released the single \\"Yankee Go Home\\", which failed to hit the country charts. In 1960, the Howards went to Nashville, Tennessee, where they appeared on The Prince Albert Show, the Grand Ole Opry segment carried nationally by NBC Radio. Howard then released her first single under her new record company, Challenge. Titled \\"The One You Slip Around With\\", the song was Howard's first significant country hit, hitting the top 15, peaking at number 13 on the Billboard country music chart and earning her several Most Promising Female Vocalist awards (over, among others, another newcomer, Loretta Lynn). Occasional appearances on the Grand Ole Opry led to friendships with several country singers, including Patsy Cline. According to Cline's 1980 biography, Honky Tonk Angel, Cline originally yelled at Howard after a performance on the Opry stage. Howard fought back, and Cline was shocked by her reply. Cline then said to Howard, \\"Anybody who stands up to Cline is all right, we're gonna be good friends.\\" The two were good friends until Cline's death in 1963. Meanwhile, painfully shy Jan was suffering from the psychological scars of her youth, as well as the anxiety of beginning a new adventure. When her weight dropped below 97 pounds, Harlan hospitalized Jan and she went into therapy. Howard appeared on ABC-TV's Jubilee USA on February 6, 1960, and later that year she won Billboard magazine's Most Promising Female Country Award.

Believes the 2003 invasion of the country was a 'political cock-up' Says the people of Iraq are not better off since the war in the country. Warns against UK forces going back into the country again. Major General led Royal Marines during the 1982 Falklands War. Article:","completion":"Title: Major General Faults UK Politicians for the 'Complete Mess' in Iraq: A Deep Dive into the Consequences and Possible Solutions The 2003 invasion of Iraq has long been a subject of scrutiny and controversy. Major General Julian Thompson, a prominent figure in the military who led the Royal Marines during the 1982 Falklands War, has recently come forward to put the blame of the disastrous situation in Iraq firmly on the shoulders of UK politicians. Thompson unabashedly refers to the invasion as a “political cock-up,” highlighting the fact that little has improved for the citizens of Iraq since the war. In this article, we delve deeper into the Major General's assertions, examining the consequences of the invasion and whether the UK should shoulder responsibility for attempting to heal the wounds left behind through further intervention. It is important to first understand the motivations behind the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a war that toppled Saddam Hussein's regime but left the country in a state of turmoil. The campaign, which was led by the United States and supported by the UK, was based on the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). As it later became apparent, this belief was unfounded, further damaging the credibility of the UK’s involvement. According to Major General Thompson, the people of Iraq have not been better off since the war. The invasion and its aftermath led to the rise of ISIS, fueling a sectarian conflict that the country is still grappling with today. The devastation endured by the Iraqi population extends far beyond the immediate violence of the war itself, with lasting effects such as damaged infrastructure, fractured communities, and an ever-present culture of fear. In light of these conditions, it is difficult not to see the wisdom in the Major General's words. Having experienced the challenges of leading military forces in war, Thompson also warns against the UK making the same mistake twice by re-entering the country. The Major General's cautionary words are supported by the fact that the last attempt to intervene in Iraq not only failed to achieve its objectives but also created a new set of problems for the people of Iraq to contend with. Instead of attempting another military intervention, the Major General suggests that the UK should explore other avenues of support. These might include diplomatic efforts to help establish a stable government in Iraq, offering financial assistance to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure, and working collaboratively with international teams to stem the influence of extremist groups in the country. Given the current global landscape, with wars and military conflict continuing to wreak havoc on countless lives, it is crucial for UK politicians to learn from the mistakes made during the Iraq invasion. It is evident that the well-being of the people of Iraq has not been sufficiently addressed, creating an environment where violence and sectarian tensions can continue to thrive. In conclusion, Major General Julian Thompson makes a compelling case for UK politicians to reconsider their approach to foreign policy. As the consequences of the 2003 invasion of Iraq remain, it is now the responsibility of the UK and its allies to reflect on their missteps and take responsibility for their actions. Recognizing and learning from these errors is the first step towards creating a more just and stable world for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How to buy silver stocks Reduce your portfolio risk. Research suggests that precious metals have a weak, negative correlation to equities markets. This means that when regular stock prices decline, silver, and by extension your silver stocks, will either increase in value, remain unaffected, or at least not lose as much value as the remainder of your portfolio.","completion":"1. Identify silver stocks to invest in - In order to buy silver stocks, we first need to identify potential silver companies that are publicly traded. Look for established companies with strong financials and a good track record in the industry. This can be done by searching stock market platforms or financial news websites for recommendations and lists of top silver stocks. 2. Conduct thorough research - After identifying potential silver stocks, conduct thorough research on each. Look at their financial statements, annual reports, and any public announcements or news articles featuring the company. Analyze their revenue, net income, debt levels, cash flow, and other financial metrics to determine if they are a financially sound investment. 3. Diversify your silver stocks - Instead of putting all your money into one silver stock, it's essential to diversify your investment across several silver companies. This helps to minimize the risk of any one company underperforming or suffering a decline in its stock price. Look for companies operating in different regions, with varying levels of production, and focused on different aspects of the silver mining and refining process. 4. Assess your risk tolerance - Consider how much risk you are willing to take with your investment in silver stocks. Remember that investing in stocks comes with inherent risks, and the price of silver can be volatile. Adjust your portfolio allocation based on your risk tolerance, ensuring that you maintain a well-balanced and diversified portfolio. 5. Choose a reliable brokerage platform - To buy silver stocks, you will need to open an account with a reliable brokerage platform offering the silver stocks you want to invest in. Compare platforms based on fees, customer support, trading tools, and overall reputation before making a decision. 6. Place your order - After opening your brokerage account, you can place an order to buy silver stocks. Be familiar with the platform's trading tools and types of orders available, such as market orders (buying stocks at the current market price) and limit orders (buying stocks only if the price reaches a specified limit). 7. Monitor your investment - Once you have purchased your silver stocks, regularly monitor your investment's performance. Pay attention to news and announcements related to the companies you have invested in, as well as any global factors that may affect the price of silver. This will help you make informed decisions about when to buy more or sell your existing holdings. By following these steps, you can successfully buy silver stocks, diversify your portfolio, and potentially reduce the overall risk of your investments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Individual Person Data: The name of the person mentioned in the sentence, \\"Albert Jennings Fountain\\", can be extracted as a structured data element. This can later be mapped to an entity in a database storing personal information. 2. Geographic Data: \\"The United States\\" is mentioned as a geographical location. This information can be normalized and stored as structured data under a geography category. 3. Ethnic Group Data: The phrase \\"African Americans are an ethnic group\\" suggests an ethnic group data point, 'African Americans'. This piece of data can be associated with the previously mentioned geographic location, indicating that the ethnic group resides in the United States. The structured data derived from this sentence would look like this in a tabular form: | Person | Place of Birth | Ethnic Group | |----------------|----------------|---------------| | Albert Jennings Fountain | United States | African Americans | However, it should be noted that the context of the information here is indirect. The sentence does not explicitly state that Albert Jennings Fountain is an African American or born into the ethnic group of African Americans. Instead, it generally states that African Americans are an ethnic group in the United States. Therefore, these structured data elements should be treated as separate information pieces rather than directly linked attributes of Mr. Fountain. As such, in understanding structured data, precision and context are just as vital as the data points themselves.

Westley Piermont at the lavish wedding of his daughter. Piermont introduces him to model June Evans, but neglects to mention neither one is a guest. June is there to help the daughter with her wedding dress. Both pretend to be rich. Tommy gives June his telephone number, but neither expects anything to come of their momentary attraction to each other. That night, after she tells her family about her adventure, her obnoxious, younger, musician brother Chick phones Tommy, pretending to be June's servant, and forces his sister to continue the charade. Tommy is pressured to maintain the masquerade as well by his roommate Al, an insurance salesman who dreams of making contacts in New York high society. They begin seeing each other. Their first date is at the Westminster Dog Show, where they run into Piermont again. He has two dogs entered in the competition. Piermont insists his Pomeranian will win, but Tommy champions his other entry, a St. Bernard. Sure of himself, the millionaire promises to give the St. Bernard to Tommy if it wins. It does, and he does. With no place to keep it, Tommy makes a present of it to June. Their second date is at a movie theater where another of June's brothers works. By this point, June's family is anxious to meet her boyfriend. Her aunt Lucy is the housekeeper for a wealthy family, so while her employers are away, she borrows their home to host a dinner. Afterward, Tommy tries to confess to June, but she misunderstands and thinks he has found her out instead.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Vampire Bat is set in the small German village of Klineschloss where Gustave Schoen (Lionel Belmore) the Burgermeister is holding a meeting with Inspector Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas) from the local constabulary about all the recent murders, six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all drained of blood & bearing the same two puncture wounds on their necks. Brettschneider doesn't have a single clue but the superstitious elders of the village believe the deaths to be the work of a Vampire. Brettschneider isn't convinced but the scared villagers keep telling tales of seeing a large Bat, meanwhile the latest victim Martha Mueller (Rita Carlyle) has been found. Brettschneider comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders but can he really believe that a giant Vampire Bat is responsible & if it is how's he going to stop it? Directed by Frank R. Strayer The Vampire Bat was a cheapie from Majestic Pictures to cash in on the success of it's two stars Atwill & Wray & their success in the previous years Doctor X (1932) & is more of a murder mystery rather than a horror as the exploitative & enticing title may have lead you to believe & quite frankly it's rather dull. The script by Edward T. Lowe Jr. takes itself rather seriously & sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers & that something could possibly be a Vampire, then for most of it's duration the film focuses on Brettschneider & his incompetent investigations which are, not to put too fine a point on it, boring. The Vampire Bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it doesn't quite know what it wants to be, the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes descending into silly sci-fi. There is no Vampire Bat, the attempts to fool you are pathetic, all the character's are broad stereotypes & you can tell the villain of the piece straight away & as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about The Vampire Bat. I know it's old but that's not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933 & a bland, flat, dull, boring & misleading film such as The Vampire Bat just doesn't cut it these days, just look at the original King Kong (1933) released the same year & how brilliantly that still holds up today. I didn't like it & I doubt many modern film-goers would either, it's as simple & straight forward as that. Director Strayer doesn't do anything special but this is a case in point where I can cut the film some slack because of it's age, as a whole it's pretty much point, shoot & hope for the best stuff. There isn't much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from The Old Dark House (1932) & Universal's European set on their back-lot are nice & add a certain ambiance to things. Technically The Vampire Bat can't compare to anything even remotely modern, for the age of it it's alright I suppose but again I draw your attention back to the original King Kong. Speaking of King Kong it's star Fay Wray has a role in this as does horror icon Lionel Atwill, I'll be kind & say the acting is OK. The Vampire Bat will I imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that it's a horror film about Vampire Bats when in fact it isn't, personally I thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore. It's short & it tells it's story reasonably enough but I must admit I'm not a fan. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?

Let me try to make it simpler for you. Wind, cyclones, and anti-cyclones are caused by the heat from the sun. When the sun heats the Earth, it also heats up the air above it. Warm air likes to rise, and cooler air likes to sink. So, when the warm air goes up, it leaves a space, and the cooler air moves in to fill this space. This movement of air is what we call wind. Cyclones and anti-cyclones are like big spinning circles of wind. Cyclones happen when warm air rises quickly and spins around, creating a storm. Anti-cyclones are the opposite; they happen when cool air sinks down and spins in the opposite direction, making the weather calm and clear. So, sun's heat creates differences in air temperature, and this movement of air creates wind, cyclones, and anti-cyclones."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: In the merry-go-round of GOP presidential politics, is it about to be Newt Gingrich‘s time to take a turn as a frontrunner? Recent polls suggest that he’s on the way up, currently in a respectable third place behind an embattled Herman Cain and a tepidly-supported Mitt Romney. Perhaps more importantly, Gingrich is escalating his use of over-the-top rhetoric that will get him more attention, as he did this weekend when he likened President Obama to convicted Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff. The comment came during a Lincoln-Douglas-style debate that Gingrich shared with Herman Cain, which proved to be more of a media circus than meaningful debate due to Cain’s recent sexual harassment allegations. In fact, the most noteworthy item that came from the debate was Cain’s blasting of the press for asking questions about the scandal surrounding him. Gingrich drew a predictably unfavorable comparison between GOP saint Ronald Reagan and the current sitting president, though the metaphor was more focused on their respective rhetoric: We have today a President and….compare him to Ronald Reagan who told the truth — great book called “The Education of Ronald Reagan” on lessons he learned at General Electric — compare Reagan’s ability to talk directly to the American people, make sense and have the American people move the Congress with the current president. This president is about as candid and accurate as Bernie Madoff in what he tells the American people. Now that‘s hyperbole! It’s easy to dismiss this sort of over-the-top political rhetoric as poetic license, but comparing President Obama with a convicted felon who bilked millions of individual investors with lies and deceit will likely only resonate with voters who have already long decided that Obama is the Worst President Ever™ no matter what evidence is presented to them, one way or the other. Watch the clip below, courtesy of C-SPAN (H/T Business Insider): Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| Was it a thoughtful pause or an indication that Herman Cain may not know as much about Medicare as a presidential hopeful should? That’s just one question that arose in the wake of this weekend’s debate between Cain and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. At one point during the evening, Americans for Prosperity Texas chairman Ben Streusand asked Cain whether he favored a “defined benefit plan” or “premium support” when it comes to Medicare. Cain repeated the question to himself while looking upward and appearing to mull it over, later turning it over to Gingrich to answer first.

Answer a question about this article: One study showed that Czech and Slovak lexicons differed by 80 percent, but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation; Slovak morphology is more regular (when changing from the nominative to the locative case, Praha becomes Praze in Czech and Prahe in Slovak). The two lexicons are generally considered similar, with most differences in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology. Slovak has slightly more borrowed words than Czech. When is Slovak morphology more regular than Czech?","completion":"Slovak morphology is considered more regular than Czech in the way it forms word structures, particularly when it comes to changing the cases of words in a sentence. This regularity can be observed in the consistency of Slovak morphological patterns compared to the more irregular patterns found in Czech. One example highlighted in the article is the change from the nominative to the locative case. In the mentioned example, when changing the word \\"Praha\\" (the capital city of the Czech Republic) from nominative to locative case, the transformation is more regular in Slovak. In Czech, \\"Praha\\" becomes \\"Praze,\\" while in Slovak, it becomes \\"Prahe.\\" This illustrates how Slovak maintains a more consistent and regular pattern when compared to Czech. Moreover, the article states that the two lexicons – Czech and Slovak – are generally considered similar despite their 80% difference. This difference is primarily due to differing orthographies (spelling systems) and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation. The majority of differences between the two languages can be found in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology. Additionally, it's noted that Slovak has slightly more borrowed words than Czech. In conclusion, Slovak morphology is more regular than Czech when it comes to forming word structures and changing cases in a sentence. This can be observed in the consistent morphological patterns in Slovak, making it easier to predict how words will change across different cases compared to the more irregular patterns present in Czech."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Village of the Damned Movie plot: The quiet coastal town of Midwich, California is invaded by an unseen force which leaves ten women mysteriously pregnant. Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation.

Q:Information: - McKinley Morganfield (April 4, 1913 April 30, 1983), better known as Muddy Waters, was an American blues musician who is often cited as the \\"father of modern Chicago blues\\". - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - St. Louis is an independent city and major U.S. port in the State of Missouri, built along the western bank of the Mississippi River, on the border with Illinois. The city has an estimated 2015 population of 315,685, and is the cultural and economic center of the Greater St. Louis area (home to 2,916,447 people), making it the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the 19th-largest in the United States. - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment. - A work song is a piece of music closely connected to a form of work, either sung while conducting a task (usually to coordinate timing) or a song linked to a task which might be a connected narrative, description, or protest song. - The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the tenth edition of \\"The Oxford Companion to Music\\", Percy Scholes defines musical form as \\"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\\" - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Cologne is the largest city in the German federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the fourth-largest city in Germany (after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich). It is located within the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, one of the major European metropolitan regions and the largest in Germany, with more than ten million inhabitants. - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it. - A chant (from French ', from Latin ', \\"to sing\\") is the rhythmic speaking or singing of words or sounds, often primarily on one or two main pitches called reciting tones. Chants may range from a simple melody involving a limited set of notes to highly complex musical structures, often including a great deal of repetition of musical subphrases, such as Great Responsories and Offertories of Gregorian chant. Chant may be considered speech, music, or a heightened or stylized form of speech. In the later Middle Ages some religious chant evolved into song (forming one of the roots of later Western music). - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power. - Manhattan is the most densely populated borough of New York City, its economic and administrative center, and the city's historical birthplace. The borough is coextensive with New York County, founded on November 1, 1683, as one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York. The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the East, Hudson, and Harlem rivers, and also includes several small adjacent islands and Marble Hill, a small neighborhood on the U.S. mainland. - Nick Katzman ( born 1951 ) is an American blues musician . Katzman was born in New York City , and lives in both Manhattan and Berlin , Germany . He plays in a variety of musical genres , including Chicago blues , Mississippi blues , Texas blues , and ragtime . - Ragtime also spelled rag-time or rag time is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - Ernest Hogan (born Ernest Reuben Crowdus; 1865 May 20, 1909) was the first African-American entertainer to produce and star in a Broadway show (\\"The Oyster Man\\" in 1907) and helped to popularize the musical genre of ragtime. - Harlem is a large neighborhood in the northern section of the New York City borough of Manhattan. Since the 1920s, Harlem has been known as a major African-American residential, cultural and business center. Originally a Dutch village, formally organized in 1658, it is named after the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands. Harlem's history has been defined by a series of economic boom-and-bust cycles, with significant population shifts accompanying each cycle. - The \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (copyright registered on 18 September 1899) is an early ragtime musical composition for piano composed by Scott Joplin. It was one of Joplin's early works, and became the model for ragtime compositions by subsequent composers. It is one of the most famous of all ragtime pieces. As a result Joplin was called the \\"King of Ragtime\\". The piece gave Joplin a steady if unspectacular income for the rest of his life. - John Philip Sousa (November 6, 1854 March 6, 1932) was an American composer and conductor of the late Romantic era, known primarily for American military and patriotic marches. Because of his mastery of march composition, he is known as \\"The March King\\", or the \\"American March King\\" due to his British counterpart Kenneth J. Alford also being known by the former nickname. Among his best-known marches are \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" (National March of the United States of America), \\"Semper Fidelis\\" (Official March of the United States Marine Corps), \\"The Liberty Bell\\" (used as the theme for Monty Python's Flying Circus), \\"The Thunderer\\" and \\"The Washington Post\\". - Bruce Iglauer (born July 10, 1947, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States) is the American founder and head of the independent blues record label Alligator Records in Chicago. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. - The Deep South is a cultural and geographic subregion in the Southern United States. Historically, it is differentiated from the \\"Upper South\\" as being the states most dependent on plantation-type agriculture and considered slave societies during the preCivil War period. The Deep South was also commonly referred to as the Lower South or the Cotton States, for their production of cotton as the primary commodity crop. - The Chicago blues is a form of blues music indigenous to Chicago, Illinois. Chicago blues is a type of urban blues. Urban blues evolved from classic blues following the Great Migration, or the Great Northern Drive, which was both forced and voluntary at times, of African-Americans from the southern United States to the industrial cities of the north, such as Chicago. Muddy Waters directly joined that migration, like many others, such as in Florida, avoiding the more harshly southern Jim Crow laws. Bruce Iglauer, founder of Alligator Records stated that, \\"Chicago blues is the music of the industrial city, and has an industrial sense about it.\\" Additionally, recognizing the shift in blues, Chicago Blues singer and guitarist, Kevin Moore expressed the blues transition stating, \\"You have to put some new life into it, new blood, new perspectives. You can't keep talking about mules, workin' on the levee.\\" Chicago blues was heavily influenced by Mississippi bluesman who traveled to Chicago in the early 1940s. The development of blues, up to Chicago blues, is arguably as follows: Country blues, to city blues, to urban blues\\". Chicago blues is based around the sound of the electric guitar and the harmonica, with the harmonica played through a PA system or guitar amplifier. - Research comprises \\"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\" It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc. - Scott Joplin (1867/68 April 1, 1917) was an African-American composer and pianist. Joplin achieved fame for his ragtime compositions and was dubbed the \\"King of Ragtime Writers\\". During his brief career, he wrote 44 original ragtime pieces, one ragtime ballet, and two operas. One of his first pieces, the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", became ragtime's first and most influential hit, and has been recognized as the archetypal rag. - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments. - Düsseldorf (Low Franconian, Ripuarian: \\"Düsseldörp\\" ) is the capital city of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the seventh most populous city in Germany. Düsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs. The city is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe Düsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. - A guitar amplifier (or guitar amp) is an electronic amplifier that strengthens the weak electrical signal from a pickup on an electric guitar, bass guitar, or acoustic guitar so that it can produce sound through one or more loudspeakers, which are typically housed in a wooden cabinet. A guitar amplifier may be a standalone wood or metal cabinet that contains only the power amplifier (and preamplifier) circuits, requiring the use of a separate speaker cabinetor it may be a \\"combo\\" amplifier, which contains both the amplifier and one or more speakers in a wooden cabinet. There is a wide range of sizes and power ratings for guitar amplifiers, from small, lightweight \\"practice amplifiers\\" with a single 8\\" speaker to heavy combo amps with four 10\\" speakers and a powerful amplifier, which are loud enough to use in a nightclub or bar performance. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - The headquarters of the United Nations is a complex in New York City designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. The complex has served as the official headquarters of the United Nations since its completion in 1952. It is located in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, on spacious grounds overlooking the East River. Its borders are First Avenue on the west, East 42nd Street to the south, East 48th Street on the north and the East River to the east. The term \\"Turtle Bay\\" is occasionally used as a metonym for the UN headquarters or for the United Nations as a whole. - Headquarters (HQ) denotes the location where most, if not all, of the important functions of an organization are coordinated. In the United States, the corporate headquarters represents the entity at the center or the top of a corporation taking full responsibility for managing all business activities. In the UK, the term head office is most commonly used for the HQs of large corporations. The term is also used regarding military organizations. - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. - Benjamin Robertson \\"Ben\\" Harney (March 6, 1872 March 2, 1938) was an American songwriter, entertainer, and pioneer of ragtime music. His 1896 composition \\"You've Been a Good Old Wagon but You Done Broke Down\\" is regarded as one of the early ragtime composition. In 1924, the New York Times wrote that Ben Harney \\"probably did more to popularize ragtime than any other person.\\" Time Magazine termed him \\"Ragtime's Father\\" in 1938. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.

Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"Although these two sentences may appear similar at first glance, they actually convey different information. Here is a detailed analysis of each sentence: Sentence 1: \\"After the death of his father, James Holman, on 4 March 1827 he was elected king in the presence of King George.\\" In this sentence, James Holman is the father who passed away on March 4, 1827. After his death, his son (whose name is not mentioned) was elected king. This event occurred in the presence of King George, who can be inferred as a separate person, possibly a monarch from another kingdom, witnessing the election of the new king. Sentence 2: \\"After the death of his father, King George, he was elected king in the presence of James Holman on March 4, 1827.\\" In this sentence, the father who died is King George, and the event took place on March 4, 1827. After his death, his son (whose name is, once again, not mentioned) was elected king. This time, James Holman is not the deceased father but a separate individual who was present during the election of the new king.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you're new to following recipes, get out all of the ingredients you'll need and prepare them. If a recipe calls for dicing, mincing, or slicing ingredients, for instance, do all of the prep work first so you can start making the food. If you already feel comfortable doing prep work while you cook food, read through the recipe to see when to do specific prep. For example, if you're caramelizing onions, they'll probably take a long time. Get them cooking and then prep the rest of the ingredients while they're caramelizing. Instead of roasting large chunks of vegetables or boiling entire potatoes, chop them into smaller pieces than you usually do. Vegetables that are 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) in size will cook much faster than 2 to 3 in (51 to 76 mm) pieces. If you're really short on time, try dicing or grating the food. For example, instead of cooking chunks of home fries, grate the potatoes to make hashbrowns. You can even cut meat and seafood into smaller pieces. Slice a large roast or fillet into smaller and thinner pieces to cut down on cooking time. A lot of cooking and baking recipes direct you to use softened butter instead of cold butter from the fridge or freezer. Although you could warm the butter in the microwave, you might accidentally melt it. Try grating the butter against the coarse side of a box grater before using it in the recipe. This works best if the butter is very cold or frozen. Try this trick the next time you're baking biscuits or scones. It's much easier than rubbing or cutting chunks of butter into the dry mixture! The time you spend washing, chopping, and preparing ingredients adds up if you're cooking every day. To save on some of this prep time, consider what you'll be cooking for the week and prep the ingredients at the same time. Then, you can just pull what you need out of the refrigerator when you're ready to cook. For example, if you need diced onion for 2 meals, chop the onion and store them in separate containers in the refrigerator. If you're making rice for dinner and you also plan to serve it in a few days, make a double batch and refrigerate half of it. If you're making a few different things to serve, think about which dishes take the longest to cook and which can be prepared right before serving. If it helps you stay organized, write down a timeline of when to prep and cook each dish. Your list might look like this: Marinate chicken for 3 hours Start the grill 30 minutes before dinner time Remove the chicken and thread it onto skewers Put the chicken skewers on the grill Bring a pot of water to boil and cook rice noodles Remove the chicken from the grill Make a tossed salad to serve with the chicken and rice noodles Your food will cook evenly if the oven is already at the recommended temperature when you put the food in. If you put food into a cold oven while it's heating up, it will take longer to cook and the bottom or outside of the food could overcook before the center is done. For example, if you toss a frozen pizza into a cold oven that's heating up, the bottom may burn while the center only becomes warm. If you put it into a hot oven, the whole pizza will cook within the recommended time.

Please answer the following question: Information: - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - An economist is a practitioner in the social science discipline of economics. - John Locke (29 August 1632 28 October 1704) was an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the \\"Father of Liberalism\\". Considered one of the first of the British empiricists, following the tradition of Sir Francis Bacon, he is equally important to social contract theory. His work greatly affected the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His writings influenced Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, as well as the American revolutionaries. His contributions to classical republicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence. - Greater Boston is the metropolitan region of New England encompassing the municipality of Boston, the capital of the U.S. state of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England, as well as its surrounding areas. The region forms the northern arc of the U.S. northeast megalopolis and as such, Greater Boston can be described as either a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or as a broader combined statistical area (CSA). The MSA consists of most of the eastern third of Massachusetts, excluding the South Coast region and Cape Cod; while the CSA additionally includes the municipalities of Manchester (the largest city in the U.S. state of New Hampshire), Providence (the capital of the U.S. state of Rhode Island), Worcester, Massachusetts (the second largest city in New England), as well as the South Coast region and Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Greater Boston's most impactful contributions to human civilization involve the region's higher education institutions and sports culture. Greater Boston also constitutes a region influential upon American history and industry. The region and the state of Massachusetts are global leaders in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - A single tax is a system of taxation based mainly or exclusively on one tax, typically chosen for its special properties, often being a tax on land value. The idea of a single tax on land values was proposed independently by John Locke and Baruch Spinoza in the 17th century. The French physiocrats later coined the term \\"impôt unique\\" because of the unique characteristics of land and rent. - Harvard is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts. The town is located 25 miles west-northwest of Boston, in eastern Massachusetts. A farming community settled in 1658 and incorporated in 1732, it has been home to several non-traditional communities, such as Harvard Shaker Village and the utopian Transcendentalist center Fruitlands. Today it is an affluent residential town noted for its excellent public schools, with its students consistently ranking in the state's top ten test results in English and math. The population was 6,520 at the 2010 census. - In the United States, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area. Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be, nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states. As such, the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source. A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region (e.g., Chicago or Atlanta). However, some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position (e.g., DallasFort Worth metroplex, Norfolk-Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), RiversideSan Bernardino (Inland Empire) or MinneapolisSaint Paul). - Frederick Fiske Warren ( 2 July 1862 -- 2 February 1938 ) was a successful paper manufacturer , fine arts denizen , United States tennis champion of 1893 , and major supporter of Henry George 's single tax system which he helped develop in Harvard , Massachusetts , United States , in the 1930s . Fiske Warren established Georgist single tax colonies and a social experiment in Andorra to disprove Malthus 's population theory . He was the son of Samuel Dennis Warren and Susan Cornelia Warren of Beacon Hill , Boston , and the brother to U.S. Attorney Samuel D. Warren and to Edward Perry Warren . - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Beacon Hill is a historic neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood is 9,023. - Baruch Spinoza (born Benedito de Espinosa, ; 24 November 1632 21 February 1677, later Benedict de Spinoza) was a Dutch philosopher of Sephardi/Portuguese origin. By laying the groundwork for the 18th-century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism, including modern conceptions of the self and the universe, he came to be considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy. - Edward Perry Warren (January 8, 1860 December 28, 1928), known as Ned Warren, was an American art collector and the author of works proposing an idealized view of homosexual relationships. He is now best known as the former owner of the Warren Cup in the British Museum. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - Henry George (September 2, 1839 October 29, 1897) was an American political economist, journalist, and philosopher. His immensely popular writing is credited with sparking several reform movements of the Progressive Era, and inspiring the broad economic philosophy known as Georgism, based on the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves, but that the economic value derived from land (including natural resources) should belong equally to all members of society. - Boston (pronounced ) is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States. Boston is also the seat of Suffolk County, although the county government was disbanded on July 1, 1999. The city proper covers with an estimated population of 667,137 in 2015, making it the largest city in New England and the 23rd most populous city in the United States. The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.7 million people in 2014 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country. Alternately, as a Combined Statistical Area (CSA), this wider commuting region is home to some 8.1 million people, making it the sixth-largest as such in the United States. - Georgism, also called geoism and single tax (archaic), is an economic philosophy holding that, while people should own the value they produce themselves, economic value derived from land (including natural resources and natural opportunities) should belong equally to all members of society. Developed from the writings of Henry George, the Georgist paradigm offers solutions to social and ecological problems, relying on principles of land rights and public finance which attempt to integrate economic efficiency with social justice.

(b). blocks dull.","completion":"The monkey loved to play with the balls but ignored the blocks because he found the blocks dull. The colorful and bouncy balls were far more appealing to the curious little monkey than the unexciting, solid blocks. Even though the blocks had the potential to be stacked and built into various structures, the monkey couldn't see beyond their bland appearances and rigid angles. The balls, on the other hand, offered seemingly endless entertainment as they rolled and bounced in unpredictable ways, stimulating the monkey's mind and satisfying his playful spirit. As the monkey continued to play with the balls, he would often find himself tossing them from one hand to another, sometimes even using his prehensile tail to catch them in mid-air. His agility and dexterity were remarkable, and the other animals in the jungle marveled at his acrobatic prowess. The monkey reveled in the attention he received, which only fueled his preference for the balls over the blocks. However, he didn't realize that the blocks could have contributed significantly to his cognitive development. They had the potential to teach him about problem-solving, balance, and spatial awareness. If he had given the blocks a chance, his playtime could have been both enjoyable and educational, helping him grow as an individual and equipping him with valuable skills for survival in the jungle. But as the days passed by, the monkey continued to disregard the blocks, which had been slowly accumulating dust in the corner of his play area. He was enamored with the balls, convinced that they were the epitome of entertainment. One day, however, something unexpected happened. It began to rain heavily, and the balls, being lightweight and buoyant, started to float away in the rising floodwaters. Seeing his favorite toys floating away, the monkey was devastated but quickly realized that the blocks, with their weight and solidity, remained anchored on the ground. Desperate to save his precious balls, he began to stack and arrange the blocks, forming makeshift barriers to keep the balls from being swept away by the currents. In this moment of crisis, he discovered that the blocks had a purpose and value after all. From this experience, the monkey learned that sometimes the most unassuming objects can hold hidden potential. He recognized that the blocks, which he once deemed dull and unworthy of his time, could be immensely useful and even enjoyable when creatively utilized. This lesson stayed with the monkey as he continued to grow and explore his jungle home, and he never again underestimated the value of any object, regardless of its appearance or initial impression. Thanks to this newfound wisdom, the monkey became a versatile and resourceful member of the jungle community, admired and respected by his fellow animals for his ability to see potential in everything around him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Voters will decide between the Democratic candidate , Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump of the Republicans. But the voting is not a must for each person in the US. So quite a lot of people choose not to vote, especially the young generation. According to Fox News, one-in-five young voters between the ages of 18 and 35 said clearly that they wouldn't vote for either of the two candidates. Just 12 percent of voters aged 35-54, and only nine percent of voters aged 55 and older said the same thing. This is not only because young people don't like Clinton or Trump, according to theFortunemagazine. The truth is that they are traditionally less likely to vote than their parents. \\"Young people are not at an age in their life when they think politics or government has anything to do with them,\\" said Rodd Freitag, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, US. \\"But for the older age groups, they have a home, they pay taxes , they care about schools and the community.\\" Many believe that the civic education of an American youth is another reason why they don't vote.

Context: A school board in the eastern state of Virginia has filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to halt a ruling that allows a transgender student to use the boys’ restroom next school year. The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August. Question: What does the school board want?

Option b, positive, is the correct choice in this context. Let's break down the sentence to understand why the sentiment is positive: 1. \\"powerful\\" - This adjective signifies strength, intensity, or effectiveness, which is regarded as a positive trait or quality in creative works, including movies. 2. \\"naturally dramatic\\" - This phrase implies that the drama in the film occurs organically, without being forced or artificial. This term is also viewed as a positive quality in filmmaking, as it suggests the film manages to evoke emotions and engage the audience in a genuine way. 3. \\"low-budget\\" - While this term generally refers to the limited financial resources used to make the film, it does not necessarily imply a negative sentiment. In this context, the sentence indicates the movie's achievements in being powerful and dramatic despite the budget constraints. This showcases the filmmakers' ability to make a strong impact on their audience with limited resources, which is a commendable and positive aspect. These elements combined lead to the conclusion that the sentiment expressed in the sentence is positive, highlighting the strengths and successes of the film despite its low-budget status."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To maintain the purity of her sample, Kayla had followed a step-by-step process: 1. First, Kayla washed her hands thoroughly with soap and warm water to remove any dirt or debris that could potentially contaminate the sample. 2. Next, she sanitized the area where the sample was to be collected, making sure to use an appropriate disinfectant to kill any lingering bacteria or viruses. 3. Once the area was sufficiently clean, Kayla put on protective gloves to minimize the risk of transferring any contaminants from her hands to the sample. 4. She then carefully collected the sample using sterilized equipment, paying close attention to avoid any cross-contamination from nearby sources. 5. After collecting the sample, Kayla immediately sealed it in a sterile container to ensure that it remained uncontaminated during storage and transport.

Background: John Charles Wiltshire-Butler (born 1 April 1975), known professionally as John Butler, is an Australian singer, songwriter, and music producer. He is the front man for the John Butler Trio, a roots and jam band, which formed in Fremantle, Western Australia in 1998. The John Butler Trio has recorded five studio albums including three that have reached number one on the Australian charts: Sunrise Over Sea, Grand National and April Uprising. His recordings and live performances have met with critical praise and have garnered awards from the Australian Performing Right Association and Australian Recording Industry Association. Context: The early sessions for the John Butler Trio's sixth studio album commenced in mid-2013, following the band's largest tour of the US. For the first time in the band's lifetime, the members began with a blank songwriting slate, rather than using the initial ideas of Butler that had been introduced. Butler gathered with Luiters and Bomba at The Compound in Fremantle, Western Australia, which serves as the band's headquarters and the frontman's artistic space, and co-wrote material for the first time, deviating from the Butler-centric process of the past: \\"I had always brought the material.\\" After contributing a large portion of work towards the album, Bomba eventually left the Compound space to work on his Melbourne Ska Orchestra project and was replaced by Grant Gerathy. Butler explained in an interview during the band's US tour: But a lot of these songs on this album I kind of magpied. Magpies are this bird in Australia that takes shiny things from anywhere and builds its nest, and so that's kind of what I do. I'll take a little of my own experience of having some heavy party time with certain friends, and then I'll hear some other stories about addicts or other intense relationships. I'll put them into the mixing pot and make up these characters to explore different possibilities and emotional landscapes. One of the songs on the album, \\"Wings Are Wide\\", was written as a dedication to his grandmother, who gave Butler his grandfather's Dobro guitar that became the foundation for his songwriting. Butler admitted that \\"I wasn't at all into roots music or playing the slide or anything when I got it, and it sat under my bed for a long, long time.\\" Released in Australia on 8 February 2014, Flesh and Blood was produced by Jan Skubiszewski and features a vocal duet with Ainslie Wills.

When winter came, they were often hungry. One morning the hungry man fell into the river and nobody found him. Jack's mother left her three-year-old son without saying goodbye. His aunt had to look after him. Twenty years passed. Jack became a tall, strong man. He worked on a farm. He worked hard and wanted to get more money to marry . He often went to see his aunt with some nice presents. The woman was very happy. But one day she died in a traffic accident . The young man was very sad. After he buried her, he decided to buy a beautiful tombstone for her. He went to the town and came into a shop, but all the tombstones were too expensive.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It often happens that a number of applicants with almost the same qualifications and experience all apply for the same position. In their educational background, special skills and work experience, there is little, if anything, to choose between half a dozen candidates. How then does the employer make a choice? Usually on the basis of an interview. There are many arguments for and against the interview as a way of selection. The main argument against it is that it results in a wholly _ decision. As often as not, employers do not choose the best candidate. They choose the candidate who makes a good first impression on them. Some employers, of course, reply to this argument by saying that they have become so experienced in interviewing staff that they are able to make a good assessment of each candidate's likely performance. The main argument in favor of the interview is that an employer is concerned not only with a candidate's ability, but with his or her suitable personality for the particular work situation. Many employers, for example, will overlook occasional mistakes from their secretary if she has a pleasant personality. It is perhaps true to say, therefore, that the real purpose of an interview is not to assess the assessable aspects of each candidate but to make a guess at the things that are hard to measure, such as personality, character and social ability. Unfortunately, both for the employers and applicants for jobs, there are many people of great ability who simply do not interview well. There are also, of course, people who interview extremely well, but are later found to be very unsatisfactory employees. Candidates who interview well tend to be quietly confident, but never boastful , direct and straightforward in their questions and answers; cheerful and friendly, but never over-familiar; and sincerely enthusiastic and optimistic. Candidates who interview badly tend to be either very shy or over-confident. They either talk too little or never stop talking. They are either over polite or a bit rude.

As a changed man burdened with guilt and shame, Terrell's primary goal upon release is to seek redemption and a fresh start in the world outside the confines of his prison cell. Upon reentering society, Terrell moves in with his estranged sister, Jasmine. Though their relationship has been strained since Terrell's incarceration, she is his only family and support system on the outside. Jasmine works hard to keep Terrell focused on rebuilding his life, helping him secure a job at a local construction site. Despite Terrell's best efforts to leave his criminal past in the past, he unexpectedly encounters an old acquaintance, Ray, a slimy and manipulative former partner from his heist days. Seeing an opportunity to exploit Terrell's skills and past connections, Ray enlists Terrell's help for one last, potentially life-changing heist. Torn between loyalty to his old friend and his desire for redemption, Terrell is faced with a moral dilemma that could jeopardize the life he's trying to rebuild. As Terrell contemplates his decision, he meets Sarah, a kind-hearted and empathetic woman who runs a community outreach program for ex-convicts. Sensing the internal struggle Terrell is going through, she shares her own story of losing her brother to the criminal lifestyle and offers her guidance to keep him on the right path. As their friendship grows, Sarah's support and understanding become Terrell's motivation to stand up against the temptations of his old life. Terrell ultimately defies Ray's pressure and refuses to participate in the heist. Ray, feeling betrayed, becomes a looming threat bent on revenge. As the story unfolds, Terrell must navigate the dangers of his past, the anxieties of his present, and the hopes for his future. In doing so, he learns the meaning of self-forgiveness and discovers his own self-worth. In the climax, Terrell confronts Ray and prevents the heist from happening, leading to Ray's arrest. Knowing he's done the right thing, Terrell is finally able to let go of his past demons and look forward to a new chapter in his life. The Path to Redemption is a film that delves into the complexities of human choices, the power of forgiveness, and the potential for redemption we all hold within ourselves. As Terrell Singletery's journey of self-discovery unfolds, viewers are reminded that even the most seemingly irredeemable can find a way back to grace and hope."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? Every restaurant that advertises in any of these papers happens to have four stars in the handbook.","completion":"To determine whether the given sentence is syntactically and semantically acceptable, let's break it down step by step and justify each step: 1. Analyzing the sentence structure: The sentence appears to have a clear subject (\\"Every restaurant\\") followed by relative clauses that provide additional information about the subject (\\"that advertises in any of these papers\\" and \\"happens to have four stars in the handbook\\"). The sentence follows a standard subject-verb-object structure and seems to be syntactically correct. 2. Assessing semantic acceptability: \\"Every restaurant\\" refers to a defined group of restaurants that meet the criteria specified in the sentence. The relative clause \\"that advertises in any of these papers\\" narrows down the set of restaurants to only include those that place ads in the mentioned papers. \\"Happens to have four stars in the handbook\\" adds another piece of information about the restaurants' rating in an unspecified handbook. The sentence conveys a concept that can be easily understood and seems to be semantically acceptable. It states that all restaurants advertising in the mentioned papers coincidentally have a four-star rating in the handbook.

Can we draw the following conclusion? William George \\"Billy\\" Zane, Jr. is sometimes referred to as America's greatest dramatic actor. OPT: 1). Yes; 2). It's impossible to say; 3). No;","completion":"2). It's impossible to say While Billy Zane is a talented actor with a diverse range of roles to his name, it's impossible to definitively say that he is America's greatest dramatic actor. The title of \\"greatest dramatic actor\\" is highly subjective, and opinions on who deserves this accolade can vary greatly depending on individual preferences and experiences with different actors. Zane has been successful in a variety of projects and established a notable career in the film and television industry, but there are numerous other dramatic actors who have also made significant contributions to the art form. Some might argue that other actors, such as Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, or Denzel Washington, are more deserving of the title \\"America's greatest dramatic actor\\" based on their body of work and the numerous accolades they have received throughout their careers. There is no universally agreed-upon method for determining who is the greatest dramatic actor, as personal opinions and tastes differ, and the field of acting is constantly evolving. Factors such as an actor's versatility, critical acclaim, box office success, and contributions to the craft of acting all contribute to the ongoing debate. In conclusion, it's impossible to say whether or not Billy Zane is America's greatest dramatic actor, as there is no definitive set of criteria for making such a determination, and opinions on this matter are highly subjective and varied. It's perhaps more appropriate to recognize his talent and acknowledge his contributions to the field of acting without attempting to place him above or below other talented actors."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Question: \\"At what point was there communication established with American 11 and was said?\\" Answer: \\"At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes.Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay.We are returning to the airport\\" Is this answer correct?

Humanism: Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science (see the history of science in the Renaissance). This was despite what A. C.

But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.

Here is a news article: \\"It is going to be something so important,\\" President Donald Trump said of the space force. | Alex Edelman/AFP/Getty Images Trump orders creation of a stand-alone Space Force President Donald Trump on Monday ordered the Pentagon to establish a stand-alone Space Force as a new branch of the armed forces. \\"We are going to have the Air Force, and we are going to have the Space Force, separate but equal,\\" Trump said at a meeting of the National Space Council at the White House. Story Continued Below \\"It is going to be something so important.\\" He also asked Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford to carry out the process of standing up the new military service. \\"Our destiny beyond the earth is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national security, so important for our military and people don’t talk about it,\\" Trump said. \\"When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in space.\\" The move quickly drew some backlash from one key senator, who said the president was overstepping his bounds by unilaterally calling for the creation of a new military service. \\"The president told a US general to create a new Space Force as 6th branch of military today, which generals tell me they don’t want,\\" Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), a former astronaut, wrote on Twitter. \\"Thankfully,\\" he added, \\"the president can’t do it without Congress because now is NOT the time to rip the Air Force apart. Too many important missions at stake.\\" Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) also pointed out that establishing a new military branch requires congressional action.

We still don’t know what a Space Force would do, who is going to be in it, or how much is it going to cost,\\" Turner said. \\"After we get the report that we required as a legislative body and the president signed off on, then this issue can be appropriately evaluated for what’s best for national security.\\" A Senate Armed Services Committee staffer confirmed the committee was not notified in advance that Trump would make his announcement. Other lawmakers, however, applauded the move, including two members of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee — Reps. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), chairman of the subcommittee and a long-time champion of breaking space missions out of the Air Force. \\"I am thrilled to have President Trump's continued support for this critical mission to help strengthen our national security,\\" Rogers said in a statement. \\"I look forward to working with the president to make this initiative a reality.\\" Jerry Hendrix, a vice president at the defense consulting firm Telemus Group, pointed out it took more than 10 years for the Air Force to be separated from the Army in 1947. So, establishing a Space Force is \\"a really steep hill to climb,\\" he said, but predicted the Trump administration could likely move it forward in as little as two years if it really pushed. Defense officials still have to work out the details, like how the new service will be funded and who will staff it. And Hendrix predicted the money and personnel will largely come from the Air Force, which oversees the majority of Pentagon space missions, but that all services could be called on to contribute. At the Pentagon, spokeswoman Dana White said the Defense Department will start work on a \\"deliberate process\\" to implement the president's order. \\"We understand the president's guidance. Our Policy Board will begin working on this issue, which has implications for intelligence operations for the Air Force, Army, Marines and Navy,\\" White said in a statement. \\"Working with Congress, this will be a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders.\\" During debate on the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill H.R. 2810 (115), Congress proposed creating a Space Corps within the Air Force, similar to how the Marine Corps resides within the Navy. But the measure failed to move forward, with lawmakers instead compromised by ordering the Pentagon to study how space should be organized within the Defense Department. The study is ongoing and a final report is due to Congress by the end of the year. The House's version of the fiscal 2019 National Defense Authorization Act H.R. 5515 (115) proposes the creation of U.S. Space Command, as a subordinate combatant command under U.S. Strategic Command. It's unclear if this plan will survive the conference process with the Senate and end up in the final bill. A stand-alone Space Force as a separate military service, which Trump proposed in March, is different from both of these congressional plans. \\"Space is a war-fighting domain, just like the land air, and sea,\\" Trump told troops in California then. \\"We may even have a Space Force, develop another one, Space Force. We have the Air Force, we'll have the Space Force.\\" Trump also announced the signing of a space policy directive Monday to make it easier for commercial companies to operate in space and mitigate the creation of more trash in orbit. Space Policy Directive-3 “seeks to address the challenges of a congested space environment,” said Scott Pace, executive secretary of the National Space Council. The document directs several federal agencies to act, including the Defense Department, which will continue to maintain an authoritative catalog of objects in space, and the Commerce Department, which will release information from that catalog to the public and help companies avoid collisions between assets in space. \\"We are modernizing out-of-date space regulations — they're way out of date. They haven't been changed in many, many years,\\" the president said. \\"Today, we're taking one more step to unleash the power of American ingenuity.\\" The directive also asks NASA to establish new guidelines to avoid the creation of new orbital debris and the State Department to work with international partners to put in place their own similar guidelines, as well as a space object registry. It puts policy in place to back up the changes announced by Vice President Mike Pence in April, Pace said in a telephone briefing with reporters. “It’s not going to happen overnight, but we’re getting everyone in their lanes and people pulling in the right direction,” he said. The goal of the reforms is to ensure that companies can do business in space with sufficient knowledge about where space assets currently are. It also ensures they don’t have to contend with too much debris — which can make operating difficult or cause collisions in the worst case scenarios. Pace said the effect of the directive on companies will hopefully be more rapid access to space traffic management information through a more “user-friendly” interface at the Commerce Department. It’ll also mean companies have to move their satellites out of the way of debris less often, he added, allowing them to conserve fuel to stay on mission longer. This is the third Space Policy Directive coming from the president. The first, which stated the national mission to return to the moon and focus on human exploration, came in December. The second, focused on cutting regulations on launch and commercial remote sensing, came in May. Trump emphasized the need to partner with the commercial sector on space, but criticized one of the government's biggest space contractors, United Launch Alliance, for being a partnership between two defense giants: Boeing and Lockheed Martin. \\"I don’t like when Boeing and Lockheed get together because the pricing only goes up, but that’s okay in this case,\\" Trump said while introducing United Launch Alliance CEO Tory Bruno. \\"I don’t know, I don’t love that stuff, we’re going to have to talk about that.\\" \\"Stay apart, stay apart, don't get together,\\" he said while introducing the CEOs of Lockheed Martin, Marillyn Hewson and Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg. United Launch Alliance was formed in 2006 by the two companies.

Too many important missions at stake.https://twitter.com/AP/status/1008749585735569409 … ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"On June 18, 2018, President Donald Trump ordered the Pentagon to establish a stand-alone Space Force as a new branch of the armed forces, separate but equal to the Air Force. Trump emphasized that American dominance in space is a matter of national security. He tasked Joint Chiefs Chairman, Gen. Joseph Dunford, with standing up for the new military service. Trump's move faced backlash from several senators who claimed the president doesn't have the authority to unilaterally create a new military service without Congress's approval. They cited potential risks to existing Air Force missions and ongoing plans to study space's organization within the Department of Defense before evaluating what's best for national security. Some lawmakers, however, supported the move, such as Reps. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), both members of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee. The Pentagon has been tasked with implementing Trump's order after carrying out a \\"deliberate process\\" with input from multiple stakeholders. It remains to be seen how the new service will be funded and staffed. The establishment of a Space Force could take years, as defense officials continue to work through the details and historical precedence. For example, it took over 10 years for the Air Force to be separated from the Army in 1947."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The modern English noun Greek (Old English Grecas or Crecas) is derived from the Latin Graeci, which in turn originates from Ancient Greek Graikos (Graikos). It seems that the word is related with the Greek word geron geron, \\"old man\\" (from the PIE base *gerh2-, \\"to grow old\\") via Proto-Greek *gera-, \\"old age\\"--also related to Mycenean Greek kera /geras/, \\"gift of honour\\". The Germanic languages borrowed the name with an initial k sound, which was probably their initial sound closest to the Latin g (Goth. Kreks). Aristotle used the term Graikos related with Hellenes (Meteorologica I xiv) and claimed that it was the name originally used by the Illyrians for the Dorians in Epirus from Graii native name of the people of Epirus. He places Ancient Hellas in the region of Achelous river around Dodona where in his opinion the great deluge of Deucalion must have occurred. The priests of Zeus in Dodona were called Selloi which could lead to Sellanes (like Akarnanes) and then to Hellanes-Hellenes. However the toponyms and the Greek tradition indicate that it is more possible that the homeland of the Greeks was originally in central Greece and that the name was probably Pre-Dorian. A Greek legend is referring to an older deluge of Ogyges in Boeotia, in the region occupied by the Minyans which are considered autochthonous or Proto-Greek speaking people. The region outside of Attica including Boeotia was called Graike and the word Ogyges related with ocean came to mean \\"from earliest days.\\" Homer is referring to Hellenes as a relative small tribe in Phthia in central Greece (Achaea Pthiotis). In the Parian Chronicle is mentioned that Phthia was the homeland of Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Graikoi (Graikoi). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Deucalion (who ruled around Phthia) and Pyrrha, the only survivors after the great deluge. Hesiod is referring to Graecus son of Pandora, who was sister of Hellen. Alcman mentions that the mothers of Hellenes were Graikoi. The German classical historian Georg Busolt (1850-1920) derives the name from Graikos,\\"inhabitant of Graea, a town on the coast of Boeotia. The name Graea (graia) is derived from Proto-Greek grau-j-, \\"old lady\\". Homer, while reciting the Boeotian forces in the Iliad's Catalogue of Ships, provides the first known reference to a region named Graea, and Pausanias mentions that the ancient city of Tanagra was for a time called Graea, adding that \\"no one knows where this Graia really was; Aristotle thought it was near Oropus, further east on the same coast as Delion.\\" Busolt claimed that the name was given by the Romans originally to the Greek colonists from Graea who helped to found Cumae the important city in southern Italy where the Latins first encountered the Greeks and then to all Greeks. According to Rene Olivier, in the French language the word grec (Greek) is sometimes also used as an ethnic slur meaning fraudster (in contrast with hellenique which has no negative connotations).

The film's producer Andrew Gunn said he initially hoped Jodie Foster (who played Annabel in the original 1976 Freaky Friday film) would be interested in playing the mother in the remake. She declined in order to spend more time with her family and because of concerns that the stunt casting would overshadow the film's overall merit. Annette Bening was then cast in the role, but dropped out because of family obligations. Jamie Lee Curtis was given the role only four days before filming began. Lindsay Lohan's character was originally written as a Goth, but she did not think anyone would relate to that, and decided to dress in a preppy style for her audition. The character ended up being rewritten. Marc McClure, who played Boris Harris, Annabel's love interest in the original film, has a brief cameo as Boris the delivery man. Director Mark Waters also makes a cameo holding a baby at the wedding. In the end scene when Anna is dancing with Jake, there is a woman in the background dancing with an older gentleman, and she looks directly at the camera. That is Lindsay Lohan's mother, Dina Lohan.

Context: For the past few weeks I have been talking about the merits of the Mediterranean Diet. However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all.

The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera. I didn't know it at the time, but at that moment Dylan Maxwell was sitting in front of a wall of monitors, laughing his ass off. Question: Why did the narrator try to flip off the camera? Options: A. He didn't like the company that made the cameras B. not enough information C. He was trying to create a distraction D. He realized that Dylan was not letting him in === The correct answer is A:","completion":"D. He realized that Dylan was not letting him in"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite his talent for drawing, he has never really noticed the true beauty of the world around him. One ordinary day, a captivating young woman named May stumbles upon Qiwu's street-corner workspace. Not only does she have a stunning appearance, but her personality is enchanting as well - a combination that captures Qiwu's attention like nothing else. Overcome with bashfulness, however, he struggles to strike up a conversation with her. During their brief meeting, Qiwu still manages to learn that May is an aspiring writer, currently working at a popular café to support her passion. She reveals to Qiwu that she's planning to go on a one-month sabbatical to finish her debut novel. Knowing she is leaving soon, Qiwu decides to muster the courage to ask May out on a date.

Question: suppose other internal changes underground happens, how will it affect MORE/GREATER eruptions. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's first consider the steps in the process of a volcanic eruption: 1. Magma rises from deep in the earth. 2. The magma goes into volcanos. 3. The volcanos pressure the magma upwards. 4. The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano. 5. The lava cools. 6. The lava forms new rock. 7. New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano. 8. The volcano bursts through the rock that formed after the last eruption. Now let's think about how other internal changes underground might affect the frequency or intensity of volcanic eruptions: A: More eruptions - If there are changes in underground processes that cause more magma to be generated or to rise more frequently, this could lead to more frequent eruptions. For example, increased tectonic activity might cause magma to rise and fill the volcano's chamber more quickly, leading to more frequent eruptions. B: Less eruptions - If the changes lead to a decrease in the amount of magma rising from deep in the earth or a decrease in the pressure pushing magma upwards, this could result in fewer or less intense eruptions. For example, if there is less tectonic activity or changes in the composition of magma that make it less likely to rise, the frequency of eruptions might decrease. C: No effect - Some changes in underground processes may not have a significant impact on the frequency or intensity of volcanic eruptions. For example, if the changes do not directly affect the generation, movement, or pressure of magma, it is possible that the number and intensity of eruptions would not be affected. Based on these considerations, I would choose Answer A: more eruptions as the most likely outcome of other internal changes underground affecting volcanic eruption frequency and intensity. However, it's important to remember that the actual impact of such changes would depend on the specific nature and scale of the changes in question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? you wo n't feel like it 's wasted yours","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"you won't feel like it's wasted yours\\" can be described as chiefly positive. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves gauging the subjective information in a text segment and categorizing it – typically into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Here, it is very important to understand the context of the sentence. On analyzing the sentence at face value, one can infer that the speaker is assuring someone that their time or effort will not be perceived as wasted. This assurance could relay a positive sentiment because it communicates a level of respect or conscientiousness toward the listener's investment, whatever that might be (time, effort, resources, etc.). It suggests the presence of meaningful or valuable outcome in the context that would justify the input provided. Therefore, in an overarching sense, the sentence carries a positive sentiment because it conveys hope, reassurance, or affirmation as perceived from the listener's perspective. The speaker is communicating an optimistic outcome or response in the existing context. Still, it's notable that sentiment detection can sometimes vary based on detailed contextual cues, cultural nuances, deeper pragmatics, or other variables. But based on the given sentence and absent any other contextual insights, we can reasonably deduce it as positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them, there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited, confusing, and unnecessary.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how a vul works Suggested answer: With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out. Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"No, the suggested answer is not accurate for describing how a Variable Universal Life (VUL) insurance policy works. The correct explanation for how a VUL works is as follows: A Variable Universal Life (VUL) insurance policy is a type of permanent life insurance that combines elements of both whole life and universal life insurance with added flexibility and investment options. It provides a death benefit to beneficiaries, as well as a cash value component that can be invested in various sub-accounts or funds with potential for growth. Here are the main components of a VUL policy: 1. Premium Payments: Policyholders have the flexibility to pay premiums at their discretion. However, there is usually a minimum required premium to keep the policy active. Premiums paid in excess of the cost of insurance and administrative fees will go into the policy's cash value component. 2. Death Benefit: The death benefit is the amount paid to beneficiaries in the event of the policyholder's death. There are typically two options for the death benefit – a fixed face amount or a face amount plus the cash value component. 3. Cash Value Component: This is the investment portion of the VUL policy. The cash value can be invested in various sub-accounts or funds, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. These investments come with an inherent level of market risk, and their performance will directly impact the cash value. Policyholders can also borrow or withdraw from the cash value, but this may affect the death benefit. 4. Flexible Premiums and Death Benefits: Policyholders have the flexibility to adjust premium payments and the death benefit within certain limits, depending on the policy's performance and the policyholder's financial needs. In summary, a VUL policy offers more flexibility and investment options compared to a typical whole life policy, but it may also come with additional risks due to the variable market performance of the investment component."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now answer this question: What nationality of people makes up a large portion of Southampton residents?","completion":"Southampton, a city located on the southern coast of England, is home to a diverse population. Based on the data provided in the article, which estimates the city's population to be around 236,900 in 2011, it can be deduced that a significant portion of Southampton residents are of Polish nationality. The sizeable Polish community in Southampton is estimated to have reached as high as 20,000 individuals, making them a notable demographic within the city's population. The presence of this large Polish group can be attributed to various factors, including historical events, economic opportunities, and social networks. Since World War II, a significant number of Poles have immigrated to the United Kingdom, seeking refuge, stability, and better living conditions. Particularly after Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004, the freedom of movement facilitated a considerable wave of Polish migrants seeking job opportunities in the UK. Southampton, with its bustling economy and seaport, has been an attractive destination for many Polish nationals. The strong Polish influence in Southampton is evident through the cultural establishments, businesses, and events that cater to the Polish community. Polish food shops, bars, and schools can be found in the city, along with community events such as the annual Polish Heritage Day, which celebrates and fosters connections between the Polish community and other residents in the area. In summary, the Polish nationality makes up a large portion of Southampton residents, with as many as 20,000 Polish individuals living within the city.

Tässä on englanninkielinen teksti käännettynä suomeksi: Haluaisin kiittää Euroopan parlamenttia tästä keskustelusta, joka käsittelee erittäin tärkeää aihetta nimittäin ympäristötarkastuksia. Ympäristötarkastukset ovat keskeinen osa tehokasta ympäristöpolitiikkaa ja laadunvalvontaa, minkä vuoksi on tärkeää, että tämä aihe saa ansaitsemansa huomion Euroopan parlamentissa. Ympäristötarkastukset auttavat varmistamaan, että ympäristölainsäädäntöä noudatetaan ja että ympäristöä kohdellaan kestävällä ja vastuullisella tavalla. Ne ovat myös tärkeä keino ehkäistä ja havaita väärinkäytöksiä ja riskejä, jotka voivat aiheutua ihmisten toiminnasta ympäristölle. Tällaisia riskejä voivat olla esimerkiksi vaarallisten aineiden päästöt, maaperän ja vesistöjen saastuminen sekä luonnonvarojen ylikäyttö ja lajien sukupuuttoon kuoleminen. Euroopan parlamentin rooli on valvoa ja ohjata EU:n toimielinten ja jäsenvaltioiden ympäristöpolitiikan toteuttamista, mukaan lukien ympäristötarkastusten käyttöönottoa ja kehittämistä. Sen vuoksi on ensiarvoisen tärkeää, että parlamentti keskustelee siitä, miten ympäristötarkastukset voidaan ottaa kattavammin ja tehokkaammin käyttöön koko EU:n alueella. Parlamentti voi esimerkiksi keskustella ja tehdä ehdotuksia siitä, kuinka ympäristötarkastusten resursseja ja koulutusta voidaan parantaa jäsenvaltioissa, sekä siitä, millaisia yhteistyömekanismeja ja tiedonvaihtoa voitaisiin kehittää eri toimijoiden välille. Lisäksi parlamentti voi vaikuttaa siihen, kuinka heikkoja kohtia, kuten petoksia ja väärinkäytöksiä, voitaisiin torjua tehokkaammin ympäristötarkastusten avulla. Toivottavasti tämä keskustelu auttaa luomaan entistä vahvempaa yhteistyötä ja yhteisymmärrystä ympäristötarkastusten merkityksestä ja siitä, kuinka niitä voidaan kehittää ja hyödyntää EU:n ympäristöpolitiikan täytäntöönpanossa. Sen myötä voimme edistää yhdessä kestävämpää tulevaisuutta ja varmistaa, että ympäristöarvojamme suojellaan parhaalla mahdollisella tavalla."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the rest of the story on Guardian News Added January 20, 2017 from Guardian News Can we infer the following? He stepped down after being president for 28 years","completion":"The story suggests that Yahya Jammeh has stepped down as the president of The Gambia, making way for Adama Barrow to assume office. It is important to note that Yahya Jammeh was a long-term leader in The Gambia, allowing us to infer that he served as president for a substantial period. However, the specific duration of his presidency is not provided in the given text. To provide a more accurate and detailed response, Yahya Jammeh served as the President of The Gambia from 1994 to 2017. He originally came into power after leading a successful military coup in July 1994, which ousted then-president Dawda Jawara. Jammeh's time in office spanned over 22 years, during which his rule was characterized by accusations of human rights abuses, suppression of political dissent, and electoral malpractices. During the December 2016 presidential election, the opposition leader Adama Barrow emerged as the winner. Initially, Jammeh conceded defeat and congratulated Barrow on his victory. However, he later reversed his decision, claiming that the electoral process was marred by irregularities. This led to a political crisis in the country, with international pressure mounting on Jammeh to accept the results and step down. The situation escalated when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a regional bloc of which The Gambia is a member, intervened and deployed military forces to ensure a smooth transition of power. Diplomatic efforts were also intensified, leading to the involvement of several presidents from neighboring countries that engaged in negotiations with Jammeh. These combined efforts eventually convinced him to step down on January 20, 2017. This marked the end of Jammeh's rule and allowed the internationally recognized President, Adama Barrow, to take over. In conclusion, while the specific duration of Jammeh's presidency is not provided in the text, a comprehensive examination of his time in office reveals that he served as the leader of The Gambia for approximately 22 years."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Gather the ingredients and utensils Christine collected the necessary items, including a box of strawberry flavored jello mix, water, a measuring cup, a mixing bowl, and a spoon. She thought these would be sufficient for making the delicious and wobbly dessert. Step 2: Read and follow the instructions on the jello mix box Christine carefully read the instructions on the back of the jello mix box, making sure she understood the steps and measurements to avoid any mistakes. The instructions stated that she'd need the jello mix, one cup of boiling water, and one cup of cold water. Step 3: Boil water Christine filled a pot with water and turned on the stove to bring it to a boil. As the water heated up, she observed the temperature closely to ensure it was a perfect rolling boil. Step 4: Mix the jello powder with boiling water Once the water boiled, Christine carefully measured out one cup of the boiling water and poured it into the mixing bowl. Next, she slowly added the strawberry flavored jello mix and began stirring it with the spoon. She continued stirring until the powder was fully dissolved. Step 5: Add cold water and refrigerate After the jello mix was fully dissolved, Christine measured out one cup of cold water and gently added it to the bowl, stirring it well to combine everything. Then, she covered the bowl with plastic wrap and placed it in the refrigerator to set. The box instruction said it would take about 4 hours to set, so Christine made a mental note to check on it later.

The jello was wobbly and had a bright, visually appealing strawberry color. Christine smiled, proud of her work, and proceeded to scoop a portion of the jello into a bowl for Maria.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -8*l = 3*l + 55 for l, we need to isolate the variable l on one side of the equation. Here's the step-by-step solution: Step 1: Move all terms with the variable l to one side of the equation. To do this, we can add 8*l to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -8*l term on the left side and move all the l terms to the right side. The equation becomes: -8*l + 8*l = 3*l + 55 + 8*l Which simplifies to: 0 = 3*l + 8*l + 55 Step 2: Combine the l terms on the right side of the equation. 3*l and 8*l have the same variable, so we can combine them. The equation becomes: 0 = 11*l + 55 Step 3: Move the constant term to the other side of the equation. Now we want to isolate the term with the variable (11*l) by moving the constant term (55) to the other side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 55 from both sides: 0 - 55 = 11*l + 55 - 55 Which simplifies to: -55 = 11*l Step 4: Solve for l. Finally, we want to find the value of l by dividing both sides of the equation by 11: -55 / 11 = (11*l) / 11 This simplifies to: -5 = l So the solution to the equation -8*l = 3*l + 55 is l = -5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Attorneys... (Associated Press) The fatal shooting of Jones, 55, and 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, a college student visiting his father for the holiday, at a West Side home has raised further questions about a police department already under intense scrutiny. Grieving relatives and friends of the two victims gathered Sunday to remember them and criticize city officials who they said had once again failed residents. The shooting happened early Saturday morning at the small two-story home, where Jones lived in a ground-floor apartment and LeGrier's father in an upstairs unit. Police, who were responding to a 911 call made by LeGrier's father after an argument with his son, have released few details beyond a brief statement. It said that officers \\"were confronted by a combative subject resulting in the discharging of the officer's weapon\\" and added that Jones \\"was accidentally struck.\\" Both Jones and LeGrief were black, and their deaths come amid scrutiny of police after a series of deaths of African-Americans at the hands of officers across the country gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. It also comes amid a federal civil rights investigation into the Chicago Police Department that was launched after last month's release of police dashcam video showing white officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times in 2014. Police did not disclose the race of the officer or officers, saying only that those involved will be placed on administrative duties. LeGrier's mother, Janet Cooksey, during a vigil Sunday placed candles on the porch of the home. On either side of the door, Post-It notes indicated where two bullets hit siding on the house. \\"I used to watch the news daily and I would grieve for other mothers, other family members, and now today I'm grieving myself,\\" Cooksey said at a news conference outside the residence earlier Sunday. Others who spoke said police should have used stun guns or other nonlethal methods if they felt they needed to subdue LeGrier. \\"Why do (police) have to shoot first and ask questions later?\\" Jacqueline Walker, a friend of Jones, asked. \\"It's ridiculous.\\" Family spokesman Eric Russell said Jones' many grandchildren had hoped to thank her for their Christmas gifts over the weekend. Autopsy findings released Sunday by the Cook County medical examiner's office say Jones died from a gunshot to the chest and LeGrier from multiple gunshot wounds. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi on Sunday said only that the shootings are being investigated by the city's Independent Police Review Authority, the main police oversight agency. LeGrier's cousin, Albert Person, said LeGrier's father had invited his son to a holiday gathering at another home on Christmas. Person said the son's refusal to go caused friction, but he downplayed the severity of the argument. \\"What family doesn't fight on the holidays?\\" he said. LeGrier's father, Antonio LeGrier, told the Chicago Sun-Times his son appeared to be a \\"little agitated\\" when the father returned to the apartment. Around 4:15 a.m., the elder LeGrier said he heard loud banging on his locked bedroom door and that his son said, \\"You're not going to scare me.\\" He said his son tried to bust the door open, but he kept him from doing so and called police. He added that he called Jones on the floor below to say his son was a \\"little irate\\" and not to open the door unless police arrived. He said Jones told him his son was outside with a baseball bat. Person said the teen was back in the house by the time police arrived. When they did arrive, Antonio LeGrier said he heard Jones yell, \\"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\\" He said he heard gunshots as he made his way down from the second floor and then saw his son and Jones lying in the foyer. He said his son had emotional problems after spending most of his childhood in foster care. He described him as a \\"whiz kid\\" on break from Northern Illinois University, where he majored in electrical engineering technology. Cooksey denied that her son ever exhibited \\"combative behavior.\\" She said he \\"might've been angry with his father and they might've got into it,\\" but that he was not angry or violent. It's not clear whether Jones tried to intervene before being shot or if she was hit by gunfire while answering the door. Sam Adam Jr., a lawyer for the Jones family, said Jones and LeGrier were apparently shot near the doorway of the home, but that shell casings were found some 20 feet away. He said that raised questions about whether police could have perceived LeGrier as a threat at such a distance. It couldn't be independently verified that the casings had any link to Saturday's shooting. Adam also said police took the hard drive of a home-security camera from across the street, but it was unknown if it or other cameras in the neighborhood captured the shootings. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office said in a statement Saturday that IPRA would share its evidence with the county prosecutor's office. \\"Anytime an officer uses force the public deserves answers, and regardless of the circumstances, we all grieve anytime there is a loss of life in our city,\\" Emanuel said in the statement. ||||| As questions grow about a police-involved shooting where a 55-year-old bystander was killed, the City of Chicago announced what the mayor’s office called “two significant policy steps,” related to police shootings and procedures for interceding in domestic violence situations. NBC 5's Phil Rogers reports. (Published Monday, Dec 28, 2015) As questions grow about a police-involved shooting where a 55-year-old bystander was killed, the City of Chicago announced what the mayor’s office called “two significant policy steps,” related to police shootings and procedures for interceding in domestic violence situations. Saturday morning, 55-year-old Bettie Jones was shot and killed in a flurry of gunfire directed at a 19-year-old-man armed with a baseball bat at a two story home on Chicago’s west side. That man, Quentonio LeGrier, also died, shot seven times. “She didn’t do anything to nobody,” said Jones’ daughter Latisha. “All she did was answer her front door!” Chicago Police have given few details about the incident, saying that the officers were responding to a 911 call made by LeGrier’s father, after an argument with his son. Police said in a statement, that arriving officers were confronted by a “combative subject resulting in the discharging of the officer’s weapon,” and that “the female victim was accidentally struck.” “I feel like I just want to wake up and have my mom say, ‘Girl, that was a dream,’” said Jones daughter Latarsha. “But I can’t. She’s gone. She was murdered.” Effective immediately, the city says officers involved in shootings will be removed from street duty for a minimum of 30 days while those shootings are investigated. “I was really pleased to see that,” said Sharon Fairley, the acting chief of the Independent Police Review Authority, the agency responsible for investigating police shootings. “I definitely think that’s a step in the right direction.” Fairley acknowledged public dissatisfaction with the length of time many police shooting investigations can take. But she defended her agency’s work, saying it was most important that those investigations were done correctly. “These matters are always serious,” she said. “These investigations can be extremely complex, and there can be valid reasons that they can be extended in time.” At the same time, Fairly acknowledged that she is stepping into leadership at IPRA, at a time when public outrage over police shootings may be at an all-time high. “It’s a lot of pressure, there’s no question,” she said. “Stepping into this job at this time in this firestorm, it certainly isn’t easy. But I have to put all that aside and focus on the work and getting the work done.” Attorney Sam Adam Jr., who represents Jones’ family, questioned why it was necessary for police to fire at a subject armed only with a baseball bat. “The shell casings, many of them, are found down by the street on the sidewalk, which would suggest that is at least 25 feet away,” Adam said. In an obvious reference to the domestic investigation where the two were shot early Saturday morning, the mayor’s office announced in a statement Monday that the city would embark on a complete review of crisis intervention policies. “The Mayor has called on them to determine the deficiencies in the current training or policies,” that statement said, “and outline what steps can be taken immediately to address them.” Emanuel’s office announced Monday he was cutting a Cuban vacation short, to return to Chicago and manage the latest crisis confronting his Police Department. Fairley would not comment specifically about the investigation into the Saturday morning shootings, emphasizing instead, that she has embarked in a top to bottom review of her agency and its investigations into allegations of police wrongdoing. “I’m not about finger pointing,” she said. “What I’m focused on, is how are we going to fix it? What are the policies and procedures and training that we can put in place, to get the ship going in the right direction?” ||||| A definitive statement from the Chicago Police Department about an officer's fatal shooting of two people — one by accident — came Saturday night, 16 hours after the incident. But when it did arrive, the comments from interim Superintendent John Escalante were notable. In the late-evening press release, Escalante not only announced a major policy shift on returning officers to duty after a shooting, he also took the unusual step to acknowledge that an innocent victim had been hit by an errant police bullet. \\"The 55-year-old female victim was accidentally struck and tragically killed,\\" the statement read. \\"The department extends its deepest condolences to the victim's family and friends.\\" In contrast, the 2012 department statement on the fatal shooting of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd, who was also an unintended target of a police shooting, simply noted that a female had \\"sustained a gunshot wound.\\" Both the policy announcement and Escalante's condolences reflect the emerging reality for the Chicago Police Department in the wake of last month's release of video of a white police officer fatally shooting an African-American teen. The disturbing 2014 dash-cam video showed 17-year-old Laquan McDonald carrying a pocket knife and walking away from Officer Jason Van Dyke, who shot 16 rounds at the teen within seconds of arriving at the scene and now faces first-degree murder charges. The video, which was released only after a judge's order, has led to swift — even dizzying — changes. The U.S. Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into excessive force. Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy was fired, and the head of the independent agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct was forced out. Mayor Rahm Emanuel publicly apologized. The shooting about 4:30 a.m. Saturday in the 4700 block of West Erie Street was the department's first lethal use of force since the McDonald video was released, providing a glimpse of how it is responding to the biggest crisis of Emanuel's tenure in office. Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Sunday that Escalante and his command staff had started working on the policy change a week and a half ago. But in the wake of learning details from the West Side shooting, Escalante insisted the statement acknowledge the accidental killing of Bettie Jones, Guglielmi said. Chicago police fatally shot Quintonio LeGrier, 19, and Bettie Jones, 55, as officers responded to a domestic disturbance at a West Garfield Park residence Dec. 26, 2015, authorities said. \\"It was a tragic loss of life. The superintendent was adamant that the department express our deepest condolences,\\" Guglielmi said. \\"... The climate we are in is causing us to look at this. We are really trying to make the department better.\\" In the Saturday shooting on Erie, Harrison District officers were responding to a domestic violence call of a man wielding a bat. Police shot and killed Quintonio LeGrier, a 19-year-old engineering student, after he became combative with them, the Chicago police statement said. During the altercation, Bettie Jones, 55, a mother of five who lived downstairs from LeGrier's father, was shot and killed by accident. Hours after the West Side incident, Chicago police were involved in yet another shooting, though this one nonfatal. At 1:30 p.m. in the 1000 block of West 103rd Place, officers confronted a man with a gun, leading one officer to open fire, wounding the man. Such confrontations with the public are the focus of the Justice Department civil rights investigation, which was announced earlier this month by U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The probe will include a detailed examination of how and when officers use force in the department, as well as how the city investigates the incidents. The investigation was prompted by the McDonald shooting but comes after years of civil lawsuits against the department and outcries from the public over police-involved shootings. The review is expected to be lengthy, taking at least a year, and will likely lead to a court-enforced consent decree demanding systemic reforms. Recommended changes could cover anything from training to how firearm discharges are recorded and documented in the department. But Chicago doesn't have to wait for the Justice Department review to address problems, and Escalante has already made some moves aimed at restoring public confidence. Soon after Escalante took over as interim superintendent, he announced a policy change on dashboard cameras. Because there was missing audio in the dashboard cameras from responding vehicles the night of McDonald's shooting, Escalante has sent out inspectors on random checks to see if the dash cams are working property. If an inspector finds that an officer didn't tell a supervisor about a faulty camera, that officer could be disciplined. Then on Saturday night, the interim superintendent announced another policy change: Officers involved in shootings will be shifted to mandatory administrative duty, returning to their assigned bureau for desk duty for 30 days. The new policy includes the officer or officers involved in Saturday's shooting, according to the police statement. That is a big shift from the current policy in which officers generally had three days to see a counselor and be cleared for return to duty unless it was determined that they need more time off. Officers were also required to report for a one-day retraining at the academy — though that could happen after they returned to duty. During the newly established 30-day period, the officer will be required to attend the training class at the academy, commanding officers will monitor and evaluate if the officer is prepared to return to street duties, and the officer will have to see a department counselor. Guglielmi said Escalante reviewed other cities' departments and settled on the 30 days because \\"it seemed like a fair amount of time to get all those objectives done.\\" Providing officers with time off following a shooting is not unusual. It is considered essential to making sure an officer is coping with any psychological issues in the aftermath of the incident and is getting whatever support he or she needs. Getting the proper help for officers is not an easy task in a profession where admitting weakness has historically been frowned upon. ||||| Tensions remain high in Chicago after police shot and killed two people early Saturday morning, with the force already faces heightened scrutiny overs its practices. Janet Cooksey says her 19-year-old son, Quintonio LeGrier, was a college honors student studying engineering who recently had been dealing with some mental health issues, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner. Family members reportedly called police to their home Saturday because the teen was threatening his father with a baseball bat. Detectives described LeGrier as being \\"combative\\" before he was shot. \\"I used to watch the news daily and I would grieve for other mothers, other family members, and now today I'm grieving myself,\\" said Janet Cooksey, LeGrier's mother. \\"When do it come to an end?\\" Fifty-five-year-old Bettie Jones, a mother of five, lived in the same building. She was reportedly waiting for police to respond, then got shot along with LeGrier. Police admitted she was quote \\"accidentally struck and tragically killed.\\" \\"Right now is a time for compassion towards the suffering of families that are experiencing injustices throughout our city,\\" Jahmal Cole, a Jones relative, said Sunday at a press conference. The frustration felt by this community comes amid protests over a string of deadly police shootings. Video released recently showed the death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, shot by officer Jason Van Dyke 16 times in October of 2014. The officer faces criminal charges. On Sunday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel called for a review of how police are trained to respond to mental health issues in a crisis.

An Oklahoma City Police Department spokeswoman tells PEOPLE Aubrey McClendon, 56, was driving his 2013 Chevy Tahoe at a \\"high rate of speed\\" Wednesday morning when the vehicle left the roadway, colliding head-on with a wall. Police believe McClendon died instantly, but claim it is too early to tell if the accident was intentional. (McClendon was part-owner of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder.) \\"We need to wait for the results of his autopsy before we can comment on motivation,\\" the spokeswoman says. \\"The accident could have been caused by a medical episode.\\" Photos from the accident scene indicate McClendon's car burst into flames upon impact, the spokeswoman says. The accident is still under investigation, she says. According to Tuesday's indictment, McClendon allegedly orchestrated a conspiracy between two large oil and gas companies to not bid against each other for the purchase of certain oil and natural gas leases in northwest Oklahoma. During this alleged conspiracy, which ran from December 2007 to March 2012, authorities say McClendon and his alleged co-conspirators would decide ahead of time who would win the leases. The winning bidder would then allegedly allocate an interest in the leases to the other company. \\"While serving as CEO of a major oil and gas company, the defendant formed and led a conspiracy to suppress prices paid to leaseholders in northwest Oklahoma,\\" said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer in a statement. \\"His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land.

The perturbation you mentioned is related to sediment transportation and has no direct or indirect impact on the life cycle of a butterfly. Therefore, the correct answer from the given options is: - not impacting any step of the process This is because sediment transportation is a geological process, whereas the butterfly life cycle is a biological process. While it's possible that cocoon formation and sediment transportation may co-occur in the same ecosystem, they do not influence each other in a way that would impact the steps in the butterfly's life cycle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While we know that the airport currently does not have any taxiways other than the one leading to the terminal building, the provided information does not mention any plans for future development or expansion of the airport's infrastructure. In order to determine if the statement follows the preceding text, more information would be needed about any plans for construction or renovation at Diqing Shangri-La Airport. It is essential to know if the airport authorities have announced any plans to build additional taxiways or address the current backtaxi situation, as well as whether the necessary funding and regulatory approvals have been secured. Moreover, even if we were to assume that there are plans to construct more taxiways at the airport, predicting a precise timeline of completion such as \\"next year\\" also requires access to more detailed information about the execution of such projects. These factors include the construction timeline, potential challenges, environmental regulations, and any other contingencies that may affect the progress of the work. In summary, the statement \\"Diqing Shagri-La Airport will have more than one taxiways next year\\" cannot be confirmed or refuted given the information provided in the preceding text.

Chan A:","completion":"Title: Dark Vendetta Genre: Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller Plot Summary: In a dystopian future, the edge of society struggles for survival within the confines of a sprawling city ruled by law and order under the iron hand of elite Judge Dredd. When a mysterious attacker, Chan, wages a relentless cat-and-mouse game against Dredd, it puts the entire city in peril as the two adversaries uncover a deadly conspiracy. Act 1: The film opens with a high-speed chase through the ever-bustling Mega-City One, a massive metropolis that covers almost the entire eastern seaboard of the United States. Judge Dredd, the city's most feared law enforcer, is pursuing a well-known arms dealer. The criminal is subdued with merciless efficiency, and the people of the city breathe a sigh of relief. With the status quo restored, Dredd returns to the Hall of Justice to report his success. Act 2: Meanwhile, in the dark underbelly of the city, a mysterious figure lurks, studying Dredd's movements and patterns. This shadowy being harbors an unparalleled hatred for the elite Judge and meticulously plans his attack. Soon, the stranger, known only as Chan, reveals himself to be a genetically superior assassin, capable of out-smarting and out-fighting Dredd. Chan's relentless attacks on Dredd and brutal acts against the citizens of Mega-City One leave the Judges crippled and frightened. As their power wanes and panic envelops the city, a task force led by Judge Anderson, an empathic psychic judge, is assigned to track Chan down. Act 3: In an unexpected twist, Dredd discovers traces of manipulation deep within the Hall of Justice. The investigation leads to the exposure of a high-ranking judge who has been secretly orchestrating the incidents in an attempt to seize control of the city and establish a new governing order. The revelation forces Dredd and Anderson to ally themselves with Chan. Act 4: The climax begins with a heated battle between Dredd, Anderson, and Chan against the corrupted Judicatory forces. As they fight their way through the once hallowed halls, Dredd and Chan form a mutual respect for one another, in spite of their past vendettas. They eventually come to confront the supreme antagonist, the high-ranking judge, unveiling a ruthless and twisted plot that affects not only the city but many others. In an explosive finale, Dredd, alongside Anderson and Chan, eliminates the threat posed by the rogue judge and dismantles the deep-rooted conspiracy that shakes Mega-City One to its core. Act 5: With the city saved and the corrupt judge brought to justice, Dredd and Chan begrudgingly exchange glances and nods of respect before parting ways. Anderson, still wary of Chan, warns him that she will be watching him closely. As Chan solemnly leaves the city, Dredd and Anderson contemplate the events, knowing that they must work together to rebuild the city and restore the public's faith. This dramatic film confronts themes of power, betrayal, honor, and redemption, offering a new perspective on a struggle between a classic comic book character and a complex new enemy, all enveloped within an intriguing suspenseful thriller."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Szekely (born September 12, 1967), better known by his stage name Louis C.K. (), is an American stand-up comedian, writer, actor, and filmmaker. He is known for his use of observational, self-deprecating, dark, and shock humor. In 2012, C.K. won a Peabody Award and has received six Primetime Emmy Awards, as well as numerous awards for The Chris Rock Show, Louie, and his stand-up specials Live at the Beacon Theater (2011) and Oh My God (2013). He has won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album twice. In August 2005, C.K. starred in a half-hour HBO special as part of the stand-up series One Night Stand. Inspired by the work ethic of fellow comedian George Carlin, who had committed to dropping all of his existing material and starting over every year, In June 2006, C.K. starred in and wrote Lucky Louie, a sitcom he created. The series premiered on HBO and was videotaped in front of a studio audience; it was HBO's first series in that format. Lucky Louie is described as a bluntly realistic portrayal of family life. HBO canceled the series after its first season. He appeared in three films in 2008: Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins, Diminished Capacity, and Role Models. C.K. launched his first hour-long special, Shameless, in 2007, which aired on HBO and was later released on DVD. In March 2008, he recorded a second hour-long special, Chewed Up, which premiered on Showtime Network on October 4, 2008, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy or Variety Special. C.K. and his wife Alix Bailey divorced in 2008, with C.K. and Bailey sharing joint custody of their children. In a 2010 interview, C.K. talked about how, after his divorce, he thought, \\"well, there goes my act.\\" He alluded to the way that his marriage had been central to his act and his life, and he said that it took him approximately a year to realize \\"I'm accumulating stories here that are worth telling.\\" One element in his preparation for stand-up was training at the same boxing gym as Lowell, Massachusetts fighter Micky Ward, trying to \\"learn how to ... do the grunt work and the boring, constant training so that you'll be fit enough to take the beating.\\" On April 18, 2009, C.K. recorded a concert film titled Hilarious. Unlike his previous specials--which had all been produced for television networks--Hilarious was produced independently, directed by C.K. himself, and sold to Epix and Comedy Central after it was complete. As a result, it was not released until late 2010. It was published on DVD and CD in 2011. It is the first stand-up comedy film accepted into the Sundance Film Festival. From 2009 to 2012, C.K. played Dave Sanderson, a police officer and ex-boyfriend of Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) in the sitcom Parks and Recreation. He also co-starred in the romantic comedy fantasy film The Invention of Lying, directed by and starring Ricky Gervais, in 2009.

Pick the answer from these options Possible answers: -Change the data to support the hypothesis.; -Perform the experiment without using control groups.; -Make observations and form another testable hypothesis.; -Perform the experiment using a larger number of variables.;","completion":"The most appropriate step to take when an experiment results in data that do not support the hypothesis is to make observations and form another testable hypothesis. When the data obtained from an experiment does not support the initial hypothesis, it typically indicates that the hypothesis may not accurately describe or explain the phenomenon being studied. It is essential to maintain scientific integrity and honesty by acknowledging that the original hypothesis might need revision, rather than attempting to manipulate the data or experiment design to force a desired outcome. In such cases, researchers should carefully analyze the data and the experimental process to identify any potential flaws in the methodology or any additional factors that may have influenced the results. By making observations based on the data obtained and the underlying scientific principles, they can then formulate a new, testable hypothesis that better accounts for the observed phenomena. Once a new hypothesis has been formed, the next step is to design another experiment to test it. This may involve modifying the experimental design, redefining the variables or stimuli used, or revisiting assumptions made during the initial hypothesis formation. It is important to learn from previous experiments and to refine approaches in light of the new information. In conclusion, when experimental data does not support a hypothesis, the most suitable course of action is to make observations based on the obtained data and form another testable hypothesis. This approach ensures that the scientific process remains objective, rigorous, and focused on uncovering true understanding of the natural world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It had not rained in almost a month. The crops were dying. Cows had stopped giving milk. If it did not rain soon, we would lose everything. On this day, I witnessed a wonder. I was making lunch when I saw my 6-year-old son, Billy, walking very slowly toward the woods. Minutes later he came running out again, toward the house. Soon after, I saw him walking toward the woods again. This went on for an hour. Finally I walked out of the house quietly and followed him. Billy cupped both hands in front of him as he walked, careful not to drop the water he carried. Leaves slapped his face but he kept walking into the woods. Then I saw an amazing sight. Several large deer stood in front of him. Billy walked right up to them. I saw a tiny baby deer lying on the ground. It was dying of thirst, and it lifted its head with great effort to drink the water in my boy's hands. When the water was gone, Billy ran back to the house. I followed him to the tap. Billy opened it and a small trickle came out. He knelt down, letting the drops slowly fill up his \\"cup\\". Now I understood what was going on. The week before, he tried giving water to our horses but I told him not to waste water. Now when he stood up and turned, I was there in front of him. His eyes filled with tears, \\"I'm not wasting,\\" he said. I joined him with a small pot of water from the kitchen. I let him walk to the baby deer alone while I stood at the edge of the woods.

A:","completion":"The writer thought of their son, Billy, as a caring, helpful, and persevering individual who, despite being told not to waste water, understood the importance of offering assistance to the baby deer.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions? , can you please find it? In July 1873 the U.S. Navy dispatched USS Juniata to Greenland, to search for survivors from the Polaris expedition which had disintegrated after the death of its leader, Charles Francis Hall. Juniata's second-in-command was George W. De Long, a 28-year-old graduate of the United States Naval Academy, making his first visit to the Arctic. Ice conditions prevented Juniata from advancing beyond Upernavik; De Long volunteered to take the ship's tender, a small steamer named the Little Juniata, in the hope of finding survivors at Cape York, a further 400 nautical miles (740 km) north.The attempt failed; Little Juniata faced extreme weather conditions, and was forced to retreat a few miles from Cape York. De Long returned to Juniata in mid-August, having found no trace of the Polaris crew—who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler SS Ravenscraig—but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast in a letter to his wife Emma as \\"a dreary land of desolation ... I hope I may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place\\", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma wrote: \\"The polar virus was in his blood and would not let him rest\\".The abortive Little Juniata mission brought De Long to public notice, and he saw himself as a possible leader of the next U.S. Arctic expedition. He approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions. Grinnell was not prepared to offer financial support, instead advising De Long to approach James Gordon Bennett Jr., owner and publisher of the New York Herald and a known sponsor of bold schemes. De Long met Bennett in New York early in 1874; the newspaperman was impressed by De Long, and assured him that his Arctic ambitions would have the enthusiastic support of the Herald. In the meantime De Long had applied to the Navy Department for an Arctic command, a request that he was informed would \\"receive due attention\\".

Context: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The area will hold up to 230 vehicles - in effect a two-and-a-half mile queue. Mrs May said 8,000 migrant attempts to cross the Channel to the UK were foiled between 21 June and 11 July, when ferry strikes in France exacerbated problems. Transport bosses said migrant numbers in Calais had risen from 600 in January to 5,000 - and that figure was growing. Mrs May told the Commons hauliers had been subjected to \\"repeated attempts by illegal migrants who attempt to stow themselves away in their vehicles\\". The new zone should provide protection for lorries and their drivers by \\"removing them from the open road where they can become targets for migrants\\", said Mrs May. She said the security zone should \\"transform protection\\" for hauliers. Her announcement came as transport bosses appeared before the Home Affairs Committee to answer questions about the crisis. Kent Police Chief Constable Alan Pughsley told MPs there had been a \\"significant increase\\" in the number of migrants found hiding in vehicles in the UK over the past month. He said: Mr Pughsley said he believed strike action by French ferry workers during that time was a \\"contributing factor\\" to the numbers because it meant \\"easier access\\" for people to trains or lorries. John Keefe, director of public affairs at Eurotunnel, said the 5,000 figure had grown from an estimated 600 migrants in January, and the rise was \\"continuing apace\\". \\"We have never seen numbers like this before and we have not in the past seen the degree of organisation that goes with the numbers either,\\" he said. He said a secure zone would not solve the issue, adding: \\"As soon as you remove an opportunity, the organised criminals who are managing the migrant attacks are moving to the next opportunity - to the next weak spot.\\" Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett said the situation was \\"out of control\\" and criticised the fact the secure zone would not be in place until the autumn. \\"This isn't fast enough. We've got drivers being threatened with bars and knives. We've had an example of a driver being threatened with a gun,\\" he said. \\"We've got a problem right now. This is unprecedented and it's escalating. We need action now.\\" The \\"write-off\\" of products due to contamination by migrants entering vehicles could be £1bn a year, he said, adding: \\"There are full loads that are being destroyed.\\" Last week a migrant from Eritrea died attempting to board a freight shuttle headed to Britain. The death came days after about 150 migrants tried to storm the Channel Tunnel terminal in France. The strike by French ferry workers at the end of last month forced the suspension of Channel Tunnel services. It closed the Port of Calais and resulted in thousands of lorry drivers being stuck on the roads into Calais. This led hundreds of migrants to try to board UK-bound lorries. Mrs May said British and French authorities had been working together for months to improve security at Calais. Some £12m will spent on work to reinforce security in northern French ports, including new fencing and work to improve traffic flow and Border Force controls, which would be completed next month, she said. Other security measures already announced include a £2m upgrade of detection technology, £1m extra for dog searches and new fencing in Calais. UKIP's migration spokesman, Steven Woolfe, said the government was \\"waking up to the crisis\\" but called for more UK border personnel in Calais and said the UK should negotiate a scheme where migrants can be returned immediately to France if they have entered the UK illegally. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Britain's border was the scene of a \\"terrible crisis\\" where lives were being lost and people were being injured. Summary:","completion":"There are many cars and trucks going between the UK and France. Some people called migrants want to go to the UK, but they don't have permission.

By Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia The Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory is a party divided again today with Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, refusing to attend all meetings, after an alleged homophobic slur against his son by Deputy Chief Minister Dave Tollner. Parliamentary colleagues have confirmed Mr Higgins' stance. He's informed party officials that he does not want to present at future meetings where Mr Tollner be in attendance. According to the NT News, the territory's Deputy Chief Minister is accused of calling Joshua Higgins a 'pillow biter' and 'shirt lifter'. Scroll down for video Three of the party's indigenous members quit the party, pushing Mr","completion":"Tollner's leadership into further turmoil. Tensions have risen between various factions of the Country Liberal Party as they grapple with the fallout from this scandal. Gary Higgins' decision to boycott all meetings where Tollner is present highlights the deep-rooted animosity and mistrust within the party that threatens to undermine its overall unity and effectiveness. The situation is further complicated by the fact that three indigenous members, who contributed significantly to the party's diversity and representation, have chosen to quit the party in the wake of this controversy. Their resignation has not only created a significant vacuum in the party's leadership but also raised questions about the party's commitment to inclusivity and upholding the values it claims to represent. In the light of these developments, it is clear that the Country Liberal Party must take immediate steps to address this crisis and repair the damage caused by the alleged homophobic remarks of the Deputy Chief Minister. The party leadership could consider initiating mediation between Mr. Higgins and Mr. Tollner in an attempt to resolve the dispute and heal the rift within the party. Furthermore, party officials should seriously consider implementing a code of conduct or sensitivity training for all party members in order to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. Moving forward, the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory must also focus on restoring the trust of its constituents and proving that it remains committed to representing a diverse range of interests and viewpoints. This can be achieved through transparent and open communication with the public, combined with a demonstrated effort to promote diversity within the party's ranks. In conclusion, the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory is currently dealing with a significant challenge as a result of the alleged homophobic remarks made by the Deputy Chief Minister, Dave Tollner. This incident has caused deep divisions within the party and led to the resignation of several members, including Joshua Higgins' father, Member for Daly, Gary Higgins. In order to regain the trust of its members and the wider public, the party must take decisive action to address this scandal, promote diversity and foster an inclusive environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where does Andrew meet the Gallini family traveling circus? Andrew Larabee teaches at a school run by his headmaster father Matthew, a traditional man who disapproves of his son's unconventional methods despite their popularity with the students. Andrew's special interest is archaeology, and he hopes to earn his father's respect through this field of study. During the school holidays, Andrew bicycles to ancient ruins in Sussex where he believes a statue of Pan (which had been left behind by a Roman legion) can be found. Such a discovery would enable him to publish and subsequently wed Letitia Fairchild, his fiancée of five years, who insists he earn a promotion before she marries him. At the site he encounters the Gallini family traveling circus, which has been ordered to pack up and leave by the local police since the land is now property of dairy farmer Lord Elmwood. The five Gallini brothers and their cousin Selena mistake Andrew for a contractor, and when he tells them he doesn't mind if they remain, the Gallinis halt their \\"pulling up stakes\\". Lord Elmwood arrives and threatens to remove both Andrew and the circus, but Andrew realizes he's a former fellow Oxford University student with a checkered romantic past. Chastened by Andrew's subtle threat of blackmail, Lord Elmwood agrees to give Andrew and the Gallinis a week before he starts construction on the land.

They are observing the speed of the particles in the gases to see how fast they are moving. Gas A has particles moving very quickly, but Gas B has particles that are hardly moving at all. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which gas is at a lower temperature? Hint: We discussed earlier some basic principles about the behavior of gases called the kinetic-molecular theory. Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed.","completion":"Based on the information provided and the hint about the kinetic-molecular theory, we can determine that gas with particles moving more slowly is at a lower temperature. In this case, that would be Gas B. The kinetic-molecular theory states that gas molecules are constantly in motion, and the speed of the individual gas particles depends on the temperature. A higher temperature corresponds to faster molecule movement, while a lower temperature results in slower molecule movement. In the given scenario, Gas A has particles that are moving very quickly, which indicates that it is at a higher temperature. On the other hand, Gas B has particles that are hardly moving, which suggests that it is at a lower temperature. This principle can also be applied to liquids and solutions, where a temperature increase leads to an increase in the average particle speed. Understanding the relationship between temperature and particle speed is crucial in many scientific applications, including heat transfer, chemical reactions, and even weather patterns. Scientists use the kinetic-molecular theory and its related principles to study and predict the behavior of various substances and phenomena under different temperature conditions. In conclusion, Gas B is at a lower temperature in comparison to Gas A, as it has particles that are hardly moving at all. This observation is consistent with the kinetic-molecular theory, which posits that the average speed of gas particles directly correlates with temperature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: when was hong kong given back to china?","completion":"Hong Kong, a region with an intriguing and complex history, was handed back to China on July 1, 1997. This significant event marked the end of British colonial rule that had lasted for over 150 years and signaled the beginning of Hong Kong's reunification with mainland China. The roots of Hong Kong's colonization can be traced back to the First Opium War, which occurred between 1839 and 1842. This conflict, mainly due to the dispute over British trade and China's sovereignty, ended with the signing of the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The treaty saw China ceding the island of Hong Kong to the United Kingdom in perpetuity. Later, following the Second Opium War, the Kowloon Peninsula was ceded to Britain via the Convention of Peking in 1860. Lastly, in 1898, the British and Chinese governments signed the Second Convention of Peking, granting Britain a 99-year lease of the New Territories, comprising areas north of Kowloon Peninsula and various surrounding islands. Over the years, as Hong Kong experienced significant growth and underwent rapid development, it emerged as a global financial and trade hub. Under British rule, the region had thrived on the principles of free market capitalism, rule of law, and limited government interference. However, the expiration of the 99-year lease in 1997 posed a challenge for the British administration. Recognizing that Hong Kong's New Territories were pivotal to the region's prosperity, both in economic and geographical terms, the British government entered into negotiations with China regarding the future of Hong Kong. In 1984, the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed, which stipulated that Hong Kong would be returned to China on July 1, 1997. The declaration also introduced the concept of \\"One Country, Two Systems,\\" allowing Hong Kong to retain its capitalist economy, legal framework, and political structure for 50 years after the handover. To facilitate this arrangement, the Hong Kong Basic Law was drafted, serving as a mini-constitution for the region, effective from the handover date. Thus, on July 1, 1997, amidst a grand transfer ceremony, attended by international dignitaries such as China's President Jiang Zemin and Britain's Prince Charles, Hong Kong officially transitioned from British rule to Chinese sovereignty and became the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The title is a certificate that you should have received from the dealer, probably after you paid off all the loans. The title will name the rightful owner or owners of the vehicle. Once you have confirmed that you possess the title and are the legal owner of the vehicle, you can proceed with gifting it to someone else. Follow these steps to complete the process: 1. Transfer the title: To gift the vehicle, you will need to transfer the title to the recipient. This process typically involves completing a title transfer form, which is available at your local DMV or vehicle registration office. Fill out the required information, including the vehicle's VIN, your personal information, and the recipient's information. Both you and the recipient must sign the form. If there are multiple owners listed on the title, all owners must sign the transfer form. 2. Remove the license plates: You will need to remove the license plates from the vehicle before giving it away. Typically, you will keep the plates and surrender them to your local DMV or motor vehicle agency. The recipient will need to obtain new plates for the vehicle when they register it under their name. In some cases, the license plates may be transferable, depending on your state's specific regulations. 3. Complete a bill of sale (if required): Some states require a bill of sale as part of the vehicle transfer process. The bill of sale typically includes information about the car, such as the make, model, year, and odometer reading. It also lists the names and addresses of both the buyer and seller (in this case, the recipient and you). Finally, it describes any terms of the sale or gift, and both parties must sign it. Check with your state's DMV website to see if a bill of sale is necessary. 4. Report the gift to your state's motor vehicle agency: Depending on your state, you may need to report the gift to the appropriate agency. This typically involves completing a gift declaration form with the vehicle's information, your information, and the recipient's information. Both parties must sign the declaration. 5. Provide the recipient with all appropriate paperwork: Once the title transfer form, bill of sale (if required), and gift declaration (if required) are completed and signed, provide the original documents to the recipient. Make sure to keep copies of all documents for your records. 6. The recipient registers the vehicle: The final step is for the recipient to take all of the completed paperwork to their local DMV or motor vehicle agency to register the vehicle under their name. They will need to pay any applicable registration fees and obtain new license plates if the plates were not transferable. By following these steps, you can successfully gift a vehicle and ensure that the new owner has the proper documentation to register and operate the vehicle legally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

PUBLISHED:. 08:30 EST, 30 April 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:15 EST, 30 April 2013. It seems there is only one thing more irritating than the rotund opera singer from the Go Compare TV commercials – any attempt to do away with him. Two commercials where the character was attacked drew more complaints than any other to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) last year. The Italian character, Gio Compario, created by Welsh singer Wynne Evans, was designed to be deliberately annoying as he repeatedly blasted out the company jingle. Scroll down for videos. An ad showing Go Compare's opera-singing character Gio Compario being kicked in the stomach by Stuart Pearce generated over 1,000 complaints. Opera singer Gio Compario lies injured on the ground. Viewers complained the ad was potentially harmful to children. Stuart Pearce as he appears in the ad. Unsurprisingly, the price comparison website thought the nation would welcome a series of creative and funny efforts to wipe him off our TV screens. However, it appears many were upset by the dastardly comic book methods they came up with. The first commercial featured former England left back, Stuart Pearce, who is famous for his hefty left foot, aiming a football at the annoying Gio. More than 1,000 people complained that kicking a football into the singer’s stomach was likely to set a bad example to children. The ASA disagreed, insisting most people would understand it was light-hearted and comical. The second commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the character in a bid to kill him off. This time there were 797 complaints from people who were unhappy at the suggested violence. Again the ASA backed the company, saying the images were clearly meant to be a joke, while Gio was unharmed. The two commercials feature at the. top of a list of the ten most complained about advertisements of 2012 in. the watchdog’s annual report published today. In. third place was a more serious advertisement by Channel 4 for its. controversial series, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, which was deemed to have. sexualised a teenage girl. The poster showed the 15-year-old. blonde, who was heavily made up, spilling out of a low cut top that. revealed her breasts and cleavage. The. broadcaster was also criticised over a second poster of a 10-year-old. boy with an aggressive expression which was deemed to have stereotyped. youngsters from the traveller community. One commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the Go Compare character in a bid to kill him off. The watchdog’s annual report reveals that it rejected the vast majority of the 31,298 complaints received about 18,990 ads last year. Among those to be cleared were images of a naked rambler character in a TV ad for Richmond ham, which provoked complaints from more than 300 viewers that it was unsuitable to be seen by children. Asda came under fire last Christmas for a commercial that suggested the job of preparing for the festivities was essentially woman’s work. Women complained it promoted sexist stereotypes while men, including Fathers for Justice, were unhappy that it failed to recognise the value of dads. However, the ASA sided with the supermarket which produced research showing that mums really do carry the burden of organising Christmas. The organisation received more than 300 complaints about advertisements on the YouTube channel of the Paddy Power betting firm, which poked fun at transsexuals. It could not make a ruling as the firm is based in Ireland, however it did censure the firm over a similar commercial that appeared on British TV. Surprisingly, the St John’s Ambulance was responsible for one of the most controversial advertisements of the year. Its TV ad showed a man and his family coping with his diagnosis, treatment and eventual recovery from cancer, only for him to die by choking to death on a piece of food. More than 144 complained, however the ASA ruled the strong storyline was justified because it carried an important message that relatively simple first aid techniques can prevent a tragedy. Other commercials in the top ten, included a Morrisons ad where a dog was apparently being fed Christmas pudding, which might be harmful, and a Kellogg’s cereal ad which some thought was distressing because it showed a man being attacked by a snake. The ASA partly upheld complaints about a TV ad for the Kayak Software Corporation which showed a man receiving brain surgery. Some viewers thought the theme was distressing. The watchdog’s work led to just 3,700 ads being changed or withdrawn last year. Its chairman, Lord Smith, the former Labour Culture Secretary, said: ‘We want to make sure that consumers aren’t being misled, misinformed, harmed or offended. ‘They need to be able to make proper, informed choices about what products and services are available to them. And we want to make sure that there is a fair comparison between advertisers, so that responsible marketing isn’t being under-cut by the irresponsible.’ 1.

Kerry Foods Richmond Ham, (371 complaints, upheld in part)Naked. rambler viewed as upsetting for children. Criticism of nudity rejected. Claim that meat was ‘Britain’s only ham’ was misleading. A naked rambler in a Kerry Foods ad for Richmond Ham was criticised for potentially upsetting children. 5. Paddy Power (Transsexual theme, 311 complaints, out of remit)Commercial on YouTube channel made fun of transsexuals. No ruling as company registered in Ireland. A Paddy Power ad with a transsexual theme angered viewers, who lodged over 300 complaints, but no ruling was made as the company is registered in Ireland. 6. Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut cereal (234 complaints, not upheld)Man attacked by snake as he tried to capture it in kitchen. A Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal ad generated 234 complaints by people who were alarmed by the sight of a snake attack on a man in his kitchen. 7.

It highlights that the album was released by the label \\"Furious\\" in the United Kingdom and by the label \\"7 Spin Music\\" in the United States.

Given the question \\"What is the relationship between the two speakers?\\" and the answer \\"They are strangers.\\", write a conversation that might have happened. Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Introduce the two speakers For a conversation between two strangers, it is important to create a scenario where they have a reason to engage in conversation. A common setting for this interaction could be a public place, such as a bus stop or a coffee shop. Step 2: Initiate the conversation One of the speakers will need to initiate the conversation by asking a question or making an observation about the surroundings. The other speaker should respond in a manner that suggests they are open to conversation, despite being strangers. Step 3: Exchange basic information In order to demonstrate that the two speakers are strangers, they should briefly exchange some basic personal information. This should be kept minimal, as strangers typically divulge little about themselves. Step 4: Display informal politeness and curiosity Since the speakers are strangers, they should exhibit a level of politeness in their conversation. The tone should remain casual and any inquiries about each other should remain surface-level. Step 5: End the conversation The conversation should come to a natural close, ensuring that it remains clear that the two speakers were strangers when they first started talking. It's important to maintain the sense that they have just met and maintain their stranger status. Based on these considerations, here is a sample conversation: Speaker 1: \\"Excuse me, do you know when the next bus is supposed to arrive?\\" Speaker 2: \\"I think it should be here in about 5 minutes.

Write the answer: At which university did British spies Burgess, Blunt, Maclean and Philby meet?","completion":"British spies Guy Burgess, Anthony Blunt, Donald Maclean, and Kim Philby, collectively known as the \\"Cambridge Five,\\" met at the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England. The University, founded in 1209 and boasting a rich history of academic excellence, unknowingly became the breeding ground for some of the most notorious double agents of the 20th century. The Cambridge Five were recruited by Soviet intelligence during the 1930s while they were studying at the University of Cambridge. The University had a strong intellectual tradition, with many leftist groups and associations active on its premises. This created a milieu in which radical and progressive ideas could take root among the students, presenting Soviet intelligence with an opportunity to seek potential recruits who were sympathetic to the communist cause. Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, and Kim Philby studied at Trinity College, one of the largest and most renowned of the colleges at the University of Cambridge. Meanwhile, Anthony Blunt pursued his education at the same university but attended Trinity Hall College. These young men developed ties with the British establishment, becoming part of the bureaucratic machinery that made critical decisions during and after World War II. It is important to note the different years of enrollment at the University of Cambridge for each member of the Cambridge Five. Burgess began his studies in 1930, Philby in 1932, Blunt in 1931, and Maclean in 1934. Despite these differences in their enrollment years, they all shared left-leaning political ideations and intellectual curiosity which ultimately led to them forging connections during their time at the University. While it is not known exactly when and under which circumstances they all met, it is apparent that their association at the University of Cambridge was instrumental in the formation of this notorious spy ring. Throughout their careers, the Cambridge Five provided valuable information to the Soviet Union, betraying the British intelligence service MI5, MI6, and the Foreign Office. Their actions allowed the Soviet Union to stay informed on important Anglo-American strategies and secrets, significantly impacting the course of global events during the early stages of the Cold War. In conclusion, the University of Cambridge was the pivotal meeting place for the British spies Burgess, Blunt, Maclean, and Philby. The nurturing environment of intellectual and political exploration at one of the world's most prestigious educational institutions allowed these young men to forge strong relationships and align their ideals with the Soviet cause. This ultimately led to the creation of one of the most infamous spy rings in history, the Cambridge Five, whose actions had a profound impact on international relations during their time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Переведем как \\"длинношерстных\\" и \\"короткошерстных\\". - precedent - это прецедент, что значит что-то важное и первый раз происходит, на русском это будет \\"прецедент\\". Теперь соберем все части вместе: 1991 год - АЛК (CFA) предоставляет временный статус для длинношерстных и короткошерстных кошек - устанавливается прецедент в CFA. Это перевод, но мне кажется, что для пятилетнего ребенка это может быть все еще сложно. Поэтому простыми словами можно сказать так: В 1991 году, в специальной организации для кошек, решили признать длинношерстных и короткошерстных кошек. Это было важное и первое такое решение."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Read the below conversation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: When Darrell Issa goes fishing Darrell Issa is about to reach a regrettable milestone. The California Republican is one summons away from issuing his 100th subpoena since becoming chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee in 2011 — all of them without a committee vote and the vast majority without the concurrence of the committee’s ranking Democrat. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation’s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000. The “unilateral subpoenas,” as they are known, are a departure from the way the committee has conducted its investigations for decades and an echo of the late Clinton years, when conspiracy-minded Chairman Dan Burton fired off more than 1,000 subpoenas (including one to the wrong man because of mistaken identity) and established his investigative bona fides by shooting a melon to reenact the death of Clinton friend Vince Foster. The careless use of the subpoena — the power to compel a witness’s appearance or the production of documents — has discredited Issa’s chairmanship by politicizing his probes from the start. His unilateral style has also been a leading contributor to the overall toxicity in politics by turning his committee into a forum for partisan clashes over Benghazi, Libya, the Internal Revenue Service and Eric Holder’s Justice Department. The latest showdown will come Wednesday: Senior White House official David Simas has been ordered by Issa, under a unilateral subpoena, to testify about political activities Issa alleged are illegal. In recent weeks, Issa has issued two unilateral subpoenas to compel the testimony of Secretary of State John F. Kerry over Benghazi, and another subpoena to force the testimony of the IRS commissioner (even though the official had offered to testify voluntarily.) This is not what the oversight committee was supposed to be. Though it has long bestowed unilateral subpoena power on the chairman, the committee didn’t issue a single unilateral subpoena from the 1950s until the mid-1990s, according to Phil Schiliro, who served as the committee’s Democratic staff director for a decade beginning in 1997. In the eight years after Burton’s chairmanship, virtually all of the 78 subpoenas issued (under Republican Chairman Tom Davis and Democratic Chairmen Henry Waxman and Edolphus Towns) were done either with the minority’s consent or with a committee vote. Davis and Waxman managed to cooperate even on highly charged matters such as the Jack Abramoff and Pat Tillman investigations. “Henry and I had an exceptional relationship,” Davis told me. “It’s the way it ought to work.” Schiliro said 43 of Waxman’s 46 subpoenas were issued with Davis’s consent, and the other three were put to a vote. The act of justifying a subpoena to the committee “forces collaboration,” he said, and “goes to whether there is a legitimate investigation or not.” Issa’s deputy staff director, Frederick Hill, said Democrats as well as Republicans have used unilateral subpoenas. Hill also said that Issa, unlike his immediate predecessor Towns, consults with the minority before each subpoena. Without the minority’s signoff and without even a public debate on the merits of a subpoena, the unilateral subpoena is a way to float allegations in lieu of investigative spade work. This generates complaints about “fishing expeditions” from those who receive the subpoenas — and counter accusations of “cover-ups” when an administration resists. Issa’s Benghazi probe has been typical of this approach. He used his subpoena with a heavy hand: He ordered Ambassador Thomas Pickering, who led an administration probe into the Benghazi attacks, to submit to a private interview, even though Pickering had volunteered to testify publicly. Issa coupled that with unfounded allegations, declaring his “suspicions” that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the Pentagon to “stand down” rather than help Americans in Benghazi. Likewise, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) , vying to succeed Issa as chairman next year, said he found it “disgusting” that a special operations team was “told to stand down” rather than assist in Benghazi. But declassified testimony released last week by the House Armed Services Committee disproved such allegations. Military officials up and down the chain of command testified — voluntarily — that they received rapid approval to mobilize assets during the attack and that two quick-reaction teams had been alerted for deployment. The head of a four-man team in Tripoli that was allegedly told to stand down testified that he received no such order and that his orders to remain in Tripoli rather than fly to Benghazi were “instrumental” in saving the life of a wounded American evacuated from Benghazi. Armed Services Chairman Howard “Buck” McKeon (R-Calif.), whose committee conducted a more responsible Benghazi investigation than Issa’s, says he’s “pretty well been satisfied that . . . we probably couldn’t have done more than we did.” The testimony should satisfy Issa too — if his real purpose is to answer questions and not to issue subpoenas.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Neurodegenerative diseases represent one of the main causes of disability and dependence in elderly individuals, and it is predicted that the number of people suffering from dementia could double by 2020. Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by the gradual and progressive loss of neurons in the brain, which results in impairments in cognitive, motor, and sensory functions. These diseases can have a severe impact on the quality of life of the affected individuals, their families, and healthcare systems. Some of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The exact cause of these diseases is still not fully understood, but several factors have been identified, including genetic predispositions, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Common symptoms include memory loss, confusion, disorientation, and difficulties in carrying out daily tasks. Parkinson's disease is primarily a movement disorder that involves progressive degeneration of the part of the brain that controls movement. The most common symptoms are tremors, muscle stiffness, and slowness of movement. It can also lead to cognitive and psychological problems. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The immune system attacks the protective coating of the nerves, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, and problems with coordination and balance. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rapidly progressive neurological disease that involves the degeneration of nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscles. People with ALS may experience muscle weakness, slurred speech, and difficulty swallowing and breathing. The increasing prevalence of these diseases has significant implications for healthcare systems, governments, and societies worldwide. The need for research to develop new treatments and potentially prevent these diseases is urgent, as the global population continues to age, and the number of people affected by neurodegenerative diseases is expected to rise dramatically. As the statement mentions, it is anticipated that the number of people living with dementia could double by 2020, highlighting the importance of addressing this growing issue. Although there is no cure for most neurodegenerative diseases, early diagnosis and interventions can help improve the quality of life of those affected and potentially slow the progression of the disease. This highlights the need for public health initiatives to support early detection, improve patient care, and invest in research and development to find new treatments and potential future solutions for these debilitating conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Q: What are are segmented invertebrates in phylum annelida called? Choices: - flatworms - fungi - corals - annelids A: The answer is:","completion":"Annelids Segmented invertebrates found in the phylum Annelida are called annelids. To provide a comprehensive understanding of annelids, let's delve into their characteristics, classification, and some examples. Characteristics of Annelids: 1. Body segmentation: Annelids exhibit metamerism, which is the division of their body into multiple, similar segments (called metameres) that are lined up in a linear fashion. This segmentation provides flexibility and improved locomotion. Each segment has a coelom, an internal body cavity filled with fluid. 2. Bilateral symmetry: These organisms display bilateral symmetry, meaning that their body can be divided into two equal and identical halves through a vertical plane. 3. Muscular system: Annelids possess a well-developed muscular system, consisting of both longitudinal and circular muscles. These muscle layers help in contracting and expanding the body segments, allowing for efficient movement. 4. Nervous system: Annelids have a central nervous system that consists of a brain (cerebral ganglia) and a ventral nerve cord running along the length of the body. 5. Body covering: The outer body surface of annelids is covered with moist, permeable skin, which facilitates gas exchange and sometimes even bears external structures like bristles, known as chaetae or setae. 6. Reproduction: Annelids can reproduce both asexually through regeneration and sexually through gamete production. Most annelids are hermaphroditic, meaning that one organism possesses both male and female reproductive organs. Classification of Annelids: The phylum Annelida is subdivided into three main classes: Polychaeta, Oligochaeta, and Hirudinea. 1. Polychaeta: This class includes marine worms, commonly known as bristle worms. Polychaetes have a well-developed head region with sensory organs and frequent parapodia (fleshy, lateral extensions) on each body segment, which bear chaetae. Examples: Nereis (clam worm), Arenicola (lugworm), Aphrodite (sea mouse), and Sabella (feather-duster worm). 2. Oligochaeta: This class consists of earthworms and some freshwater worms. Oligochaetes lack well-developed head structures and parapodia. Their chaetae are small and simple, and they mostly live in burrows within soil or sediments. Examples: Lumbricus terrestris (common earthworm), Tubifex (sludge worm), and Eisenia fetida (red wiggler). 3. Hirudinea: Leeches belong to this class. They have a flattened body, no chaetae, and typically possess suckers on both anterior (mouth) and posterior (ventral) ends, which they use to attach to their hosts during blood-feeding. Examples: Hirudo medicinalis (medicinal leech) and Haemopis (horse leech). In conclusion, the segmented invertebrates in phylum Annelida are called annelids. They exhibit distinct characteristics such as body segmentation, bilateral symmetry, well-developed muscular and nervous systems, and moist skin covering. Annelids can be further classified into polychaetes, oligochaetes, and hirudineans, each with unique morphological features and preferred habitats."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"The natural aggregation of work activities and tasks performed for program delivery.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Work activities include administrative and management tasks.\\"?","completion":"If we assume that the premise \\"The natural aggregation of work activities and tasks performed for program delivery\\" is true, we can analyze it in terms of the hypothesis \\"Work activities include administrative and management tasks\\" to determine the relationship between these two statements. First, let's break down the premise: 1. Natural aggregation - this suggests that the process of grouping together work activities and tasks is inherent and not artificially imposed. 2. Work activities and tasks - these relate to the specific actions and assignments carried out in the process of program delivery. 3. Program delivery - this involves successfully executing a plan, project, or initiative according to its intended purpose. Based on these components, the premise implies that there is an innate tendency for work activities and tasks to naturally group together, leading to the efficient execution of a program. Now, let's consider the hypothesis: 1. Work activities - this overlaps with the premise, referring to actions and assignments carried out in the process of program delivery. 2. Administrative and management tasks - these are specific types of work activities that involve organizing, coordinating, and overseeing resources, processes, and people to achieve program delivery goals. Connecting the premise with the hypothesis, we can infer that if work activities naturally aggregate for program delivery, and if administrative and management tasks are types of work activities, then including these tasks within the natural aggregation supports the efficient execution of a program. To further delve into this relationship, we must examine the roles of administrative and management tasks in program delivery. Administrative tasks usually involve activities like record-keeping, documentation, scheduling, communication, and procurement. These are essential in maintaining the structure and organization that guides a program towards its objectives. Management tasks, on the other hand, involve decision-making, goal-setting, resource allocation, delegation, team coordination, and monitoring performance. These tasks are crucial in ensuring that the program stays on track, adapts to any changes, and achieves its intended outcomes. Considering that administrative and management tasks are integral to successful program delivery, it is reasonable to assume that they are part of the natural aggregation of work activities and tasks. Without these tasks, the program would likely lack the necessary structure and direction, leading to inefficiencies and potential failure. In conclusion, if we accept the premise that there is a natural aggregation of work activities and tasks for program delivery, and given the importance of administrative and management tasks in this process, it is indeed valid to infer that the hypothesis, \\"Work activities include administrative and management tasks\\" holds true. Efficient program delivery requires not only the execution of tasks related to the program's core objectives but also the presence of supportive work activities such as administration and management to ensure a well-organized, coordinated, and goal-oriented approach."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The scene continues with the intensified sound of clanging weights, a testament to the strenuous workout the pair of men are undertaking. Sweat beads are dripping off their foreheads, highlighting the effort they're pouring into lifting their respective weights. They're lost in their workout routine, focused only on their desired results. They exhale heavily with each lift, the only sound of life in the otherwise still weight room. The man on the chair is taking his rest, his gaze fixed on his companion struggling with his barbell. Suddenly, the door swings open on its hinges and a third man walks in. His eyes are shining with determination, and his muscular body leaves no doubt of his capabilities. He carries an air of visible confidence. The resonating echo of the door closing behind him snaps the two men to attention from their exercises. The newcomer spots the heavy barbell, and his eyes glimmer at the challenge. It's the kind of weight a professional would handle, and with a glance between the two men, he steps up to the mat. The standing man, his arms now shaking noticeably, sets the bar back down and moves aside. Now, it is the man from the door who is standing on the mat about to jerk the bar. The newcomer then attempts the weight and struggles at first. His arms shake slightly under the pressure, and his breaths become deeper and heavier. However, it's clear that the newcomer is not willing to give up. With an audibly determined grunt, he powers through the resistance and raises the weight in the air. The two men watched with awed expressions as the weight that previously seemed unmovable now levitates under the impressive strength of the newcomer. Yet, with a soft cry of surprise, the bar slips from his grip and clatters back onto the mat, causing the room to shudder. To lighten the mood, the second man steps onto the mat, now clear of the fallen weights. Amused grins appear on the faces of his companions as he begins doing lift lifts in front of them, his muscles flexing with well-practiced ease. However, wanting to add a dash of surprise into his exhibit, the man suddenly leaps up and does a flip mid-air. The feat is met with widened eyes, promptly turning into impressed confirmation. The room is subsumed with hearty laughter, breaking the room's previously intense atmosphere with light-hearted camaraderie. In the end, all three men bond over their shared passion for strength training. This unexpected encounter becomes the starting point of a shared companionship through strenuous workout sessions, heartfelt encouragement in the face of challenges, and an occasional show-off of their amazing physical feats.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose relationship with Shostakovich's was tender? Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.)

Both are well-known and talented comedic actors who have the ability to carry the film and appeal to a wide variety of audiences. The movie also has a competent crew, including the director, scriptwriters, and production team, which contributes to the overall quality of the film. 3. Box office potential: Given its popular genre, talented cast, and engaging storylines, Brewster's Millions has the potential to perform well at the box office. Comedy films generally have mass appeal, and this particular movie has a charming and intriguing plot that should keep audiences interested and entertained. 4. Distribution and marketing: The success of a movie also heavily depends on its distribution and marketing strategy. If the film can secure a good distribution deal, it will have greater visibility and reach, resulting in higher ticket sales and revenue. Additionally, a well-planned marketing campaign will create buzz and generate interest among potential viewers, leading to an increase in demand for the movie. 5. Risk vs. reward: As with any investment, there is some level of risk involved. Investing in the film industry can be unpredictable, with some movies unexpectedly becoming huge blockbusters, while others fail to make a mark. It's essential to weigh the potential risks against the potential rewards and decide if the investment aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. To answer the initial question about who has no concept of money, at the beginning of the film, it could be argued that Monty Brewster has a limited understanding of money as he is not wealthy and has never been placed in a position of handling a vast sum. However, throughout the movie, he learns valuable lessons about the value of money, responsibility, and the importance of maintaining relationships. Based on these factors, as an investor, you should carefully consider the genre, target audience, cast, crew, box office potential, distribution, marketing, and overall risk vs. reward before making a decision on whether or not to invest in this film proposal. Reviewing these aspects will give you a clearer picture of the movie's potential success and help you make a well-informed investment decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Soren, a young barn owl, lives in the Tyto Forest with his family: his father, Noctus; his mother, Marella; his older brother, Kludd; his younger sister, Eglantine; and Mrs. P, the family's nest maid, a kindly blind snake. Soren enjoys listening to the 'Legends of Ga'Hoole,' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother's dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren's natural branching ability. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a Tasmanian devil but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt. Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young elf owl who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or 'pickers'. When Soren and Gylfie protest, they are sorted as pickers while Kludd, who betrays Soren, is sent to be a soldier. Soren and Gylfie avoid being 'moon-blinked' (a catatonic state induced by sleeping under a full moon), while the others do not know and become moon-blinked. They are forced to 'pick' through owl's pellets, scouring for bits of metal 'flecks', which are being used to build a superweapon. They are spotted by Grimble, a boreal owl, who reveals that he works under the Pure Ones only to keep his family safe and that he isn't really a Pure One at all. He teaches them to fly, but Nyra finds out whilst coming to invite Soren to become a soldier. Kludd decides to stay behind and become a Pure One, despite Soren's pleas for him to come with him. Grimble... My question: Who defeats Grimble in battle? A:","completion":"Grimble, the Boreal Owl who had been reluctantly serving the Pure Ones in order to protect his own family, is ultimately defeated in battle by Nyra. Nyra is a formidable owl who is one of the leaders of the Pure Ones, a group of owls seeking to cause disruption and chaos. When Grimble is caught teaching Soren and Gylfie how to fly - counter to the Pure Ones' intentions - he is exposed as a traitor. In hopes of creating a distraction to allow Soren and Gylfie to escape, Grimble enters into a fight with the Pure Ones. For the Boreal Owl, this act is a final opportunity to resist the oppressive force he has been forced to serve. During the ensuing battle, Nyra, who had earlier discovered Grimble's act of treason, confronts and fights him. Despite his bravery and skills, Grimble is overmatched by Nyra. It illustrates the twisted values of the Pure Ones and underscores the high stakes for anyone who seeks to oppose them. It also makes a hero out of Grimble for his courageous act of sacrifice, further deepening the tragedy of his defeat. Thus, the demise of Grimble serves as a turning point in the story, sparking further motivation for Soren and Gylfie in their mission against the Pure Ones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who did Sam hire to impersonate Gloria? Movie title: Body Double Movie plot: Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is a struggling actor who has lost his role as a vampire in a low-budget horror movie after his claustrophobia thwarts shooting. After returning home to discover his girlfriend cheating on him, he is left without a place to stay. At a method acting class he meets Sam (Gregg Henry) who closely monitors Scully's revelation of his fears and the childhood cause of his claustrophobia. They go to a bar where Scully is offered a place to stay; Sam's friend has left town temporarily and needs a house-sitter for his ultra-modern home in the Hollywood Hills. During the tour of the house with Scully, Sam is especially ecstatic about one feature: a female neighbor, Gloria Revelle (Deborah Shelton), who erotically dances at a specific time each night. Sam has even set up a telescope which Scully cannot resist using voyeuristically to watch her. One night he sees Gloria being abused by a boyfriend. When she goes shopping the next day, Scully decides to follow her. Gloria makes calls to an unknown person promising to meet them. Scully also notices a disfigured \\"Indian,\\" a man he had noticed watching Gloria a few days prior. Scully follows her to a seaside motel where apparently Gloria has been stood up by the person she was there to meet. On the beach the Indian suddenly snatches her purse. Scully tries to pursue him but in a nearby tunnel his claustrophobia restrains him and Gloria walks him out of it. They begin to impulsively and passionately kiss before she retreats. That night Scully is again watching through the telescope when the Indian returns. The man is seen breaking into Gloria's home. Scully races to save her but is attacked by Gloria's vicious dog. Gloria is brutally murdered by the Indian with a huge handheld drill. Chemosphere, the ultramodern house used in Body Double Scully is then left to alert the police, who assume it was simply a fumbled robbery.

Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Question: suppose the climate warms happens, how will it affect MORE fossils forming. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"Climate change, specifically global warming, can have a significant impact on the formation of fossils. By increasing the planet's average temperature, various environmental alterations can occur, affecting the processes that lead to fossilization. Therefore, the answer is neither A, B, or C because global warming could both increase and decrease fossil formation in certain areas, depending on several factors. Here is a more detailed explanation: 1. Impacts on animal and plant population: Warmer climates might alter the distribution of flora and fauna in different ecosystems. In some cases, a higher concentration of organisms in specific areas may increase the chances of fossil formation. However, for sensitive species that cannot adapt to new environmental conditions, population decline can lead to reduced fossil generation. 2. Changes in deposition environments: Climate change can bring about alterations in sea levels, precipitation patterns, and sedimentation rates. If sea levels rise, there might be more opportunities for organisms to be preserved in marine sediments, potentially boosting fossil formation. However, the locations and circumstances under which this might occur will not be uniform – in some places, erosional forces could dominate, wiping away any potential fossils. 3. Flood events and rapid burial: The increasing occurrence of extreme weather events could lead to more instances of mass mortality, resulting in the quick burial of numerous organisms. Such rapid entombment can create ideal conditions for fossilization. However, it is essential to recognize that such circumstances might not contribute to a sustained increase in fossils, but pockets of exceptionally preserved specimens in the geological record. 4. Decomposition rates: Warmer temperatures can also affect the rate of decomposition for plant and animal remains. In some cases, higher temperatures might speed up the process, decreasing the likelihood of fossil formation. However, in environments where a combination of factors inhibits decomposition (e.g., low oxygen levels in the sediment), the aforementioned influence might not play as significant a role. 5. Shifts in vegetation: Climate-driven changes in vegetation can impact the preservation potential of organic remains. For instance, forests reducing in size, undergoing transformation, or experiencing species turnover might lead to different rates and types of fossilization in terrestrial environments. In conclusion, the increased rate of global warming can influence fossil formation in numerous ways. The actual impact on the number of fossils created is complex and can vary depending on factors such as population dynamics, sedimentation rates, and environmental changes. Hence, it is challenging to classify the overall impact as more, less, or no effect – instead, the relationship between global warming and fossil formation is both intricate and spatially varied."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE For decades, Hollywood producer Bob Weinstein appeared to live in the outsize shadow of his older brother, Harvey. Harvey Weinstein was the public face of the studios they co-founded, a fixture on the Oscar circuit and a major player in Democratic political circles. Bob Weinstein, by contrast, seemed to shy away from the glare of fame. \\"My style is more low-key. Outside of the movie business I tend to be known as the 'quiet brother,' which is fine by me,\\" Bob Weinstein wrote in an essay for Vanity Fair in 2003. \\"It actually works out for the best that only one of us likes the spotlight. There wouldn't physically be enough room in it for both.\\" But this month, following bombshell reports alleging that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed and assaulted dozens of women over decades, Bob Weinstein has been forced into the center of a roiling scandal, emerging as a vehement critic of his embattled brother even as he also faces an allegation of sexual misconduct. Harvey and Bob Weinstein after the red carpet opening of the movie \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" in Los Angeles in November 2011. J.Emilio Flores / Corbis via Getty Images file Bob Weinstein, 63, blasted Harvey Weinstein, 65, last Thursday as a \\"very sick man\\" and a \\"world class liar\\" whose remorse rings \\"hollow.\\" Just five days later, Variety reported that Amanda Segel, a former executive producer of the sci-fi series \\"The Mist,\\" claimed that Bob Weinstein made repeated romantic overtures to her and would not take no for an answer. \\"Bob kept referring to me that he wanted to have a friendship,\\" Segel told Variety. \\"He didn't want a friendship. He wanted more than that. My hope is that 'no' is enough from now on.\\" Bert Fields, a lawyer for Bob Weinstein, denied the allegations. \\"Variety's story about Bob Weinstein is riddled with false and misleading assertions by Ms. Segel and we have the emails to prove it,\\" he said in part, adding: \\"There is no way in the world that Bob Weinstein is guilty of sexual harassment.\\" A representative for Harvey Weinstein has said \\"any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.\\" Both brothers have also come under fresh scrutiny for their brash tactics, which some have called abusive, at their firms, Miramax and The Weinstein Company. The brothers’ behavior is recounted in \\"Down and Dirty Pictures,\\" a 2004 book by veteran entertainment journalist Peter Biskind. Movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, who condemned Harvey Weinstein following explosive reports in The New York Times and The New Yorker, leveled harsh words this week at Bob Weinstein, saying he had significant \\"issues\\" with him when they worked together in the 1990s. \\"Bob Weinstein was genuinely abusive with people in my company,\\" Katzenberg, the former chairman of Walt Disney Studios, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. (Disney acquired Miramax in 1993.) \\"There's the fascinating thing about this,\\" Katzenberg said, apparently referring to the overall scandal. \\"The one person who did reveal himself in an unacceptable way to me was, in fact, Bob.\\" ||||| Now, the alleged misconduct threatens to take down everything they've built. Although Bob Weinstein said he took steps in recent years to distance himself from his disgraced brother, their fates may be intertwined. Some people close to the company say it will be difficult for Bob Weinstein to retain a leadership role in the Weinstein Co. — if it survives at all. And the Weinstein name may be forever tainted, making it difficult for him to start fresh in Hollywood. ||||| The Weinstein Co. exec insists he had no idea about \\"the type of predator that he was\\" and is sickened by Harvey’s seeming lack of remorse. \\"I want him to get the justice that he deserves.\\" For nearly 30 years, Bob Weinstein has lived in the shadow of his older brother Harvey. While Harvey, 65, was the very public face of Miramax and then The Weinstein Co. from Sundance to Cannes to Hollywood, palling around with stars and schmoozing Oscar voters, Bob, 62, has served on TWC's board and tended to Dimension, their genre label, turning out movies like the Scream and Scary Movie franchises that routinely made more money than all but Harvey's biggest hits. Now, in the wake of the dozens of allegations charging Harvey with three decades of sexual harassment, abuse and even rape, he is out, fired from the company he co-founded with Bob in 2005. And Bob, thrust into an unaccustomed limelight, is forced to try to pick up the pieces amid the growing chaos. He insists that the company — which is expected to undergo a name change — can survive. But four of his fellow board members have resigned, and his COO David Glasser and other key members of his 150-employee staff have yet to commit to stay with the company. Amid widespread predictions that The Weinstein Co. will be forced to shut down or sell all or parts, Bob maintains, \\"There is a plan to come out on the other side.\\" But right now, even as he struggles to right the company (of which he and Harvey each own about 20 percent), Bob is also coping with his own sense of shame and betrayal, expressing sympathy for Harvey's victims while also questioning whether he should have done more in the face of Harvey's alleged abusive behavior. Bob, who worked mostly in Los Angeles while Harvey presided over TWC's New York offices, says he's barely spoken to his brother over the past five years. \\"I could not take his cheating, his lying and also his attitude toward everyone,\\" he says. While Bob says he knew his brother was unfaithful to wife Georgina Chapman, he insists he had no idea about \\"the type of predator that he was\\" and is sickened by Harvey's seeming lack of remorse. \\"I have a brother that's indefensible and crazy,\\" says Bob, adding, \\"I want him to get the justice that he deserves.\\" Amid the chaos and uncertain future at TWC, Bob agreed to a 45-minute phone interview with The Hollywood Reporter. During the talk, he often became emotional when discussing his brother and the company they co-founded. He refused to discuss certain specifics, such as the claim in The New York Times that he and the board were aware of Harvey's settlements with women during Harvey's most recent contract negotiation, or the fate of certain TWC movies, such as the year-end title The Current War. But he opened up on the personal aspect of the scandal and said he believed the Film Academy should expel his \\"sick and depraved\\" brother. How do you assess what has happened? I find myself in a waking nightmare. My brother has caused unconscionable suffering. As a father of three girls, I say this with every bone in my body — I am heartbroken for the women that he has harmed. I'm a fighter. For my entire adult life, I fought for the films I want to see the light of day. I have fought for my employees, who have dedicated their lives to achieving the vision of this company that me and my brother founded. But I cannot fight what is indefensible. The members of the board, including myself, did not know the extent of my brother's actions. I know him on a personal level better than anyone. It's hard to describe how I feel that he took out the emptiness inside of him in so many sick and depraved ways. It's a sickness but not a sickness that is excusable. It's a sickness that's inexcusable. And I, as a brother, understood and was aware as a family member that my brother needed help and that something was wrong. I was also the object of a lot of his verbal abuse — at one time physical abuse. And I am not looking for one bit of sympathy from anyone. I do not put myself in the category at all of those women that he hurt. But it's a complicated situation when it's your brother doing the abusing to you as well. I saw it and I asked him to get help for many years. And that's the truth. He avoided getting the help. We begged him. This hurts, but I don't feel an ounce of remorse coming from him, and that kills me, too. When I heard his written, lame excuse … Not an excuse. When I heard his admission of feeling remorse for the victims and then him cavalierly, almost crazily saying he was going to go out and take on the NRA, it was so disturbing to me. It was utter insanity. My daughters all felt sick hearing this because we understood he felt nothing. I don't feel he feels anything to this day. I don't. One question that is on everybody's mind: He is your brother — how in the world did you not know this was going on? First of all, let me tell you something that people don't know. For the last five years, I've probably talked to my brother 10 times on any personal level. That's the fracture that's gone on. Since Dimension started, we ran two separate companies. So many of the people that he does business with — actors, actresses — I've never even met and they know it. I wanted to lead a separate existence. So we were leading two separate divisions. I actually was quite aware that Harvey was philandering with every woman he could meet. I was sick and disgusted by his actions. But that's the extent of what [I knew]. I said, \\"Harvey, you're just cheating. Why do you constantly cheat?\\" I could see it. But I wasn't in the room with him. For me, I thought he was literally just going out there cheating in a pervasive way. It wasn't like he even had a mistress. It was one after another and that I was aware of. But as far as being in a room and hearing the description in The New York Times? No way. No F-in' way was I aware that that was the type of predator that he was. And the way he convinced people to do things? I thought they were all consensual situations. I'll tell you what I did know. Harvey was a bully, Harvey was arrogant, he treated people like shit all the time. That I knew. And I had to clean up for so many of his employee messes. People that came in crying to my office: \\"Your brother said this, that and the other.\\" And I'd feel sick about it. Why did you tolerate his behavior? Because it didn't rise to a certain level. I would often counsel people and say, \\"You know what, you have a choice here. Leave. Leave, please leave.\\" I don't know why some of them stayed. So I would just try to mend a broken fence. There is no mending this. This is not a broken fence. [But] I will not quit and leave the business that I built, rightfully so, and leave the films and filmmakers that I was involved in. When you guys were negotiating Harvey's 2015 employment contract … That I'm not gonna [discuss]. I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be litigated in this article. There is an investigation going on, let that investigation take its course. Do you think Harvey should be kicked out of the Academy? Yes, I do. I was gonna actually write [to the Academy]. And I will do it. I am gonna write a note to them saying he definitely should be kicked out of the Academy. You issued a statement earlier today saying that the company is not for sale despite reports that it could be shut down or its parts sold off. If it's not for sale, what is the plan to salvage this company? We are thinking about how to do that. We had an employee meeting the other day, all 180 of the employees. And me and David Glasser addressed them all. Talk about emotions cascading. These innocent people are hurt, so many of them not knowing anything about my brother's behavior. But I was touched because — and I did not know this was coming — they said, \\"We don't want Harvey to have the last word on this company. We want to stay. We believe in the films, we believe in you, Bob, David Glasser, we believe in ourselves. And we definitely don't want to let him win.\\" And that's a part of the human story that nobody is hearing. I know they're saying, \\"Shut this company down.\\" Well, they didn't shut Fox News down, they didn't shut NBC down. My brother is the one that should pay with everything. And I mean literally — whether it's criminal or otherwise — I will be supportive of all of that. But I don't think the people that are the employees of this company or the company itself should pay. Harvey was the face of the company. That's what he loves. It's actually part of his whole thing, being famous. This brother is not that brother. This brother made just as much money, ran a successful division, more successful financially than Harvey's. But I'm a different guy and I run it differently and people know it and they know I can be successful and we don't need to do any of the Harvey stuff. And there is a plan. All I'm trying to do right now is go forward, figure out a plan, me and David Glasser and the board members have an idea of what we'd like to do, that we think would be the responsible thing to do for all the critics, rightfully so, with regards to the TWC side and yet for people to keep their jobs. And the pieces of the business that still can be resurrected and continue, we think that they should. Do you have a new name for the company? We're coming up with one. And it won't be familial, I promise you that. Any effort to keep the company going will depend on financial backing. Aren't the finances of this company in trouble? We have good enough finances, the banks gave us their support today. What does that mean? With scandal, sometimes people can just say, \\"We don't want to be associated.\\" They're supporting us. And in terms of surviving, we have enough good product and things on our slate. We are moving quickly, and there are people interested in participating financially on the condition, rightfully so, that Harvey Weinstein is out for good. But you have people like Lin-Manuel Miranda trying to get In the Heights extricated from the company. You have Disney dropping you guys from producing Artemis Fowl. Apple and Amazon have scrapped big TV projects. Collaborators are turning their backs on you. How do you survive that? We will, is my answer, and there are a lot of things in process with regards to a lot of those kinds of things that will get resolved in an amicable way and a good financial way. I really don't want to get into the particulars of any one situation. All I can say is that there is a plan to come out on the other side. And also the other side that makes the public rightfully feel happy that what Harvey stood for exists no longer. The public deserves that. The victims deserve that. Everybody deserves that. Those bankers, they look at my slate and they know that I've made them money for many, many years. And lately I have had a cold hand, there is no two ways about it, on the Dimension side, but I have a fuckin' great slate coming up and they're aware of it. And this is a business where all the sudden you walk into Stephen King's It one day. And things change. It is that kind of business. I have Six Billion Dollar Man, I'm closing a deal on it. I have Paddington 2, Paddington 3 is coming two years later. I'm back in the wheelhouse of what I've done. And when I'm back on, there is money to be made, there's jobs to be had. Harvey knew how to take credit, win his awards. But for me, there are no Academy Awards. Bob's not going to the Golden Globes or the Oscars unless somebody invites me. There have been reports that Jay Z might buy Harvey's stake in the company … I'd love nothing more than that, but as far as I know, that is not a fact. There are predictions for a raft of civil litigation against the company and against Harvey personally. How can the company withstand that? That's for lawyers and people like that to go deal with. That's what they do. And things end up getting resolved, they do. My hope is that the community will allow us the time to get it right for those that deserve to continue on. That's all I can say and that's what I'm trying to do. But it's going to take time. I cannot do it in a week. Has anyone in Hollywood reached out to you with support? Yes, they have. David Glasser had a meeting with David Hutkin, who is the CFO, and the banks have been supportive. They want to see us succeed and they see that there is a product line of many movies on my side, TV shows that have been done. That they say this company can still be viable. And there have been other people that have been supportive, other companies that are doing business with us, that are sticking by us. What about the talent agencies? They are going to be key to any company going forward. Have they expressed support? There have been men and women, actresses, actors, directors, but especially women I would say, who are so properly disgusted with my brother's actions. Their attitude is when there is finally the entire divorce, when there's the plan in place, when there is the separation in place … I have a reputation that's different than Harvey, obviously, and I work differently than him. And David Glasser is his own man. We have our own status in the industry. And they're saying we will give the two of you a chance. You have to make the separation. [With] my brother having contractual financial rights in this company, the divorce is going to be as speedy as we can make it. It's in process. But Harvey's going to fight his firing. Anybody can do what they want to do. I cannot control other people's actions. But he was fired by the board, okay? I was on that board. I fired him. He can fight. It will be a losing fight. He may be fired but he still maintains his ownership interest in the company, correct? That is correct and we are going to seek to sever that. It can't be done that quickly. But I am on it 24/7 and so is David Glasser and so is the board of directors that remain and so are the shareholders. This is being dealt with. Given your relationship with Harvey, there is a contingent out there who believe that you were responsible for the leak of this information, especially the internal HR memo that made it to The New York Times. Is that true? That's totally untrue. I could take a lie detector test on that. I didn't and, you know, Harvey is suspicious of everybody. People that are liars — lying to his wife, to his children, to everyone — well, they have to turn around and say, \\"Who stabbed me?\\" It's unbelievable that even to this moment he is more concerned with who sold him out. I don't hear concern or contrition for the victims. And I want them to hear that. Harvey has no remorse whatsoever. I have spoken to him two times [since news broke], hoping to hear, \\"Oh, my God, what have I done?\\" I didn't hear that. What did you hear? I heard a guy who still was fighting to get back and I was disgusted by it. Do you know how disgusted I am? I divorced my brother five years ago. Literally. And those that know me personally in this company understood how I could not take being around him on any level. And certainly my daughters and my family knew it. I could not take his cheating, his lying and also his attitude toward everyone. I had to divorce myself to survive. Nobody is perfect. I'm not perfect. If I made mistakes, I apologize to everyone for not standing up stronger and sooner. But if you want to take my head and the company's and everybody else's. … If I lose at the end of the day, then I lose it. But I'll fight for what I believe is right. And I'll apologize for my own lack of strength at times. Do you believe that the 2015 incident with model Ambra Battilana and the NYPD investigation derailed the deal for ITV to acquire the company's TV division? Again, this is where I draw the line in terms of getting into a specific. I don't want to comment on that kind of specific. I'll ask a general question then: Do you believe that Harvey's antics hurt the business in the past? I'm being honest. I don't know what hurt or didn't. I haven't had a relationship with him as a brother for many, many years. But I'm ashamed that he is my brother, to be honest, and I am ashamed that these are his actions. I'm not thinking at this moment about dissecting what may or may not have affected any past situation. I'm so in the here and now and feel sick. Mira Sorvino came out and told her story [in The New Yorker]. I have been a personal friend of Mira for the last several years. We reconnected when I rented a house in Malibu. Mira, her husband and her kids have come over and spent many hours together with us. [But] she never told me. And now I literally was texting with her, and she said, \\"Are you mad at me?\\" And I said, \\"Mad at you? I'm so proud of you, but I feel sick that you had to hold that kind of thing in.\\" [Harvey] should never be allowed back, ever. Ever. He lost his rights. He didn't lose his rights to be rehabilitated as a human being. But as far as being in this town again? I mean, give me a break. What do you think Harvey will do with the rest of his life? He lived for this business and he lived for the outside [persona]. There were no insides to this, as far as I can see. So unless there becomes an inner person inside there, I have no idea what he'll do. Will you cooperate with any police investigation? A hundred percent, if it came to that. If I had anything to offer, I would. A hundred percent. There have been stories that once, when Harvey got physical with you, he broke your nose? He didn't break my nose, but he got physical and there were several people there, and he assaulted me. And I should've done something then. Why did you not? All I can tell you is it's like asking any other victim why they didn't stand up. I regret that beyond all measure. I live with that. That was a defining moment for me of cowardice on my own part. Not easy to live with. It doesn't absolve me of my own cowardice, but this is the thing that happens, this is the nature of that whole syndrome. And it's disgusting on every level. But hopefully, the more it's talked about — I was happy when people started to come out. It made other people braver. Well, you've had some anger issues in the past as well … Yes, but I've done my work. Without getting into details, I've done enough work, and I've faced my own self. There are those that do the work and those that don't. I did it. I'm not that guy and that's not the way I operate. Any last thing you'd like the entertainment community to hear from you with regard to this situation? I'm mortified and disgusted by my brother's actions. And I am sick for the victims. And I feel for them. I feel for them. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Bob Weinstein, the younger brother of disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, has been forced to step out of his brother's shadow amid the wave of sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey.

Q:Information: - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - The United States Maritime Service (USMS) was established in 1938 under the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. The mission of the organization is to train people to become officers and crewmembers on merchant ships that form the United States Merchant Marine per Title 46 U.S. Code 51701. Heavily utilized during World War II, the USMS has since been largely dissolved and/or absorbed into other federal departments, but its commissioned officers continue to function as administrators and instructors at the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the several maritime academies. - The United States Maritime Commission (MARCOM) was an independent executive agency of the U.S. federal government that was created by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, passed by Congress on June 29, 1936, and replaced the United States Shipping Board which had existed since World War I. It was intended to formulate a merchant shipbuilding program to design and build five hundred modern merchant cargo ships to replace the World War I vintage vessels that comprised the bulk of the United States Merchant Marine, and to administer a subsidy system authorized by the Act to offset the cost differential between building in the U.S. and operating ships under the American flag. It also formed the United States Maritime Service for the training of seagoing ship's officers to man the new fleet. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - USNS Kingsport ( T - AG - 164 ) was built as SS Kingsport Victory , a United States Maritime Commission VC2 - S - AP3 ( Victory ) type cargo ship . During the closing days of World War II the ship was operated by the American Hawaiian Steamship Company under an agreement with the War Shipping Administration . After a period of layup the ship was operated as USAT Kingsport Victory by the Army under bareboat charter effective 8 July 1948 . When Army transports were transferred to the Navy 's Navy 's Military Sea Transportation Service the ship continued as a cargo transport as USNS Kingsport Victory ( T - AK - 239 ) . On 14 November 1961 , after conversion into the first satellite communication ship , the ship was renamed Kingsport , preclassifird as a general auxiliary , and operated as USNS Kingsport ( T - AG - 164 ) . Assigned to duty supporting the U.S. Army Satellite Communications Agency USNS Kingsport was further modified and , in August 1963 while in Lagos harbor , transmitted the first satellite voice call between heads of state when John F. Kennedy and Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Balewa aboard Kingsport spoke in a two - way call . A demonstration of transmission of oceanographic data was made between a research vessel off Africa via the ship and satellite to Washington . The first air to ship satellite communication took place when Navy aircraft off Virginia established voice communication with Kingsport which was off Morocco . Further satellite communications work took place in the Pacific and Indian Oceans . Kingsport then supported Project Gemini into March 1966 . After conversion from satellite configuration , particularly removal of the large and very visible dome , Kingsport was engaged in acoustic work for the Navy supporting undersea surveillance programs . - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Vice Admiral Emory Scott Land (January 8, 1879 November 27, 1971) was an officer in the United States Navy, noted for his contributions to naval architecture, particularly in submarine design. Notable assignments included serving as Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair during the 1930s, and as Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission during World War II. - The War Shipping Administration (WSA) was a World War II emergency war agency of the US government, tasked to purchase and operate the civilian shipping tonnage the US needed for fighting the war. Both shipbuilding under the Maritime Commission and ship allocation under the WSA to Army, Navy or civilian needs were closely coordinated though Vice Admiral Emory S. Land who continued as head of the Maritime Commission while also heading the WSA. - The United States Merchant Marine refers to either United States civilian mariners, or to U.S. civilian and federally owned merchant vessels. Both the civilian mariners, and the merchant vessels, are managed by a combination of the government and private sectors, and engage in commerce or transportation of goods and services in and out of the navigable waters of the United States. The Merchant Marine primarily transports cargo and passengers during peacetime; in times of war, the Merchant Marine can be an auxiliary to the United States Navy, and can be called upon to deliver military personnel and materiel for the military. Merchant Marine officers may also be commissioned as military officers by the Department of Defense. This is commonly achieved by commissioning unlimited tonnage Merchant Marine officers as Strategic Sealift Officers in the Naval Reserves. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the person whose camera got smashed but his photographic film survived the impact?, using the article: American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diem's regime, with the images of the burning Thich Quang Duc on the front pages still fresh in the minds of the public.

These unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would be launched to hover over a disaster area and assess the situation. This information is then sent to emergency services to so they can co-ordinate a response and send help to the right place. Robots would also be sent to areas on the ground that are too dangerous for humans, where they could defuse bombs or rescue people who are trapped. The research has only been tested on a computer so far but Prof Jennings wants to test his robots out in a real-life situation.

A keystone species is one that plays an especially important role in its community. Major changes in the numbers of a keystone species affect the populations of many other species in the community. For example, some sea star species are keystone species in coral reef communities. The sea stars prey on mussels and sea urchins, which have no other natural predators. If sea stars were removed from a coral reef community, mussel and sea urchin populations would have explosive growth. This, in turn, would drive out most other species. In the end, the coral reef community would be destroyed. Choices: - complement - Invasive - Leader - keystone A: Answer:","completion":"Keystone"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the word \\"trojan\\" used in the same way in the following two sentences? The contents of a trojan can be a virus or a worm. When he downloaded the free game it turned out to be a trojan.","completion":"Yes, the term \\"trojan\\" is used in the same way in both sentences. Step 1: Understanding the term \\"Trojan\\" The term \\"Trojan\\" in context of computer science refers to a type of malicious software or code that looks legitimate but can take control over a computer's functions. It can potentially harm the computer by deleting data or stealing personal information. Step 2: Analyzing the Sentences - Sentence 1 (\\"The contents of a trojan can be a virus or a worm.\\") is talking about what a Trojan can contain, in this case, a virus or a worm. Hence, it refers to a Trojan as a type of malicious software. - Sentence 2 (\\"When he downloaded the free game it turned out to be a trojan.\\") talks about downloading something that looks legitimate (a free game in this case), but it turns out to be harmful, a Trojan. This hence also refers to a Trojan as a type of malicious software. In both the sentences, \\"Trojan\\" is used to refer to malicious software that appears legitimate but contains something harmful. So, yes the word \\"Trojan\\" is used in the same way in both the sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Context: Some economists have stated that Reagans policies were an important part of bringing about the third longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history. During the Reagan administration, real GDP growth averaged 3.5%, compared to 2.9% during the preceding eight years. The annual average unemployment rate declined by 1.7 percentage points, from 7.2% in 1980 to 5.5% in 1988, after it had increased by 1.6 percentage points over the preceding eight years. Nonfarm employment increased by 16.1 million during Reagans presidency, compared to 15.4 million during the preceding eight years, while manufacturing employment declined by 582,000 after rising 363,000 during the preceding eight years. Reagans administration is the only one not to have raised the minimum wage. The inflation rate, 13.5% in 1980, fell to 4.1% in 1988, due to the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates (prime rate peaking at 20.5% in August 1981). The latter contributed to a recession from July 1981 to November 1982 during which unemployment rose to 9.7% and GDP fell by 1.9%. Additionally, income growth slowed for middle- and lower-class (2.4% to 1.8%) and rose for the upper-class (2.2% to 4.83%).

Her 17-year-old brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Dawn's younger sister, 8-year-old Missy, is a spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Their mother is a shrewd woman who always dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek, immature, selfish man who sides with Dawn's mother in arguments with Dawn. Mark is the only one in the family who is even remotely friendly or respectful to Dawn and even that isn't saying a whole lot. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate fifth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard. At school, Dawn is verbally bullied by literally every student she comes into contact with. She is teased and ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. After her teacher unfairly keeps her after school, she is threatened with rape by a bully named Brandon McCarthy, who also has trouble socializing. At home, Dawn's mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her (the same verbal way that other students at the school call Dawn). Dawn is suspended for three days after she accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball. She refuses to tell her parents or the school principal about the bullying, aware that it will only lead to worse bullying for herself.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Constipation is not a glamorous topic, but it’s certainly important, especially in older adults. As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those. In short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older... Question: What are some side effects of constipation in the elderly?

In May: Rodman asks","completion":"Kim Jong Un to release Kenneth Bae Upon his arrival in North Korea, Dennis Rodman was greeted by a group of North Korean officials and a swarm of international journalists. The media continued to question Rodman about his intentions regarding Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary who was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea after being accused of trying to topple the government. During the first few days of his trip, Rodman stuck to his plan of focusing on basketball diplomacy. He participated in several events and held workshops for North Korean basketball teams, which included an exhibition game played in front of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, who also happens to be a basketball fan. Despite his earlier statements, it seemed that Rodman could not shake off the issue of Kenneth Bae. He was repeatedly asked by journalists if he would use his influence and close relationship with Kim Jong Un to seek Bae's release. Additionally, Bae's family and supporters in the United States had expressed their hope that Rodman would raise the issue during his visit. In response to the mounting pressure from various parties and realizing that he could potentially use his unique position to make a difference, Rodman decided to address the issue in a meeting with Kim Jong Un after the exhibition game. Rodman expressed his concerns about Bae's well-being and imprisonment, emphasizing that releasing Bae would be seen as a significant goodwill gesture by the United States and the international community. Kim Jong Un, seemingly touched by Rodman's concern and having developed a mutual respect for the former basketball star, agreed to consider the release of Bae but needed to consult with his advisors first. Rodman, while cautious, was optimistic about the outcome and promised to continue pushing for Bae's release. Upon returning to the United States, Rodman revealed his efforts to help secure Bae's freedom in an exclusive interview with CNN. While some praised his actions, others criticized him for not having a solid plan or background in diplomacy. Shortly after Rodman's trip, the North Korean government announced that it would release Kenneth Bae on humanitarian grounds. Though they did not directly attribute his release to Rodman's intervention, it was widely speculated that the high-profile visit played a key role in securing Bae's freedom. Rodman's basketball diplomacy visit was seen as controversial by some but ultimately led to Bae's release, opening the door for future diplomatic negotiations between North Korea and the United States. Meanwhile, Rodman continued his efforts to use sports as a means of bridging cultural gaps and fostering understanding between nations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rapid eye movements in sleep and wakefulness To compare neuronal activity underlying REMs in sleep and wakefulness, we conducted full-night (421±20 min (mean±s.e.m.)) polysomnographic sleep studies with adjacent epochs of wakefulness (n=13 participants), as well as recordings during controlled visual stimulation (n=9 participants) and an eye-movement paradigm (one participant), in 19 neurosurgical patients with intractable epilepsy. Participants were implanted with depth electrodes (Fig. 1a–c) that recorded depth EEG and spiking activity during sleep and wake from 600 units (355 putative single units, 245 multi-unit clusters), as described thoroughly elsewhere20. Stability of unit recordings across several hours was assessed in detail (Supplementary Fig. 1). Recordings also included synchronized scalp EEG, electrooculogram (EOG), electromyogram and continuous video monitoring. Sleep–wake stages were scored following established guidelines21. Sleep architecture and power spectra of scalp EEG were in general agreement with typical findings in healthy young adults. Figure 1: Data overview and eye movement detection. (a) Set-up for polysomnographic sleep and wake recordings. (b) Illustration of flexible probes used for recording depth EEG (blue: platinum contact) and unit activity (green: microwires). (c) Medial view of depth electrode locations (purple dots) spanning multiple brain regions. (d) REM detection: first row, raw EOG showing two typical REMs in REM sleep. Second row, band-pass filtered (0.1–3 Hz) EOG with thresholds set at mean+2 s.d. (black lines). Third row, detection of epochs crossing the threshold in one EOG channel (green dots). Fourth row, detection is confirmed with opposite polarity in second EOG channel (yellow dot). Fifth row, verification that epoch is free of epileptic spikes in high-pass filtered trace. Sixth row, visual confirmation of REM onset. (e) Occurrence of REMs across vigilance states (mean±s.e.m., n=11/12/13 in REM sleep, wake and Non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep, respectively). Note the near-absence of REMs in NREM sleep. (f) Average traces of REMs in each participant during wakefulness (black, n=12) and REM (red, n=11). (g) Example of EOGs (top, red/blue), depth EEG (brown) and unit spiking activities in the MTL (black lines) during 20 s of wakefulness. Vertical green lines depict detections of REM onsets.

Full size image (123 KB) Figures/tables index Next REMs were detected in EOG traces in a semi-automatic fashion (see Methods section, Fig. 1d–f). REMs were selected for further analysis when at least 20 events were detected for a given subject and sleep stage (n=12 and 11 individuals for wakefulness and REM sleep, respectively). On an average, 3.7±0.8 and 2.6±0.5 REMs per minute were detected in REM sleep and wakefulness, respectively, while detection in NREM sleep was not significantly different from zero (Fig. 1e; P=0.17, Mann–Whitney U-test, n=13 patients), attesting to a low rate of false detections. The relatively low density of REMs in wakefulness likely reflects the experimental setup (overnight recordings in darkness) and EOG measurements that best capture saccades with a large horizontal component (see Supplementary Note for further details). The morphology of REMs in sleep and wakefulness was highly similar (Fig. 1f), in line with previous studies4, 22. For example, when subtracting the EOG traces of w-REMs and s-REMs, no statistical differences were found (paired t-test, n=11 pairs, α=0.05, False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons). Modulation of neuronal activity during REMs We set out to examine if neuronal activity, especially that occurring in MTL regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus (Table 1), is robustly modulated in concert with REMs, and to what extent such activity is reminiscent of visually evoked activity in wakefulness. To this end, we compared neuronal activity during (a) REM sleep (‘s-REMs’), (b) spontaneous REMs in wakefulness (‘w-REMs’) and (c) during a controlled visual stimulation paradigm in which subjects maintained fixation during short (200 ms) presentation of images. Figure 1g depicts representative traces of eye movements along with simultaneously recorded neuronal activity and depth EEG in the MTL. As can be seen, in some cases, REMs were associated with modulations in spiking activity. Table 1: Bi-phasic single-unit modulation around REMs is more prevalent in the MTL compared with frontal regions. Full table Figures/tables index We proceeded to quantify the REM-related changes in neuronal activity across the entire data set, and further compared such activities to visually evoked responses to pictures of faces and places (n=133 responsive neurons out of 1,457 overall; 27 sessions in eight individuals, see Methods section). A triggered-averaging analysis was performed around REM onsets, as well as following controlled visual stimulation (Fig. 2). We examined simultaneously recorded scalp EEG (n=12, 10 and 4 electrodes located at Pz in wake, sleep and visual experiment, respectively), depth EEG (n=53 (13 patients), 51 (11 patients) and 13 (2 patients) recording sites in wake, sleep and visual experiment, respectively) and spiking activity within the MTL (n=437, 349 and 1,049 in wake, sleep and visual experiment, respectively).

Full size image (151 KB) Previous Figures/tables index Next Scalp event-related potentials (ERPs) around REMs (Fig. 2b) during both sleep and wakefulness revealed a waveform in line with previous studies23, consisting of an initial transient peak before saccade onset ((−25 to 0)ms, P<0.001, one-tailed t-test compared with a (−800 to −400)ms baseline) followed by a second positive component ((50–200)ms P<0.001). Following controlled visual stimulation, the scalp ERP exhibited a more delayed positive component ((200–600)ms, P<0.05; Fig. 2b, right). In the depth EEG (‘dERP’), robust evoked potentials were found across MTL regions in relation to REMs with a similar positivity around 150 ms as found in the scalp EEG (P<0.01, Fig. 2c). This component was absent during visual presentation without eye movements (P>0.8, Fig. 2c, right). Notwithstanding, a late negativity ((300–400)ms, P<0.05) was observed within the MTL after REMs in sleep and wakefulness, as well as after the presentation of images with fixation. Since depth EEG signals were referenced to ear lobes (thereby attenuating ocular artifacts24), the presence of robust dERPs in the MTL (and especially components occurring hundreds of milliseconds after eye movement onsets) suggests an underlying modulation of neuronal activity upon REMs in both sleep and wakefulness, whose late component is reminiscent of visual-evoked activity. Most importantly, single-unit spiking activity was robustly modulated around REMs, and this modulation was highly similar across wakefulness and REM sleep. A pattern consisting of a reduction in firing rate just before REM onsets, followed by subsequent increased spiking was observed in the average activity of all recorded units in wakefulness. A similar albeit weaker modulation was likewise observed in the average activity across all units during REM-sleep (Supplementary Fig. 2a, n=412 and n=318 in wakefulness and sleep, respectively). We searched for neurons whose activity was significantly modulated in any direction and at any time interval around REMs (see Methods section and Supplementary Fig. 2 for full details of selection process). From this unbiased approach, the stereotypical bi-phasic pattern of activity emerged in both sleep and wakefulness (Supplementary Fig. 2b). We then focused on the units showing this bi-phasic pattern in MTL regions specifically for further analysis (see Methods section and Fig. 2d,e for MTL population average and representative neurons, respectively) since neurons that showed bi-phasic modulations around REMs were more readily observed in the MTL (Table 1, 24% of all MTL units in wake (n=79 in 10 patients) and 18% in REM sleep (n=47 in 9 patients)) compared with frontal lobe regions (13% in wake and 12% in REM sleep). In contrast, non bi-phasic modulation profiles were observed as frequently across regions (Table 1). Along the same line, when searching for bi-phasic activity profiles around random time points (instead of real REMs), a significantly lower proportion of MTL neurons was found (one-tailed paired Mann–Whitney U-test, P<0.01, see Supplementary Material) but the proportion of frontal lobe neurons did not show such a difference (P=0.9). The higher proportion of bi-phasic modulations in the MTL argues against a global non-specific activity pattern. Finally, the temporal dynamics of increased MTL firing following REMs was reminiscent of neuronal responses in the controlled visual experiment (Fig. 2d,e, right), although these were of stronger amplitude (P<0.001)—a difference to be expected given that stimuli were specifically selected to drive strong responses in the recorded neurons (Methods section). On an average, around REMs, bi-phasic neurons reduced their firing by 11% in sleep and 7% in wake at −200 ms (P<0.005, t-test) and increased their firing by 17% in sleep and 22% in wake at +250 ms (P<0.001, t-test). The post-REM increase coincided in time with the negativity observed in the dERPs. The pre-REM reduction in firing was unrelated to effects of previous REMs, as it was similarly observed also when focusing on ‘isolated’ REMs that did not occur in succession (not shown). In addition, visual responses were substantially later in time, peaking at 300 ms after image onset, whereas post-REM activity peaked around 250 ms after REM onset (equivalent roughly to 150 ms after eventual fixation25). In summary, REMs in both sleep and wakefulness were associated with multiple signatures of transient neuronal activities in the MTL that were similar across vigilance states and reminiscent of visually evoked activity. To further investigate to what extent REM-related effects were driven by motor aspects of eye movements (‘corollary discharge’) versus visual-like aspects, we further divided wakefulness into putatively ‘visual’ and ‘non-visual’ periods based on behavioural notes (for example, watching television or meeting family in a well-lit room as ‘visual’ versus lying with open eyes in a dark room as ‘non-visual’, see Supplementary Methods). The rate of w-REMs in ‘visual’ periods was significantly greater than in ‘non-visual’ periods (14.7±14.6 versus 0.7±2.8 REMs per minute, P<0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test). Analysis of evoked potentials (Fig. 3) revealed that both ‘visual’ and ‘non-visual’ epochs were associated with a significant suppression of firing rates prior to REM onsets (difference from baseline: P<0.01, between ‘visual’ and ‘non-visual’: P=0.09, Mann–Whitney U-test, N=110 units and 140 REMs across eight patients). However, only ‘visual’ epochs showed a robust increase in neuronal activity after REM onsets within the MTL (difference between ‘visual’ and baseline: P<0.05; ‘non-visual’ and baseline: P=0.33). Similarly, dERPs of ‘visual’ and ‘non-visual’ differed in their late negative potential (Fig. 3a), which was present only for ‘visual’ REMs (significant difference observed 375–475 ms after REM onset, t-test, P<0.05, FDR correction). Moreover, a controlled paradigm during wakefulness in one individual further compared neuronal modulations occurring around w-REMs with closed eyes or during darkness with saccades towards visual targets (or passive fixation). Interestingly, already at the level of EOG waveforms, eye movements with open eyes and those occurring during REM sleep were highly similar, whereas w-REMs with closed eyes during wakefulness had markedly slower kinematics (Fig. 3b). Intracranial-evoked potentials in the MTL revealed a negative deflection following image presentation that also resembled those found after REMs (shown in Fig. 2c). This negative deflection was significantly attenuated during w-REMs without visual input (Fig. 3b). Taken together, these results suggest that neuronal modulations within the MTL after REMs cannot be solely explained by a motor corollary discharge (see also Discussion). Figure 3: Comparison of neuronal activity underlying visual and non-visual REMs. (a) REM-triggered averaging of single-unit firing rate in wakefulness, separately for epochs tagged as ‘non-visual’ (open eyes in a dark room, green) or ‘visual’ (patient watching TV/DVD or interacting with people in a well-lit room, blue). s-REMs during REM sleep are superimposed for comparison (red). Top: mean waveform of EOG traces for ‘visual’ w-REMs (blue), ‘non-visual’ w-REMs (green), and s-REMs (red) could not reveal differences between conditions. Middle: average peri-REM-time-histogram (‘visual’: N=79 units and 1,250 REMs; ‘non-visual’: N=47 units and 140 REMs) expressed in percentage change of baseline. Statistical analysis matched for sample size (n=140 REMs in both conditions) revealed a significant decrease in firing rate prior to REM onsets for both ‘visual’ and ‘non-visual’ epochs, whereas a significant increase was observed following REM onsets only for ‘visual’ w-REMs (‘visual’: P<0.05, ‘non-visual’: P=0.33, Mann–Whitney U-test). Bottom: dERP time-locked to REMs onset (‘visual’: N=287 REMs in 70 channels, ‘non-visual’: N=287 REMs in 50 channels). Number of REMs were equated across conditions (n=287).

Full size image (137 KB) Previous Figures/tables index Next Spike-train latency, selectivity and theta phase reset Given that the dominant pattern of neuronal activity around s-REMs included a transient increase in firing rate in the few hundred milliseconds following REM onsets, it was of interest to determine to what extent the detailed features of this activity resembled visual processing in wakefulness. In particular, a robust and recently described feature of human MTL responses to visual stimulation is the significant correlation between the latency and the selectivity of neuronal spike trains, reflecting a hierarchical processing mode: a longer latency from image presentation is more readily found in neurons responding to fewer images26. We thus examined the presence and precise onset of spike trains in individual trials following spontaneous REMs in sleep and wakefulness, as well as following controlled visual stimulation. In MTL neurons, spike trains were detected in 23.3±1% (mean±s.e.m.) and 19.6±1% of REMs in wakefulness and sleep, respectively (N=209 and 152 units, respectively). Despite the small subset of REMs associated with spike trains, these events accounted well for the overall increase in firing rate (see Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, the increase in firing rate for REMs associated with spike trains was correlated across vigilance states even when regressing out the mean firing rate of each unit (Spearman's partial correlation: r=0.28, P<0.01, n=131 units in eight patients). Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the average latency of firing rate increase in each MTL neuron (after REM onset) and its selectivity (tendency to increase firing rates only after a small subset of REMs, Methods section). Figure 4a–c present this correlation for w-REMs (Spearman's rank correlation, r=0.26, P=10−4, n=209 in 10 patients), s-REMs (r=0.33, P=10−6, n=152 in 10 patients), and controlled visual stimulation (r=0.48, P=10−8, n=142 in 9 patients). Crucially, when applying the same analysis on random time points during REM sleep (not associated with eye movements), latency and selectivity were not significantly correlated (P=0.3 and P=0.9 for sleep and wake), indicating that this relation occurred at specific moments, rather than reflecting basic properties of neuronal firing such as the average discharge rate. Moreover, in those cases where the same neurons were recorded in both wakefulness and REM sleep, the selectivity of neurons was highly correlated across vigilance states (r=0.71, P=10−23, n=131 units in eight patients, Fig. 4d) such that neurons that were highly selective in their visual responses in wake also showed spike trains following few s-REMs. This relation was conserved even when taking into account the average firing rate of these neurons (partial correlation: r=0.51, P=10−11, n=131 units in eight patients). The average latencies of neurons were also correlated across vigilance states (r=0.20, P=0.02, n=131 units in eight patients); however, this correlation was not significant when regressing out the average firing rate (partial correlation: r=0.09, P=0.3, n=131 units in eight patients). Figure 4: Comparison of transient spike-train properties in REM sleep and wakefulness. (a–c) Scatter plot of spike-train latency (ordinate) versus selectivity (abscissa, percent of trials eliciting a spike-train after REMs or image presentations) in w-REMs (a), s-REMs (b) and in the visual stimulation experiment (c). Low selectivity: neurons responds to all REMs/pictures; high selectivity: neurons responds to few REMs/pictures. Selectivity in c is restricted to a limited number of discrete values due to the use of six images in the image presentation experiment. Note that in all three conditions a robust correlation was observed, indicating the existence of hierarchical processing along the visual-mnemonic axis. Such correlation could not be revealed in random time points during REM sleep and wake. (d) Selectivity following REMs is correlated in the same neurons across wakefulness and sleep (Spearman's rank correlation, r=0.71, P=10−23; partial correlation taking average firing rate into account: r=0.51, P=10−11). ***P<0.001. Full size image (136 KB) Previous Figures/tables index Next Finally, it is well established that theta (4–8 Hz) oscillations prevail in the MTL during both wakefulness and REM sleep27 and that the phase of theta oscillations is reset with engagement of visual-mnemonic mechanisms in humans28 and monkeys29. We found comparable phase resets around 2–6 Hz (‘human theta’, see ref. 30) in s-REMs and w-REMs. A brief and broadband reset was visible at REM onsets (potentially reflecting a myogenic contamination) followed by a delayed, sustained and frequency-specific increase in phase coherence around 2–6 Hz (see Methods section and Fig. 5a,b). Such theta-band coherence was correlated across vigilance states (Pearson’s r=0.27, P<0.05, see Supplementary Methods). Following controlled visual stimulation, stronger phase reset was observed in the MTL and the maximal effect occurred at similar time–frequency windows (Fig. 5c). When considering MTL regions separately (Fig. 5d), hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus showed strong phase resets, while the entorhinal cortex did not show phase coherence above chance levels. These effects were consistant across vigilance states (analysis of variance, effect of regions: P<0.005, F=4.8; effect of state: P=0.4, F=0.6). Similar differences between the theta-phase coherence across MTL regions were observed during controlled imaged presentation. The stronger and delayed effects during controlled visual fixation (in comparison with REMs) mirrored those found in dERPs and single-unit firing rates (Figs 2 and 3). Thus, the temporal dynamics of MTL activity were similar during REM sleep and during visual processing in wakefulness, possibly reflecting a partial conservation of the hierarchical processing in the visuo-mnemonic pathway. ||||| Seeing an imaginary scene (Image: Victor Habbick Visions/Getty) Your body may be still, but as you dream, your eyes can flicker manically. The rapid eye movement stage of sleep is when we have our most vivid dreams – but do our flickering eyes actually “see” anything? It is a question psychologists have been asking since REM sleep was first described in the 1950s, says Yuval Nir at Tel Aviv University in Israel. “The idea was that we scan an imaginary scene,” says Nir. “It’s an intuitive idea, but it has been very difficult to provide evidence for it.” Until now, much of the evidence has been anecdotal, says Nir. “People who were woken up when their eyes were moving from left to right would say they were dreaming about tennis, for example,” he says. Advertisement More evidence comes from a previous study that monitored the sleep of people who have a disorder that means they often physically act out their dreams. Their eye movements matched their actions around 80 per cent of the time – a man dreaming about smoking, for example, appeared to look at a dream ashtray as he put out a cigarette. But most of the REM sleep these people had was not accompanied by body movements, making it hard to know for sure. And other researchers have argued that the eye flickers can’t be linked to “seeing” anything because rapid eye movements happen in both fetuses and people who are blind – neither group would have experience of vision and so wouldn’t be expected to move their eyes to follow an object, for example. In the mind’s eye To investigate further, Nir and his colleagues monitored people who have epilepsy and have electrodes implanted deep into their brains to help with treatment. These electrodes were mostly in the medial temporal lobe, a region that responds strongly to pictures, and allowed the team to record the activity from around 40 neurons in each volunteer’s brain as they slept. They found that activity seemed to spike around a quarter of a second after an eye flicker, just as it did when the volunteers saw an image when awake. “It is very plausible that they are looking at a dream image,” says Nir. “It is extremely interesting… that these eye movement produce something like visual processing during dreaming,” says Michael Czisch at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, Germany. He thinks we might see visual scenes as a side effect of when memories are replayed during sleep. Because the researchers didn’t wake their volunteers, they can’t be sure what they were dreaming, Nir says. “But we are sure that the brain is alternating between different mental imagery,” he says. “Every time you move your eyes, a new image forms in the mind’s eye.” Journal reference: Nature Communications, DOI: 10.1038/ncomms8884 ||||| Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Time for a change of scene? For the first time, scientists have recorded from individual brain cells during the dreaming phase of sleep. After each rapid eye movement (REM) they recorded bursts of activity that match what happens when we are awake and we see - or imagine - a new image. They suggest that these well-known flickering movements accompany a \\"change of scene\\" in our dreams. The recordings were made from patients with electrodes implanted in their brains to monitor seizures. \\"It's a unique opportunity to look at what's happening inside the human brain,\\" Dr Yuval Nir, from Tel Aviv University in Israel, told the BBC. \\"We're very thankful to the epilepsy patients who volunteered to take part.\\" Dr Nir worked with colleagues from France and the US on the study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications. Next slide please Over the course of four years they worked with 19 different patients, recording from electrodes in several different brain areas but largely within the medial temporal lobe. This is not a part of the brain directly involved in vision, Dr Nir said. \\"The activity of these neurons doesn't reflect image processing. It's more about signalling to the brain about a certain concept. \\"You can close your eyes and imagine Queen Elizabeth, and these neurons will fire. This activity implies a refresh of the mental imagery and the associations.\\" When the patients were awake and shown a picture, especially one associated with a memory, the researchers saw a particular pattern of activity. \\"About a 0.3 seconds after the picture appears, these neurons burst - they become vigorously active,\\" Dr Nir explained. \\"This also happens when people just close their eyes and imagine these pictures, or these concepts.\\" Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption This is the first study to record from individual brain cells during REM sleep Intriguingly, he and his colleagues spotted a \\"very, very similar pattern\\" during sleep. In particular, these bursts arrived just after eye movements during REM sleep. This is the phase of sleep in which we dream, and it is characterised by these occasional, very quick eye movements. It has long been thought that these movements might reflect the visual component of dreams, but there has been no clear evidence for this - until now, Dr Nir said. \\"We are intimately familiar with the activity of these neurons. We know they are active every time you look at an image, or when you imagine that image. And now we see them active in a similar way when you move your eyes in REM sleep, so it becomes very probable that the eye movements represent some type of reset, or 'moving onto the next dream frame'. \\"It's almost like when I was growing up and we had slide projectors. You move to the next dream slide, if you like.\\" Switching not scanning This could help to explain why unborn babies and blind people also move their eyes during REM sleep, he added. \\"Even people who are congenitally blind... can still dream about their aunt coming to visit from Florida: her voice, the emotions and all the associations that go with that. \\"And when the dream changes from meeting this aunt to, say, taking your dog for a stroll in the park, then the brain activity changes and this happens in sync with eye movements.\\" Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Our eyes flicker in spurts during the dreaming phase of sleep Other sleep researchers welcomed the findings. Prof Jim Horne, who established the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University, said the study fits with our improving understanding of REM sleep. He also emphasised that flickering of a dreamer's eyes, which only happens in brief spurts, does not mean they are surveying a scene. \\"The eye movements are not actually scanning your dream - they're reorienting your visual thoughts,\\" Prof Horne told BBC News. \\"This study endorses other findings that REM sleep has many similarities to wakefulness. \\"I see REM sleep as rather like the screensaver on your computer; all you need is the touch of a button and your computer leaps to life. It's very close to wakefulness. Non-REM sleep is more like when you switch your computer off, and waking up requires a process of rebooting.\\" Prof William Wisden, a neuroscientist at Imperial College London, was also convinced by the similarity of brain activity between awake and REM states - but he said there are bigger questions still to answer. \\"The most fascinating question of all is why do we have to have REM sleep? Why does our brain have all this circuitry to do that? \\"This paper doesn't answer that, but it does emphasise how similar being awake and in REM sleep are, for particular circuits in the brain.\\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Scientists in France, the United States and Tel Aviv University have provided the first evidence of a new image appearing in a person's dream.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Facts on Poe in honor of the anniversary of his death It was 166 years ago on Wednesday that the world lost Edgar Allen Poe for evermore. Poe, who was 40 years old when he died in 1849, was known for penning haunting stories of dubious women, mad murderers and brain-twisting enigmas. His wild tales also pioneered the shape of the modern-day detective story and launched the science-fiction genre. Here are some other facts about the writer behind classics “The Tell-Tale Heart” and “The Raven”: 1. After the death of his mother, Poe and his sister moved to Richmond, Virginia, to live with other families, according to the Edgar Allan Poe Museum. Poe adopted his new family's surname, Allan, as his middle name. 2. Poe lived across the street from his teenage sweetheart, Elmira, according to the Poe Museum. Despite being secretly engaged, both ended up marrying other people after Elmira's parents broke off the relationship. Poe, then 27, married his cousin, Virginia Clemm — who was 13 years old. After Poe's wife died, Poe and Elmira began a relationship again and were engaged before his untimely death. 3. Four days before his death, a delirious Poe — who was wearing another person’s clothes — was found in a Baltimore gutter by a local newspaper writer, according to Smithsonian Magazine. He was supposed to be in Philadelphia but instead went missing for a week. He stayed in this delirium and experienced hallucinations until his death. It remains a mystery how Poe ended up in Baltimore. 4. During the hallucinations he experienced prior to death, Poe called out \\"Reynolds,\\" according to the magazine. But no one recalled the name. 5. The cause of Poe’s death remains unexplained. Officially, he died from the swelling of the brain, but it was unknown what caused the swelling. There has been multiple speculation including theories of murder and rabies. 6. Poe was originally buried in an unmarked grave in Baltimore — but two decades after his death, a monument was funded through donations. The remains of Poe were taken from their original location of the family plot and put in the front of the cemetery under the monument along with his wife and mother-in-law (who was also his aunt). 7. Dubbed the Poe Toaster, a mystery person began a tradition in 1949 of leaving a somewhat empty bottle of cognac and three roses on Poe's grave Jan. 19 for Poe's birthday, according to society. The toasting ceased in 2009, although others took it upon themselves to continue the tradition in 2012, but are considered Faux Toasters.","completion":"On the anniversary of Edgar Allan Poe's death, we explore some lesser-known facts about his life.
