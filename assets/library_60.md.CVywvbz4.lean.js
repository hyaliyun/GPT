Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. Question: When do you make colomba? Options: A. not enough information B. During Chritmas C. During Thanksgiving D. During Easter The answer is:","completion":"D.

Read this article and answer this question After the Lithuanians were defeated in the Battle of Strėva by the Teutonic Knights in 1348, Liubartas lost all territories except for eastern Volhynia with Lutsk to Casimir and his ally Louis I of Hungary . Liubartas' brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis organized several expeditions to Poland and Red Ruthenia. Lithuanians allied themselves with Muscovy: Liubartas married an unnamed daughter of Konstantin of Rostov, a relative of Simeon of Moscow, and Algirdas married Uliana of Tver, sister-in-law of Simeon. In spring 1351, Lubartas was taken prisoner by Louis, but was released in summer after a truce was agreed upon with Kęstutis. The deal fell through and more military attacks followed in 1352. Another truce, rather favorable to the Lithuanians, was signed in fall 1352: Lubartas received not only Volhynia and Podolia, but also Belz and Chełm. However, already in 1353, Liubartas attacked again. Casimir responded by organizing a large campaign against the pagan Lithuanians with a special permission from Pope Innocent VI. After the campaign did not achieve the desired results, Casimir contemplated an alliance with the Lithuanians. In 1366, Casimir, allied with Siemowit III of Masovia and nephews of Liubartas, resumed the war. As Algirdas was involved in conflicts in the east and Kęstutis fought with the Teutonic Knights, Liubartas had to defend alone and was defeated. In fall 1366, a treaty was signed: Liubartas retained only eastern Volhynia with Lutsk and became somewhat dependent on Poland . Casimir awarded his allies: Yuri, son of Karijotas, received Chełm, his brother Alexander received Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and Yuri, son of Narimantas, continued to rule Belz. How many years passed between Liubartas losing all territories except Volhynia and Lubartas being taken prisoner?","completion":"Liubartas lost all territories except for eastern Volhynia in 1348 after the Battle of Strėva. He was taken prisoner by Louis in spring 1351. To calculate the number of years that passed between these two events, subtract 1348 from 1351: 1351 - 1348 = 3 years So, 3 years passed between Liubartas losing all territories except Volhynia and him being taken prisoner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

John Starling Chapple was the office manager, joining Burges's practice in 1859. It was Chapple, designer of most of the furniture for Castell Coch, who completed its restoration after Burges's death. Second to Chapple was William Frame, who acted as clerk of works. Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff.William Gualbert Saunders joined the Buckingham Street team in 1865 and worked with Burges on the development of the design and techniques of stained-glass manufacture, producing much of the best glass for Saint Fin Barre's. Ceccardo Egidio Fucigna was another long-time collaborator who sculpted the Madonna and Child above the drawbridge at Castell Coch, the figure of St John over the mantelpiece in Lord Bute's bedroom at Cardiff Castle and the bronze Madonna in the roof garden. Lastly, there was Axel Haig, a Swedish-born illustrator, who prepared many of the watercolour perspectives with which Burges entranced his clients. Crook calls them \\"a group of talented men, moulded in their master's image, art-architects and medievalists to a man – jokers and jesters too – devoted above all to art rather than to business.\\" contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls?, what is it ?

Mylan, now in the crosshairs over severe price hikes for its EpiPen, said Thursday,... (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — Mylan, in the face of heated criticism over price hikes for its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment, is bulking up programs that help patients pay for the drug. The generic drugmaker laid out a plan on Thursday to expand its patient assistance program and offer 300 savings cards for its EpiPen 2-Pak. There is no change in the price of the treatment, however, which is what has drawn ire both in Congress and from families that have had to shell out increasingly large sums for the potentially life-saving treatment. Mylan has hiked prices for EpiPen as frequently as three times a year over the past nine years. A two-dose EpiPen package cost around 94 nine years ago but has climbed more than 600 percent to an average cost of 608 in May, according to the Elsevier Clinical Solutions' Gold Standard Drug Database. Mylan did not immediately return calls from The Associated Press early Thursday about the drug's price. Mylan N.V. said it's doubling eligibility for its patient assistance program, which it said will get rid of out-of-pocket costs for uninsured and underinsured patients and families. It also noted that the 300 savings card will cover about half the cost patients who would otherwise have to pay the full list price. Patients will also be able to order the injected emergency medicine for severe allergic reactions directly from the company, to help lower costs, Mylan said. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and members of Congress from both parties have been calling on Mylan to address the pricing. Pharmaceutical and biotech industries can fuel American innovation, and combat debilitating diseases, Clinton said in the statement Wednesday. But she added that \\"it's wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them.\\" Last year, more than 3.6 million U.S. prescriptions for two-packs of EpiPens were filled, according to data firm IMS Health. That earned Mylan nearly 1.7 billion. EpiPens are used in emergencies to treat severe allergies that can lead to anaphylactic shock. Roughly 40 million Americans have severe allergies to spider bites, bee stings and foods like nuts, eggs and shellfish. ||||| Drugmaker Mylan is promising to double the eligibility for its EpiPen assistance program following a pricing backlash from consumers, but the company stopped shorted of reducing or capping prices of the emergency allergy treatment.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Protesters rally for 2nd night against decision in Eric Garner case This article is published in partnership with Time.com. The original version can be found here. Thousands of protesters gathered in major U.S. cities for a second night Thursday to rally against the police-involved deaths this year of unarmed black men, just hours after New York’s mayor announced a citywide police retraining program and one day after the news that a white officer would not be indicted in the death of Eric Garner. A large and rowdy crowd gathered at Foley Square in Lower Manhattan, as similar protests popped up in Washington, D.C., Chicago and elsewhere, echoing demonstrations the night earlier. Garner died in July after officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in a chokehold, an aggressive move that is banned by the New York Police Department. Wednesday’s grand jury announcement, which came just over a week after a similar outcome in the Ferguson, Mo., case involving teenager Michael Brown, sparked an immediate outcry and led a number of activists and elected officials to demand a federal investigation. Attorney General Eric Holder announced Wednesday that the Justice Department had opened a civil rights inquiry into the incident, which was caught on video and later went viral. As footage of the rallies filled news segments Thursday evening, with many protesters chanting Garner’s final words “I can’t breathe,” his mother Gwen Carr opened up about her reaction to the grand jury’s decision not to indict Pantaleo. “I couldn’t believe that they came back and didn’t come back with probable cause to bring this case to trial. I couldn’t even answer a phone call,” she told CNN. “I just wonder… what video was they watching? Because obviously it wasn’t the one the whole world was watching.” Carr said she does not accept Pantaleo’s apology. “He was choking him and my son was begging for his life. That was the time for the apology. He should have got up off of him and let him breathe… I would have still had my son,” she added. “He has no regard for human life if this is the way he treats suspects.” She hopes that Pantaleo will still face charges in federal court.

Does \\"It has one of the highest consumption taxes in the world and taxes all imports in lieu of an income tax system.\\" correctly answer the question of What does it do in place of an income tax system?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"It has one of the highest consumption taxes in the world and taxes all imports in lieu of an income tax system.\\" correctly answers the question of what it does in place of an income tax system. This statement suggests that instead of relying on the income tax system, the referred entity has implemented high consumption taxes and import taxes to generate its revenue. Consumption taxes, often known as value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax, are levied on goods and services when purchased. In this case, the entity appears to have one of the highest consumption taxes globally, which can be seen as a substitute for income tax. High consumption taxes can encourage savings and discourage excessive consumption, thus impacting the overall economy. Import taxes are imposed on imported goods and services. By taxing imports, a country can control its international trade activities, protect domestic industries, and generate revenue from international transactions. This tax system can also encourage foreign businesses to produce their goods and services domestically, leading to an increase in domestic production and employment opportunities. In countries that replace income tax with consumption and import taxes, the government's main revenue source shifts from taxing individuals and corporations based on their income to taxing their consumption of goods and services. This tax system has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include promoting a more efficient allocation of resources, reducing tax evasion, and encouraging more savings and investments. On the other hand, the disadvantages include potential regressiveness, where lower-income individuals may end up paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes relative to wealthier individuals. The overall impact on economic growth, social welfare, and government revenue varies depending on specific tax rates and policy implementations. In summary, the statement accurately answers the question of what the entity does in place of an income tax system. It has one of the highest consumption taxes in the world and taxes all imports, shifting the tax burden from the income generation to consumption and international trade activities. This alternative tax system can have various economic effects and social implications, and its effectiveness depends on how it is designed and applied."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There were calls today to shut down the BlackBerry Messenger service which is thought to have played a key role in helping mobilise looters involved in the riots across London. Mike Butcher, a technology journalist and digital adviser to Boris Johnson, said it was 'unbelievable' that the BBM service had not been disabled. Messages on the service, along with posts on Twitter, helped spread the locations of riots like wildfire and brought hordes of teenagers together to attack neighbourhoods throughout the weekend. Hackney: Smash and grab - A man jump kicks a store front window to get in and loot. Hackney: Looters queue to get in to a convenience store to get hold of its goods. Hackney: Hooded thieves take what they can from inside the store. The messenger service on BlackBerry. handsets, an instant, cheap and safe form of communication, helped. galvanise looters across London and nationwide over the weekend. The. BlackBerry itself is now the smartphone favoured by young people in. this country, and is used by a massive 37 per cent of British teens. Unlike social networks like Facebook and Twitter, messages sent through BBM cannot be traced back to the sender's phone. For the majority of teens with BlackBerrys, BBMS has replaced regular SMS messages which still cost around 10p each to send. BlackBerry UK were forced to deny weekend reports that they planned to disable the service. Research. in Motion, the firm behind BlackBerry and BBM, instead said they would. ‘engage with the authorities’ following the riots. Today, Mr Butcher described the BBM. service as 'text messaging with steroids', as Blackberry itself denied. reports it had planned to disable the messenging service. Mr Butcher had tweeted last night: 'It is unbelievable that @UK_BlackBerry is not shutting down BBM right now.' He told the BBC Today programme this. morning: 'Mobile phones have become weaponised in their capability of. spreading information about where to target next. 'There is evidence that BBM is an. encrypted, very secure, safe, fast, cheap, easy way for disaffected. urban youths to spread messages for their next target. 'It's like text messaging with. steroids - you can send messages to hundreds of people and once it's. gone from your phone it cannot be traced back to you.' BlackBerry UK had to deny reports over the weekend that it planned to shut down the messenging service. The firm instead tweeted that it would help the authorities with their investigation. Mr Butcher said police need to communicate with phone firms like BlackBerry to help anticipate future disturbances. He added: 'BlackBerry itself has said these messages are very hard to trace. Obviously there is going to have to be some kind of communication between the police and companies like BlackBerry to try to get the information befre the riots happen'. Mr Butcher has since removed the tweet from his Twitter feed and qualified his comments on the Today programme by adding that 'you could not shut down BBM because information would still be rooted around'. Young looters were accused of an opportunistic ‘Supermarket Sweep’ motivated by nothing other than greed. Dozens were filmed as they disappeared into the night with their arms laden with plasma TVs, laptops and sports clothes. Claims that rampant lawlessness was motivated by the death of Mark Duggan at the hands of police was quickly exposed as a lie. Some of those involved in attacks on stores in Enfield, Tottenham and Oxford Circus were barely old enough to be arrested. Messages on social networking sites and mobile phones spread like wildfire and brought hordes of teenagers, many covering their faces with masks and hoods, to shops and high streets. In some areas they were left to roam freely, forming queues outside smashed stores and pausing to try on footwear. Pictures of the young thieves posing with their loot were soon posted on the internet accompanied by gloating messages. Last night on Rye Lane in Peckham, a mob of 30 black youths wearing bandanas forced open the metal grill of a jewellers before smashing their way into the shop. Croydon: An Argos store was smashed into and looted on Monday night. [caption. Should BlackBerry Messenger be banned after 'inciting' the riots? Should BlackBerry Messenger be banned after 'inciting' the riots? Now share your opinion. Children, who bystanders say could. have been as young as seven, rushed inside to grab what they could. Scotland Yard revealed that an 11-year-old boy is the youngest of more. than 215 people who have been arrested over the rioting. He has since. been charged with burglary. The vast majority of those arrested. for offences including burglary, violent disorder and theft were aged in. their teens or early 20s. Many. of those involved were rallied by calls spread through mobile phone. messages and social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One BlackBerry message urged people to arm themselves with hammers and to bring cars, vans and even trollies to help them cart off stolen goods. It added: ‘What ever ends [area] your from put your ballys [balaclavas] on link up and cause havoc, just rob everything. Police can’t stop it.’ Another message referred to Oxford Circus where a mob of about 50 youths attacked several businesses. A policeman said last night that children involved in the rioting and stealing were inspired by video game Grand Theft Auto. The 18-rated computer game is popular among teenagers, with many having the game given to them by their parents. In riot-hit Tottenham a police officer said: ‘These are bad people who did this. Kids are out of control. When I was young it was all Pacman and board games. Now they’re playing Grand Theft Auto and want to live it for themselves.’ The game, which is made by Edinburgh-based firm Rockstar North, has been criticised for depicting carjackings, drive-by shootings and prostitution. It has also been accused of encouraging juvenile crime in Britain. Players are expected to commit crimes and build up their power in a fictional city by selling drugs and killing rival gangsters. There have been fears that some gamers may try to recreate scenes from the games for real. It called on ‘everyone from all sides of London’ to meet up, smash up shops and get some ‘free stuff’, adding: ‘if you see a fed [police] ... SHOOT!’ Lambeth Council leader Steve Reed condemned the ‘opportunistic looting’ as ‘thieving on a mass scale’. He added: ‘Somebody described it as gangs of kids doing Supermarket Sweep’. This is a reference to the 1990s gameshow in which contestants raced round a store to get as many items in a trolley as they could in a limited time. ‘It was Curry’s where they were after plasma screen TVs and H&M and Foot Locker where it was clothes and trainers,’ said Mr Reed. ‘It was thieving on a mass scale. I’ve heard stories of people actually trying on clothes and using wheelie bins to fill with goods. It wasn’t about social issues, it was an opportunity to go on the rob.’ Police warned that those who used the internet and mobile phones to issue inflammatory rallying calls could face prosecution. Intelligence experts are scouring public messages for evidence of those behind the mayhem. But. they could be impeded by the increased use of encrypted BlackBerry. devices to spread calls to arms among networks of friends. It. has emerged that the ‘shadow social network’ played a key role in. co-ordinated violence in Enfield, Tottenham and Oxford Circus. Police. are trawling through a mass of evidence that some of the worst scenes. were co-ordinated by rioters using mobile phones and the internet. They fear incendiary messages urging thugs to arm themselves with knives and hammers were circulated via BlackBerry devices. Brixton: A pawnbroker is hit by a gang of hooded thieves as a photographer watches on. Brixton: A WHSmith shop on Brixton Road is one of several looted by hundreds of rioters. Dalston: Youths are seen running with boxes near near the area's Kingsland shopping centre. Further updates boasted that police were powerless to stop the carnage as lawlessness spread quickly across London. Looter: Pictures put on Twitter showed some of the rioters using shopping trolleys to carry away stolen items including TVs and mobile phones. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Kavanagh said those caught using Twitter, BlackBerry messaging and other sites to stir up violence could be prosecuted. Asked whether those responsible for ‘inflammatory postings’ could be arrested, he replied: ‘Absolutely. Whether it be verbal communication, a placard or Twitter. This is the emerging way that we do policing.’ The use of BlackBerry smartphones is a worrying development for police because they are very difficult to monitor. They were once the preserve of business people looking to check their emails on the move but the messenger application, known as BBM, has proved irresistible to teenagers. It offers a text message-style service which is instant, free and private where users can exchange updates with individuals or large groups. The application has also been seized on by criminals, and security conscious businesses, because it is very difficult to intercept. Several countries, including the United Arab Emirates and India, have complained that BlackBerry messages are too secure and may be used by terrorists. In Enfield, 17-year-old witness Alice said she received a message on her phone telling people to come armed with knives and hammers. She said: ‘It was all planned. On BBM. there was a broadcast to everyone, which goes to everyone on someone’s. contact list, telling us to meet up with weapons.’ Mark Duggan, whose fatal shooting sparked some of the violence, sent his last message via BlackBerry messenger. He. told his girlfriend that the ‘Feds are following me’ from the back of a. minicab just minutes before the deadly confrontation in Tottenham last. Thursday. A BlackBerry spokesman suggested that the company may help police trace those responsible for stirring up violence. He said: ‘We feel for those impacted by the riots in London. We have engaged with the authorities to assist in any way we can.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"In London, there were some riots and looters causing trouble. People believe that a messaging service on BlackBerry phones, called BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), played a big role in helping the looters come together and decide where to cause problems. This is because messages on BBM are private and can't be traced back to the person who sent them. Some people suggested that the BBM service should be shut down, but BlackBerry denied that they plan to do that. Instead, they said they would work with the authorities to help stop the riots."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: As last night's Republican presidential debate over national security issues demonstrated, credibility is crucial to winning a debate. Think of credibility like money you have in a bank. Each time you stretch it thin, you have less the next time you might need it. It is your own personal bank of believability. Knowing your arguments and facts is one way to gain credibility. Mitt Romney fattened his credibility bank account at the expense of Rick Perry, who supported a no fly zone over Syria. Romney argued that a no fly zone over Syria would be pointless since the Syrian government has 5,000 tanks. Romney jokingly said it would make more sense to impose a \\"no drive zone.\\" Jon Huntsman made a similar deposit when he stated that sanctions on Iran would not work since \\"the Chinese aren't going to play ball and the Russians aren't going to play ball,\\" and Iran has already decided to go nuclear. Huntsman's cited the examples of Libya (which gave up its nuclear ambition, and later the government was overthrown with the help of the United States) and North Korea (which has tested nuclear weapons and whose government is still in power.) Another way to maintain credibility is to cite proof for your arguments. Michele Bachmann has said things in previous debates (President Obama wants Medicare to collapse) and in last night's debate (suggesting that the CIA cannot interrogate terrorist suspects any longer because the ACLU is in charge) that were not very credible. These frequent ATM withdrawals hurt Bachmann because a lack of believability spills over. Her disagreement with Rick Perry about whether to give aid to Pakistan should have been an excellent point for her. She showcased her knowledge of the subject, saying that we exchange intelligence information and the United States must have our interest represented. Bachmann called Pakistan \\"too nuclear to fail,\\" and chastised Perry for being naÃ¯ve when he said he would not give Pakistan one penny until it proved it had America's best interests in mind. This was a terrific answer that warranted applause because it was thoughtful, logical and well reasoned. What did she get? Crickets. Why? Because her believability bank is in the red. Ron Paul is an enigma. He can provide such thoughtful answers at one time and later interject completely unsubstantiated statements. He was banking responsibly with his argument that the war on drugs was a failure and a reason for much of the violence in Mexico. Paul reminded us that prescription drugs kill many more people than illegal drugs do and that alcohol is a deadly drug. Paul's argument was factually accurate, even if unpopular with many conservatives. But then Paul writes an overdraft with moderate Republicans by saying things like aid to Africa for malaria or AIDS prevention is \\"all worthless.\\" Paul hit the daily double. Unpopular answer? Check. Wrong on facts? Check. There are countless examples of disease prevention aid being effective. Could aid be more effective? Sure. But that was not Paul's answer. He simply asserted that aid is worthless, but he had no proof. Answering questions with non-answers simply isn't credible. For example, Herman Cain twice last night reached into a very old bag of tricks to answer questions with the standard \\"I'd consult the experts\\" line. Actually, he originally answered a question about terrorist profiling with his support of \\"targeted identification.\\" But when asked a follow-up not 20 seconds later, he retreated by saying he would \\"ask the professionals.\\" Nothing hurts your credibility worse than flip-flopping on the same question and diving into a non-answer. Cain's bank account is probably under a thousand dollars. But that still leaves him 999. Finally, to save credibility, you should be prepared to defend your position when giving a potentially unpopular answer. Newt Gingrich had two answers that the conservative wing of his party might not like, but he defended them well. Gingrich said it was possible to cut some of the military because, \\"If it takes 15 to 20 years to build a weapons system when Apple changes technology every nine months, there's something profoundly wrong with the system.\\" And Gingrich went against the Republican current when he stated that some long-term illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay legally, but without citizenship, in the United States. Romney and others said giving amnesty would be a magnet for more people to come illegally to the United States. Gingrich said we should be humane, and he was ready to take the heat for his stance. Gingrich has enough credibility banked because of his stances on other issues that he was able to withstand the criticism on this one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Todd Graham.

PepsiCo Inc., the world #39;s No. 2 soft- drink maker, said third-quarter earnings increased 35 percent, boosted by sales in Asia and lower taxes.","completion":"This passage is about the financial performance of PepsiCo Inc., the world's second-largest soft drink maker, during its third quarter. PepsiCo is a multinational food and beverage corporation that produces a diverse range of products, including popular drinks like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade, as well as snacks like Doritos and Quaker Oats. The passage highlights a 35 percent increase in the company's earnings for the third quarter compared to the previous year. This significant growth can be attributed to two key factors: increased sales in the Asian market and lower taxes. Firstly, the expansion in the Asian market played a crucial role in PepsiCo's overall growth during the third quarter. Asia is a vast and growing market with a rapidly expanding middle class who are increasingly looking for new food and beverage options. This presents a significant opportunity for multinational companies like PepsiCo to introduce their products and cater to the region's evolving taste preferences. By tapping into this market, PepsiCo was able to achieve stronger sales, positively impacting its earnings. Moreover, lower taxes also contributed to the company's increased earnings during the third quarter. The reduction in taxes has multiple implications for PepsiCo. It can enhance the company's ability to invest in research and development, allowing them to develop innovative products which can help maintain a competitive edge in the global market. Lower taxes can also translate into increased profitability, facilitating the distribution of higher dividends to shareholders, attracting more investors, and ultimately driving the company’s stock prices higher. In summary, this passage discusses PepsiCo Inc.'s financial performance during the third quarter, which saw a 35 percent increase in earnings due to robust sales in the Asian market and lower tax rates. This positive outcome reflects the company's strong growth strategy and its ability to capitalize on emerging markets, as well as benefiting from favorable tax conditions. Such results are essential for the long-term success of the company as it strives to maintain its position as a global leader in the food and beverage industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A 56-year-old woman and her five-year-old grandson miraculously emerged with minor injuries from a car accident after they were both run over on Tuesday in Anapolis in the state of Goias, Brazil. A split second after the accident happens, the youngster gets up and walks over to his grandmother, who is lying on the floor, as if nothing has happened. Both are already home after the accident after being discharged from hospital suffering from minor injuries. The incident was captured on CCTV cameras, which show the moment Vilma do Nascimento and João Pedro Nascimento were hit when a runaway car collided with a stationery vehicle pushing it into their path. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. The car rolls right over the 5-year-old's head. The accident happened as the pair walked up an Anapolis street. The footage shows two people walking side by side in the road, just yards from the pavement. Up ahead, a car approaching the crossroads at speed from a road on the left of the screen crashes into another as it crosses the junction. Despite the efforts of the second car to swerve out of the way, the vehicle coming from the left fails to stop. The impact sends the car careering down the road where it collides with a stationery white car. Seeing the split-second accident unfold just metres in front of them, the grandmother grabs her grandson’s hand and rushes quickly towards the pavement in an attempt to avoid the car, which is hurtling towards them out of control. The white car barrels into Mrs Nascimento and João. The shocking footage shows how in a split second the pair were mown down. Miraculously the boy jumps straight back up and immediately goes to his grandmother's aid. But before they can reach safety the speeding car collides with the parked car shoving it into a reversed curved spin onto the pavement where it slams into the pair. The stationery car has been hit so hard, it races backwards only coming to rest seconds later after it has rolled over the victims twice – the body and head of the child and the legs and back of the women. Even as the accident is happening, the five-year-old manages to raise his head as he looks up to see where his grandmother has fallen – the lower half of his body is already under the car. A fraction of a second later the front wheel of the car rolls over the child’s head continuing over the grandmother’s back as she lays flattened on the floor by the impact. ‘I saw that the car run over him and come towards me. I thought my grandson’s skull had been crushed,’ Mrs Nascimento said in an interview with TV Anhanguera. But within seconds of it happening the youngster stands up making what appears to be an amazing recovery and walks over to his grandmother as if nothing has happened. The child later told reporters that he was more concerned about his grandmother than himself. ‘I thought my grandma had broken her spine and other things,’ he said. A passer-by who rushes to help the victims looks totally bewildered by what has just occured. ‘It was so quick. I tried to run to the sidewalk but unfortunately the stationary car hit us. It was a miracle we survived,’ the grandmother said. ‘I’m sure God’s hand protected us. João doesn’t even look like he’s been hit at all,’ she added showing off the bruises to her grandson’s face. Both are already home from hospital after undergoing a series of examinations. João was discharged on the same evening after the accident with minor abrasions to the right side of his face, chin and ear, and his grandmother was released Wednesday morning suffering from cuts and bruises to her legs and head. ‘The doctors said Joao’s injuries are just superficial. I’m not walking properly just yet but I have no fractures,’ Mrs Nascimento revealed. ‘It’s just amazing. João is already back playing with his friends and everyone is celebrating our survival.’ The drivers involved in the accident have both complained about the lack of signaling at the junction. The motorist who caused the accident denied speeding towards the intersection but admitted a degree of guilt. ‘I wasn’t paying attention as I approached the junction at the time but I don’t believe I was speeding,’ said Henrique Araújo, a sales representative. The other driver, João Birajara Camargo, also a salesman said: ‘I believe it was my right of way but I would have been able to avoid the accident if he hadn’t been speeding. I think he must have been doing at least 40kmph before he hit me.’ Anapolis local authority said it would be installing traffic lights before the end of the week.

Given the question: Article: In 1859, prefix = st1 /ItalyandFrancewere at war withAustria, and Henry Dunant, a young Swiss gentleman, came upon one of their battlefields. For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell. Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. \\"We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer.\\" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The \\"gentleman in white\\" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel. When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background. He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described. After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization. Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant. No man has deserved it more than the founder of the Red Cross. Question: Dunant planned the organization with an intention to _ .

(Meanwhile, a Real Housewives star's \\"explosive\\" custody trial has kicked off.) Expand this summary.","completion":"Arpad \\"Arki\\" Busson, the ex-fiance of actress Uma Thurman, has reportedly filed an emergency order to gain custody of their two-year-old daughter, Luna. The Manhattan court papers regarding the custody battle are sealed, making it difficult to determine the specifics of the case. Despite the public attention, Uma Thurman's representatives express their hope that a fair agreement for both parties will be reached out of court. The couple had split for the second time back in April, and since then, Busson has been dating actress Kristin Scott Thomas. Uma Thurman and Arki Busson, a London-based French financier, began their relationship in 2007 and announced their engagement in 2008. However, they briefly called off the engagement in 2009 before reconciling. In 2012, the couple welcomed their daughter Luna, but eventually called it quits for the second time in 2014. Thurman's representative stated, \\"It is unfortunate that this very private discussion regarding Mr. Busson's visitation rights and his participation in decision making has been made public.\\" The privacy of the custody proceedings is essential for the well-being of the two-year-old child, whose best interests should be prioritized in the decision-making process. Custody battles can often have long-lasting effects on the people involved, especially the children. Divorce and separation may create stress and emotional turmoil in a child's life. It is important for both parents to maintain a sense of routine and structure for their child's well-being. Co-parenting can be a challenge, but it is crucial for both parents to put their differences aside for the sake of their child's emotional and mental health. Busson is reportedly seeking visitation rights and decision-making power concerning Luna's upbringing. Ideally, the best outcome for everyone involved would be for both parties to reach a compromise and work together to provide the most stable and loving environment for their daughter. Uma Thurman is widely known for her roles in films such as \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" \\"Kill Bill,\\" and \\"Gattaca.\\" She has previously been married to fellow actors Gary Oldman and Ethan Hawke, with whom she has two children. Arki Busson has two children from his previous relationship with Australian model Elle Macpherson. He is recognized as a successful investor and philanthropist, and is the founder and Chairman of the EIM Group, a fund of hedge funds organization. As the custody battle unfolds, it is essential for both Uma Thurman and Arki Busson to prioritize their daughter's well-being and put her best interests at the center of their decision-making process. Hopefully, a fair and mutually agreeable resolution will be reached, allowing both parents to maintain a healthy co-parenting relationship and provide a loving and supportive environment for Luna as she grows up."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - William Craig ( November 13 , 1918 -- January 13 , 2016 ) was an American academic and philosopher , who taught at the University of California , Berkeley , in Berkeley , California . His research interests included mathematical logic , and the philosophy of science , and he is best known for the Craig interpolation theorem . - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation. - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east. - First-order logic also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as \\"Socrates is a man\\" one can have expressions in the form \\"there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man\\" where \\"there exists\\" is a quantifier and \\"X\\" is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers. - Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas: - In mathematical logic, Craig's interpolation theorem is a result about the relationship between different logical theories. Roughly stated, the theorem says that if a formula implies a formula , and the two have at least one atomic variable symbol in common, then there is a third formula , called an interpolant, such that every nonlogical symbol in occurs both in and , implies , and implies . The theorem was first proved for first-order logic by William Craig in 1957. Variants of the theorem hold for other logics, such as propositional logic. A stronger form of Craig's theorem for first-order logic was proved by Roger Lyndon in 1959; the overall result is sometimes called the CraigLyndon theorem. - Philosophy of science is a branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth. - The University of California (UC) is a public university system in the U.S. state of California. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also include the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System. - Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy investigating the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it. Metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions: - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - A public university is a university that is predominantly funded by public means through a national or subnational government, as opposed to private universities. Whether a national university is considered public varies from one country (or region) to another, largely depending on the specific education landscape. - Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics. It bears close connections to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems. Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory. These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science (particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see Logic in computer science for those. - A formal system or logical calculus is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics. A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\". - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - In mathematics, model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures (e.g. groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory) from the perspective of mathematical logic. The objects of study are models of theories in a formal language. A set of sentences in a formal language is called a theory; a model of a theory is a structure (e.g. an interpretation) that satisfies the sentences of that theory. - Foundations of mathematics is the study of the philosophical and logical and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics, or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics. In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague. Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (number, geometrical figure, set, function, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) owes itself to David Hilbert's attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics in the early part of the 20th Century. Metamathematics provides \\"a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic\\" (Kleene 1952, p. 59). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system. An informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition \\"2+2=4\\" as belonging to mathematics while categorizing the proposition \\"'2+2=4' is valid\\" as belonging to metamathematics. - The University of California, Berkeley, (also referred to as Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system, and is often cited as the top public university in the United States and around the world. - Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence or reality as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. Although ontology as a philosophical enterprise is highly theoretical, it also has practical application in information science and technology, such as ontology engineering. - Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge. - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. What is the relationship between 'william craig ' and 'proof theory'?

He finally works up the courage to approach her and express his feelings, but she rebuffs his advances. When he later accrues a 3,200 gambling debt to her, Consuelo agrees to hire him as her secretary to work off what he owes her. One of Terry's duties is to assume the role of her fiancé in order to discourage the insistent attention of Tony Barling, to whom Consuelo once was engaged, and to keep her from succumbing to her former beau's charms. Tony refuses to believe she loves someone else, and, when he recognizes Terry from the casino, his suspicions are aroused, despite Terry's outward displays of affection for Consuelo. Tony convinces her to join him on a friend's yacht, but Terry reminds her of his responsibility, and keeps her from going. Four weeks later, Consuelo finds herself still saddled with Terry, who has refused to accompany his songwriting partner Chappie Champagne to New York City to promote their latest tune. Consuelo insists she no longer has any interest in Tony, and offers to cancel the rest of Terry's debt so he can join Chappie. Terry departs, and moments later, Consuelo receives a call from Tony and invites him to the house.

While the visa-free and visa on arrival countries listed above offer easier entry for tourism purposes, obtaining a work permit may still require additional documentation and processes. However, some countries have more streamlined processes and favorable policies for skilled professionals, like designers. Here are a few countries where Indians may find it relatively easier to obtain a job as a designer and navigate the visa/permit process: 1. Singapore: The country's Employment Pass and S Pass programs offer a relatively straightforward process for skilled professionals. Singapore has a thriving creative industry and may have job opportunities for designers. 2. Germany: Germany has a program called the EU Blue Card, which makes it easier for highly skilled non-EU professionals to obtain a work permit. The country is known for its design industry, and there may be opportunities for Indian designers to find jobs. 3. Canada: The Express Entry system in Canada is designed to fast-track permanent residency applications for skilled workers, including designers. Moreover, a strong design industry and a multicultural population may make it easier for Indian designers to find jobs. 4. Australia: Australia offers a Skilled-Independent visa (subclass 189), which allows skilled workers to live and work in Australia as permanent residents. Indian designers with relevant skills and experience may find this a suitable option. 5. United Arab Emirates (UAE): Dubai, in particular, has seen a growing design industry in recent years. The UAE offers work visas for individuals with employment offers, and companies in the region may be more inclined to hire Indian professionals due to historical ties and geographic proximity. Please note that while these countries might offer a relatively more accessible visa and work permit process, it is essential to conduct thorough research and refine your job search strategy for each specific country. To answer the last part - No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question focuses on countries Indian passport holders can visit without having to obtain a visa, while the second question is about countries where it might be easier for Indians to find jobs as designers with relatively less visa/permit hassle. The first question pertains to travel, whereas the second question is centered around work opportunities for a specific profession."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Build a movie plot around this: What kid of job does Bob have? He is a truck driver. Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Miles of Destiny\\" Genre: Adventure/Drama/Family Plot Summary: Bob Johnson, a down-to-earth truck driver, discovers a hidden talent and embarks on a life-changing journey which affects not only his life but also the lives of those he meets along the way. He needs to balance his love for the road, responsibilities towards his family, and the pursuit of an unexpected passion as he navigates the winding highways of life, ultimately leading him to find his true purpose. Act 1: Introducing the Protagonist Bob Johnson is a dedicated truck driver with a kind-hearted nature but a mundane life. His job requires him to spend long days on the road, away from his loving wife, Susan, and their two children, Tommy and Emily. Despite the distance, Bob treasures his family and always looks forward to spending quality time with them on weekends. At a rest stop on one of his long hauls, he strikes up a conversation with an old man named Charlie - a retired jazz guitarist who once had a shot at fame but chose to walk away from it for a simpler life. Charlie inspires Bob with stories of his past musical experiences and introduces him to the world of jazz. As they part ways, Charlie leaves behind a harmonica, encouraging Bob to try it out. Act 2: The Discovery Bob, having never played a musical instrument in his life, is intrigued by the harmonica. He starts practicing whenever he gets time, eventually discovering his innate talent and love for music. His dedication to learning and improving earns him a local reputation, and he begins to perform at establishments on his driving routes. Back at home, his family struggles to cope with his growing passion and the time he invests in it. Susan tries to be supportive, but her patience wears thin as Bob's focus begins to drift from his family duties. Tensions rise as Tommy and Emily resent Bob's growing music career, feeling like he is valuing his newfound passion over spending time with them. Act 3: The Turning Point One night, during an impromptu performance at a run-down diner, Bob meets April, a talented and ambitious singer who dreams of making it big. They form an instant connection and start to perform together, their chemistry drawing significant attention. The word spreads, and they soon catch the eye of a major record producer who offers them a life-changing record deal. However, accepting the deal would come at a cost - Bob would need to quit his job as a truck driver and go on tour full-time, drastically changing the lifestyle he's come to know. This forces Bob to face the reality that pursuing his dream might mean putting his family life on the line. Act 4: The Resolution Bob struggles with his decision, but ultimately his love for his family prevails, and he decides to pass on the record deal. As a parting gift, April records a duet they had written together and gives it to Bob as a memento of their brief partnership. Back home, Bob sits down with his family and apologizes for his neglect. He vows to prioritize his family and rekindle the love and companionship that they once shared. The family slowly rebuilds their relationship, with Bob and Susan spending more time together, and Bob even teaching Tommy and Emily how to play harmonica. As time goes on, Bob discovers that he can balance both his love for music and his family responsibilities. He continues working as a truck driver but also starts a local band with fellow musicians, performing at community events and donating proceeds to local charities. The film concludes with Bob's band, \\"Miles of Destiny,\\" performing the song he co-wrote with April at a community fundraiser. As he looks out into the crowd, his eyes meet Susan's, and they exchange a genuine, loving smile, the harmonica solo in the background symbolizing both their unity and Bob's newfound balance in life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose from: (A). coastal range. (B). tidal range. (C). wave length. (D). apex.","completion":"(B). Tidal Range Tidal range is the measure of the vertical distance between the high tide and low tide at a specific location. To accurately determine the tidal range, measurements can be taken in the morning and evening when the tidal events have occurred. Tides are the periodic rise and fall of sea levels caused by gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth. Tidal forces cause the ocean's surface to bulge on the side facing the Moon and on the opposite side as well. This creates two high tides and two low tides each day, approximately 12 hours and 25 minutes apart. In order to calculate the tidal range, we need to measure the difference between the highest high tide (also known as the high water mark) and the lowest low tide (the low water mark) at a specific location. To accurately do this, we can take measurements at different times of the day. For example, if high tide is at 6 a.m., we would measure the water level at this time. Later in the day, at approximately 6:25 p.m., another low tide will occur, and we would measure the water level again. Comparing the two measurements of high tide and low tide will give us the tidal range. The difference between these two levels indicates the extent to which water levels change due to tidal factors at a specific location on the coast. In conclusion, the correct choice in this scenario is (B). Tidal range, which requires measurements to be taken in the morning during a high tide event and in the evening during a low tide event, in order to accurately determine the difference in the vertical distance between high tide and low tide."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B. and a hint : According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: Please answer this question : Which case would see faster movement, case A or case C? Answer:","completion":"Case A would see faster movement. In Case A, John observed planet Mars, which is closer to the Sun than Jupiter (Case C). The movement speed of a planet depends on its distance from the star it orbits. A planet's year (the time taken to complete one orbit around its star) depends on its distance from the star. The farther a planet is from its star, the longer the distance it must travel, and the slower its speed due to being less affected by the star's gravity. Mars is closer to the Sun compared to Jupiter. Therefore, it moves faster in its orbit around the Sun than Jupiter does. To summarize, Case A (Mars) would see faster movement than Case C (Jupiter) due to its closer proximity to the Sun, which causes it to have a stronger gravitational interaction and higher orbital speed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Game Hunters: In search of video games and interactive awesomeness To be part of the cast of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, you need to have a sense of humor, actor Nolan North told attendees at a Comic-Con panel devoted to the game. Development studio Naughty Dog played a near-finished cinematic from the game, due for PS3 Nov. 1, during the Friday panel. That was followed by footage of North, who plays main character Nathan Drake, and fellow actors Emily Rose (Elena Fisher) and Richard McGonagle (Victor \\"Sully\\" Sullivan) acting out the scene on the motion-capture stage. \\"We don't look good in these,\\" North warned. McGonagle quipped, \\"If any of you are wearing glasses, this will look a lot better without them.\\" Added North, \\"I believe I was retaining water at the time.\\" The video showed the three actors performing a scene wearing black neoprene body suits and skull caps with adorned markers. Props included a roll of black masking tape and sticks that doubled as an ancient artifact and shotguns. It was met with much laughter from the crowd, as were some outtakes showing the actors making grunting sounds that would be used for audio in other scenes. Rose joked, \\"I feel like someone just walked in on me in the bathroom.\\" \\"Now I know why you didn't show that to us first,\\" McGonagle said to creative director Amy Hennig. \\"We need to get paid a lot more,\\" North added. He explained that the outtakes were not \\"Drake in a bowel movement. … Sometimes we will just capture audio for Taylor's efforts,\\" nodding to fellow panelist Taylor Kurosaki, Naughty Dog's cinematic production lead. (Game Hunters' Mike Snider moderated the panel, which can be watched in its entirety via the above Gamespot video on YouTube.) North compared acting on the mo-cap stage to children playing. \\"We laugh more than you can imagine\\" doing the scenes, he said. \\"In its purest form, good acting is playing.\\" Naughty Dog has created an environment \\"for us to feel safe to be stupid like that,\\" Rose said, who along with North and McGonagle have been working on Uncharted games for five years. \\"It creates for great moments. We have to wear these spandex ball suits, and we have to really care about this round piece of tape (that stands in for the artifact). It creates a wonderful safe place to work and not every place is like that.\\" \\"It's the best job I've ever had,\\" McGonagle said. The rapport between the actors helps the video game come across as an ensemble, character-driven game. \\"The reason the characters are who they are is because they inhabit them,\\" Hennig said. Filming is much like stage performances \\"or like live television or three- or four-camera television where you are acting an entire scene out,\\" she said. \\"I think there is an immediacy there.\\" As many as eight or nine takes might be shot, along with additional audio. \\"It lets the actors play with the material in a way that maybe you don't get to in any other medium,\\" Hennig said. Animators take the raw mo-cap scene and fine-tune the characters, the environment, lighting and other effects. Recording the actors' speaking parts as they act out scenes together helps the studio achieve its goal of creating a cinematic action game. \\"We want people to feel like they are playing a movie,\\" said Naughty Dog's cinematic animation lead Josh Scheer. \\"We are making a game that is not only about running around ancient societies and blowing things up but also human characters with actual personalities and relationships. So much of that comes from the way that all of us have worked together over they years.\\" Among the questions asked the panelists by attendees was whether the cast would consider playing their characters in a movie. The crowd applauded and North pretended to dial his cellphone and said, \\"Get me Neil Burger, please.\\" Burger, whose most recent film he directed was Limitless, is currently working on adapting the first Uncharted game for film. Previously, David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg were attached to the project. When told his voice was \\"awesome,\\" McGonagle admitted, to laughs, that \\"the package is a little worn.\\" Reuniting for a film, Rose said, \\"definitely would be amazing.\\" North added that \\"after five years of doing this character and helping Amy create his persona, Nathan Drake for all intents and purposes is exactly who I am, personality-wise.\\" \\"With more upper body strength,\\" Hennig quipped. Said North, \\"I actually go to the rock-climbing gym now and it's hard.\\" North also revealed that he is working on a behind-the-scenes book called Drake's Journal, chronicling the game's development, that is expected to be released when the game comes out. Readers won't believe \\"the amount of stories from the office where these people put this game together,\\" he said. \\"I liken it to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. You don't know how they make the chocolate, but you love to eat it.\\" What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Please write a short summary for the following article: What Your CEO Is Reading: History of American Growth; Saving Globalization; Ancient Greece vs. 2016 Rio Every week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications. Make the summer games great again? With fears of Zika outbreaks, terrorist attacks and Guanabara Bay “floaters”, the news coverage run-up to the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, commencing tonight, reads like a trip through Dante’s Inferno…on Russian steroids. Could it be any worse? Well, yes, if one considers the original games in Greece, Foreign Policy’s David Clay Large suggests. Far from being a celebration of peace and amateurism, the games were bedeviled by fighting spectators–and the occasional invading army–smelly Spartans and Mt. Olympus-sized doping habits. “Their nostrums included dried mushrooms, exotic herbal concoctions, animal hearts and testicles, and even an opiates-laced juice cocktail,” Mr. Large writes. And while today’s athletes in Rio may have to contend with uncooperative plumbing, ancient athletes had it worse. “Swarms of black flies and other bugs infesting those microbe-laden latrines brought on epidemics of gastroenteritis and diarrhea, often fatal.” Why growth will fall. Or, Bill is bullish. This year’s summer read is an 800-page economic history book that “weighs as much as a small dog,” William D. Nordhaus writes in The New York Review of Books. “The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War,” by Robert J. Gordon, “one of America’s leading macroeconomists,” tracks the “special century” from 1870 to 1970 where living standards exploded. The book is trending on executive digital bookshelves, and not only for its economic analysis and history, but also for its argument, in the last 200 pages, that the rate of innovation since 1970 has slowed–Silicon Valley visionaries be damned. Mr. Gordon “sees no prospect that we will find a similar set of inventions of such breadth and depth in the near future,” Mr. Nordhaus writes. But Bill Gates, in a blog post, cares to disagree. “My money is on the incredible forces of technological progress at work every day.” Saving globalization and technology from themselves. As support erodes for globalization and technology, the engine’s behind today’s unparalleled prosperity, it is time for businesses to confront “the growing divide between winners and losers,” say Boston Consulting Group’s CEO Rich Lesser, and colleagues Martin Reeves and Johann Harnoss. They suggest a seven-point technology-heavy agenda for business leaders, starting with a new approach to globalization that goes beyond cost-cutting offshoring. “Technology will be crucial,” they write “For example, the use of analytics and robotics could bring manufacturing closer to target markets.” Ultimately, businesses need to “own the narrative,” making the case for globalization and technology but also addressing side effects. “It is time for a credible, inclusive, and trust-inspiring narrative, both for the direction of our societies and the sharing of benefits and opportunity within them.”","completion":"Worries about the Zika virus, terrorist attacks and pollution threaten to overshadow the Olympics Games in Rio de Janeiro, but such events were far from straightforward in ancient Greece either, writes David Clay Large in Foreign Policy. The ancient Games included land-grabbing spectators, large numbers of flies spreading illness and athletes who couldn't resist doping, says Large. While the rate of innovation since the 1970s has slowed, according to economist Robert J. Gordon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates begs to differ. As globalisation faces a decline, businesses need to confront the widening divides it has created, according to Boston Consulting Group’s CEO, Rich Lesser, and colleagues Martin Reeves and Johann Harnoss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What's the full name of the person whose secretary is in love with Mike's friend? World War II has ended and Major Larry Briggs finds out that his friend Captain Mike Perry has only two months to live due to a head injury. Larry and Sergeant Pete Rocco are determined to show Mike a good time before he dies. For a 10,000 fee, Larry takes a flying job working for Alex Maris, a profiteer. Everything is set until Maris' secretary, Susan Cleaver, shows up to board the aircraft. Mike falls for Susan and Larry convinces her to play along but she has fallen in love with Larry. The first flight is disrupted by Maris arriving a half-hour late with the police right behind. Larry takes off but is forced to make an emergency landing after both engines fail. After checking into a small hotel, the Americans find Police Lieutenant Keon, who is shadowing them, believing that they are smugglers. When Larry sees Mike falling for Susan, he wants the romance to end and despite her carrying 500,000 for Maris, Larry tells her to leave immediately. When Mike longs for Susan, Larry relents and blackmails her into seeing him or he will turn her into Keon. Sailing to Saigon on a boat, Larry tricks Keon by stowing the money away into an envelope he mails to himself, and throws all suspicion off Susan. In reaching Saigon, Larry knows he has fallen in love with Susan even though Mike has proposed to her. At Susan's hotel, an enraged Maris and his valet Simon, hold Larry hostage, demanding the money that has been posted. Bursting in, Pete realizes what is happening, and fights with Simon, but both men fall off a balcony to their deaths. Susan has secretly arranged to retrieve the money from the post office, returning it to Maris. Mike and Larry confront him but in an exchange of gunfire, Mike and Maris are killed. After Mike's funeral, Larry and Susan start a new life together.

Please briefly summarize this news article: ‘This Election Changed My Mind About America’ Here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment. 1. This is what unqualified looks like. [Trump] never expected to win and never planned to govern — he just loved the adulation he got from spreading his brand of hate. Now we have a completely unprepared administration trying desperately to do in 7 weeks what it should have been preparing for over the last 18 months. The disaster begins. — Mike K. in Santa Clara, Calif., reacting to an article about strife within Donald J. Trump’s transition team this week. This comment received more than 4,700 reader recommendations. 2. It seems that Billy Bush has been one of the few to be held accountable for his words and participation in the onslaught of racism and misogyny in the campaign and now post-election appointments. All others are ascending to the highest offices in the land. As a teacher I am already seeing the repercussions of having Teflon individuals in high office have no consequences for their bigoted remarks. When a student in my diverse classroom does not understand why it is hurtful to yell “build the wall” in the middle of class I can blame our leaders. The anti-Semitism, racism, misogyny will continue if we do not hold people accountable. — Sarah in Santa Rosa, Calif. 3. Bravo! Someone who understands the threat that Islam poses to the West. Let’s avoid the mistakes of France, Belgium and other countries where the dominating instincts of the world’s most dangerous religion have been allowed to flourish. — Mark in Los Angeles, reacting to an article about President-elect Trump’s choice of Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser. 4. Hey, I find it really ironic that all the groups that think they have a God-given mandate to enforce “tolerance” are so intolerant of controversial views and people that run counter to their own. Maybe the moral and ethical standards of Mr. Bannon are not that repugnant in the end, like Trump who has said some unfortunate things, as has everyone, that he regrets? If political correctness gets pushed to the maximum, business and progress grinds to a halt in fear of legal accusations that become paralyzing. How many lives have to be ruined by such enforced “correctness”? And what about the controversial manipulators on the other side like [George] Soros, who will hold them to account? — Nutmeg in Brookfield, Mass., reacting to an article about Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, whom President-elect Trump selected as his chief strategist. This comment received more than 100 reader responses. 5. Infrastructure spending, child tax credits, paid maternity leave and dismantling trade agreements....hmm, sounds a bit like some of Bernie’s platform. Slice and dice identity politics are all well and good but, in the end, it is all about the economy. And too many of our fellow citizens are hurting. Wake up, Dems, and return to the party’s FDR roots, or continue to lose. — Ellen Liversidge in San Diego. This comment received more than 390 reader recommendations. 6. This sad news hurts like the loss of a family member. Gwen Ifill’s clarity and moderate tone brought so much to the frantic Washington scene. This is the worst possible moment to lose her special gift for analyzing politics and bringing contending parties together in a civil conversation. — JL in Brooklyn, reacting to an article about the death of Gwen Ifill, the political reporter and PBS “NewsHour” co-anchor, on Monday. This comment received more than 2,200 reader recommendations. 7. I am considering many grad schools in the U.S. for my master course next fall. Before the election, I only looked at the ranking, the alumni’s feedback, the requirements and the fee and campus life. Now, I really have to think about the safety. As an Asian woman, I don’t expect anyone to stop me in the street and tell me to get back to China (which I am not from). So now, although I was so sure about some schools in Texas and Wisconsin, I have to sit down once again, and closely look at the cities, and hope that they are not too red. This election changed my mind about America. — Huyen Phuong Le on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to an article about foreign students questioning whether they should pursue a college education in the United States during the Trump administration. This comment received more than 60 likes. 8. Imagine, for a moment, you are a white male somewhere in America who just lost his job at a factory. Your mortgage is in default, your car is being repossessed, and you wonder whether you’ll be able to find a job, much less one that pays a decent wage. You have no particular animosity towards blacks, gays, women, but you constantly hear the message that as a white, straight male, you are the paragon of privilege and that the hardships in your life are irrelevant or made up. You don’t feel so privileged. Are your struggles and fears really so different from those of the minority groups? It’s easy to see why that person voted for the candidate who acknowledged his fears and against the candidate (and party) who dismissed his concerns because he was not a minority. — Andy in Scottsdale, Ariz., reacting to an Op-Ed essay about whether a focus on identity politics distorted the left’s message during the election. 9. I’m less patient with sexism and talking down and more likely to stand up for others. Gesture-wise, the day after the election, all of the young women in my office dressed in head to toe black. No one coordinated, no one knew that the other women would be dressed similarly, but we all were sending a conscious (sartorial) message of mourning, and it was comforting to see and feel that kind of solidarity. — Katey Laubscher on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to an article about the small gestures in which women found comfort in the days after the election. 10. This is a what locker room talk should be. — Alexa Carey on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to an article about three University of Wisconsin basketball players who have used their status as college athletes to boost political causes.","completion":"The top 10 comments of the week on the New York Times' digital platforms, as selected by readers and journalists, include reactions to Donald Trump's transition team, his choice of Lt.

Arrange all 'v' terms on one side of the equation: Combine the terms with 'v' on the left-hand side of the equation (17v - 134v), and on the right-hand side, we have (145v - 2358). 2. Combine 'v' terms: 17v - 134v = -117v (subtract 134v from 17v) So, we now have -117v = 145v - 2358. 3. Shift the -117v term to the right side of the equation, to combine all 'v' terms on one side. To do this, add 117v to both sides: -117v + 117v = 145v - 2358 + 117v 0 = 262v - 2358 (since 145v + 117v = 262v) 4. Next, isolate the 'v' term by shifting the constant term to the left side of the equation. Add 2358 to both sides: 2358 = 262v 5. Now, divide both sides by 262 to find 'v': v = 2358 / 262 6.

Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color. - An ice cube is a small, roughly cube-shaped piece of ice (frozen water), conventionally used to cool beverages. Ice cubes are sometimes preferred over crushed ice because they melt more slowly; they are standard in mixed drinks that call for ice, in which case the drink is said to be \\"on the rocks.\\" - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - First Sunday is a 2008 American comedy film written , produced and directed by David E. Talbert , and produced by Ice Cube , who also starred in the lead role . The film co-stars Katt Williams and Tracy Morgan . The film was released in the United States on January 11 , 2008 . Ice Cube , Katt Williams and Clifton Powell had all starred in the film Friday After Next . - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - Black comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo. Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes. Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor. - Morgan State University (commonly referred to as MSU, Morgan State, or Morgan) is a public research university and historically black college (HBCU) in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Morgan is Maryland's designated public urban university and the largest HBCU in Maryland. In 1890 the university, formerly known as the \\"Centenary Biblical Institute\\", changed its name to Morgan College to honor Reverend Lyttleton Morgan, the first chairman of its Board of Trustees who had donated land to the college. It became a university in 1975. MSU is a member of Thurgood Marshall College Fund. - David E. Talbert (born February 10, 1966) is an American playwright, author, and filmmaker.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more wind and rain would have a direct effect on the process. The increased wind and rain would lead to more erosion, resulting in an increased amount of sediment being detached from the soil. The stronger water currents caused by the additional rain would likely cause more sediment to roll downhill towards the river, potentially increasing the rate at which heavy items sink to the bottom. With more wind and rain, the turbulence in the water might also affect the lighter items. The increased turbulence can make it more challenging for them to float on the top and in convection cycles. As a result, less lighter items may float to the top. Furthermore, the stronger water currents due to the additional rain would likely move the sediment around more rapidly, potentially altering the distribution patterns of the sediment in rivers, lakes, and oceans.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: plastic wrap","completion":"When selecting the best solution for the goal of using plastic wrap, it is essential to consider the specific application or purpose for which it is intended. I will discuss two common plastic wrap solutions: standard plastic wrap and reusable silicone food wraps. I will evaluate these options based on several factors such as environmental impact, cost, versatility, and convenience. 1. Standard Plastic Wrap: Standard plastic wrap, also known as cling film or plastic film, is a thin plastic material, usually made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyethylene (PE). It is used for covering food containers or wrapping food items to keep them fresh and prevent cross-contamination. Advantages: - Standard plastic wrap is inexpensive and readily available at most grocery stores. - It easily adheres to various surfaces, providing an airtight seal that helps preserve the freshness of food items. - Due to its transparency, it allows users to easily identify the contents of wrapped food items. Disadvantages: - Standard plastic wrap is single-use, contributing to the increasing problem of plastic waste, especially given its non-biodegradable nature. - Punctures and tears can occur relatively easily, compromising the airtight seal. - Some concerns exist about the possibility of chemical transfer from PVC-based plastic wrap to food items, particularly when used in microwave ovens. 2. Reusable Silicone Food Wraps: Reusable silicone food wraps are an eco-friendly alternative to standard plastic wrap. Made from food-grade silicone, these wraps can be washed and reused multiple times. Advantages: - Reusable silicone food wraps contribute to significantly less plastic waste since they can be used multiple times, unlike single-use plastic wraps. - They are heat resistant, making them safe to use in microwave ovens or for covering hot containers. - Typically BPA-free, silicone food wraps do not release any harmful chemicals into the food, ensuring better food safety. - Their durability allows for a longer lifespan, meaning they can handle more frequent use without tearing or puncturing. Disadvantages: - Silicone food wraps are more expensive than standard plastic wrap, initially, but the price can be offset over time by their reusable nature. - They may not adhere as easily to some surfaces, affecting the freshness and airtight seal of food items. - They may not be as transparent as plastic wrap, which can make it difficult to identify the contents of wrapped items. When comparing these two plastic wrap solutions, it is evident that each has its advantages and disadvantages. However, considering the long-term implications and overall sustainability, reusable silicone food wraps are likely the better option. They offer an environmentally friendly, cost-effective (over time), and safer alternative to standard plastic wrap. As the world continues to grapple with increasing plastic waste and environmental concerns, the need to reduce single-use plastic items has become more pressing. By choosing reusable silicone food wraps, you can contribute to a more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle while ensuring the freshness and safety of food items. However, if you need a short-term solution or value initial budgetary savings, standard plastic wrap may be the more suitable choice for your needs. Ultimately, the best solution depends on your personal preferences, goals, and priorities when using plastic wrap."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The period marks the governance of the Muromachi or Ashikaga shogunate (\\"Muromachi bakufu\\" or \\"Ashikaga bakufu\\"), which was officially established in 1338 by the first Muromachi shogun, Ashikaga Takauji, two years after the brief Kenmu Restoration (133336) of imperial rule was brought to a close. The period ended in 1573 when the 15th and last shogun of this line, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was driven out of the capital in Kyoto by Oda Nobunaga. - Historical context. The goal of national unification and a return to the comparative political stability of the earlier Muromachi period was widely shared by the multitude of autonomous \\"daimys\\" during the Sengoku period. Oda Nobunaga was the first for whom this goal seemed attainable. Nobunaga had gained control over most of Honshu (see map below) before his death during the 1582 Honn-ji incident, a coup attempt executed by Nobunaga's vassal, Akechi Mitsuhide. It is not certain whether Nobunaga was killed in the attack or else committed seppuku. The motivations behind Mitsuhide's betrayal was never revealed to anyone who survived the incident, and has been a subject of debate and conjecture ever since the incident. - The is a period in Japanese history marked by social upheaval, political intrigue and near-constant military conflict.

Given the question: - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The last step of the process in the renal system after waste filtration and removal is the excretion of urine. After the waste has been separated from the bloodstream, the unwanted substances and excess water combine to form urine within the kidneys. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the final steps leading to the excretion of urine: 1. Collection and concentration of urine: The waste particles and excess water that have successfully filtered through the nephrons within the kidneys are collected in the renal pelvis. This filtrate is concentrated into a more viscous fluid by the reabsorption of the remaining water, electrolytes, and solutes in the renal tubules. 2. Urine transport through the ureters: Once the urine is collected and concentrated in the renal pelvis, it is transported via the ureters (which are muscular tubes extending from the kidneys) towards the urinary bladder. The ureters use coordinated muscular contractions known as peristalsis to propel the urine forward. This process ensures that urine is continuously and unidirectionally moved towards the urinary bladder. 3. Storage in the urinary bladder: The urinary bladder is a hollow, muscular, and expandable sac located in the lower abdomen. It stores the urine until suitable conditions for its expulsion arise. The walls of the bladder contain specialized muscle fibers called the detrusor muscle, which contracts or relaxes based on the volume of urine stored. The bladder can hold approximately 500 to 600 mL of urine. 4. Urine elimination through micturition: The process of eliminating urine from the body is called micturition or urination. When the bladder is filled to a certain capacity, it triggers a sensation for the need to urinate. This sensation is communicated to the central nervous system, which in turn responds by allowing the detrusor muscle to contract, and both the internal and external urethral sphincters to relax. Consequently, urine is expelled through the urethra and out of the body. To summarize, the last step of the process after waste removal in the kidneys involves collecting and concentrating the filtrate into urine, transporting it through the ureters, storing it in the urinary bladder, and finally, eliminating it from the body during urination. This efficient system ensures that the body maintains its fluid balance and proper functioning while simultaneously removing harmful waste substances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future. Rob always confuses the terms climate and weather. He found it's better to compare them if he needs to learn more about their characteristics. To make things easier, he labeled the weather of his city as char A. Then he labeled the climate of this city as char B.

For that, he labeled the climate of present time as char C and climate just before industrial revolution as char D. Does char A represent longer or shorter time period than char B? A:","completion":"Char A represents a shorter time period than char B. Char A refers to the weather of Rob's city, which describes temporary and short-term atmospheric conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Another factor is the functioning of the Union. This factor, the functioning of the Union, refers to the way in which a group of states or countries work together under a unified organization or system. There are multiple aspects to consider in understanding the functioning of a Union, including its political, economic, social, and legal dimensions. 1. Political dimension: The formation of a Union requires a consensus among its member states regarding the political structure, decision-making processes, and the distribution of power. Often, a Union would have a central governing body or a set of institutions that facilitate collaboration and coordination in areas such as foreign policy, defense, and political representation. The efficiency and effectiveness of these institutions significantly affect the functioning of the Union. 2. Economic dimension: A Union can also serve as an economic bloc that aims to promote trade, investment, and overall economic growth among its members. This can be done through the implementation of a common market, free trade agreements, or monetary policies. The functioning of the Union in terms of economic integration and collaboration can greatly impact its members' prosperity and competitiveness in the global economy. 3. Social dimension: The functioning of a Union also has social implications, as it can help foster a sense of common identity and shared values among its member states. This may lead to increased cooperation in areas like education, culture, science, and technology. Moreover, a Union can work towards promoting social cohesion and addressing issues such as migration, social inequality, and environmental sustainability, thereby contributing to the overall well-being of its members. 4. Legal dimension: The establishment of a Union typically involves the harmonization of laws and regulations among its member states. This process can enhance legal certainty and create a more predictable environment for businesses, citizens, and other stakeholders. The functioning of the Union in terms of the legal framework and the enforcement of common rules is essential for promoting trust, accountability, and the rule of law. In conclusion, the functioning of a Union is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses various dimensions, ranging from political to economic, social, and legal aspects. The effectiveness and success of a Union greatly depend on how well its institutions, policies, and mechanisms work together to address the diverse needs and aspirations of its members. As such, understanding the functioning of a Union is crucial for evaluating its potential benefits and challenges, as well as for informing decision-making towards its evolution and development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: By. Rob Cooper. Last updated at 7:44 PM on 14th December 2011. The News of the World’s ex-legal manager today insisted that he told James Murdoch there was 'direct and hard evidence' that phone hacking extended beyond a single reporter in 2008. Tom Crone said he showed the News International chief a printout of the now-notorious 'For Neville' email at a meeting also attended by the paper’s then-editor Colin Myler. The email, which contained transcripts of illegally intercepted voicemail messages, apparently showed that hacking went beyond a single rogue reporter. Email claims: Tom Crone, pictured giving evidence to the Leveson inquiry yesterday, today said he showed James Murdoch in 2008 there was evidence phone hacking went beyond a single rogue reporter. Mr Crone told the Leveson Inquiry that he had shown Mr Murdoch a number of documents which included the 'For Neville' message during the meeting on June 10, 2008. 'I cannot remember whether they were passed across the table to him, but I am pretty sure I held up the front page of the email,' he said. 'I am also pretty sure that he already knew about it - in terms of it had been described to him already, which I think the other documents that have come out suggest anyway.' Clive Goodman, the News of the World’s former royal editor, was jailed along with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire in January 2007 after they admitted intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides’ phones. Claims: James Murdoch was shown evidence that phone hacking was more widespread than just one reporter, Tom Crone said. Yesterday the inquiry was told Mr. Murdoch was sent emails which revealed that phone-hacking was ‘rife’ at the. News of the World in 2008. Mr Myler forwarded the executive an email exchange and added the note: ‘Unfortunately it is as bad as we feared’. Today Mr Crone said: 'What was certainly discussed was the email - not described as For Neville, but the damning email - and what it meant in terms of further involvement in phone hacking beyond Goodman and Mulcaire. 'And what was relayed to Mr Murdoch was that this document clearly was direct and hard evidence of that being the case.' Mr Murdoch has insisted that he was not shown the email or told that it proved phone hacking was more widespread at the News of the World than previously thought. The crucial 'For Neville' message is thought to have been intended for Neville Thurlbeck, the paper's chief reporter. The meeting with Mr Murdoch had been arranged to discuss a claim brought by Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive Gordon Taylor over the hacking of his phone by the News of the World, the inquiry heard. Former News of the World editor Colin Myler arrives at the Leveson Inquiry today. Mr Crone said he only 'temporarily' breathed a sigh of relief when the case was settled, adding: 'I was expecting another claim, frankly.' Explaining why the paper’s publishers agreed to pay Mr Taylor £425,000 plus costs, the lawyer said the company wanted to protect its reputation and reduce the likelihood of further expensive litigation. Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked him: 'This might also be interpreted as, to use a blanket term, a culture of cover-up. Would you accept that?' Mr Crone replied: 'No, I don’t think I would. It’s a culture of avoiding reputational damage through bad publicity, but it certainly isn’t a culture of cover-up if the damning documents are in the police’s possession and in fact came from the police.' Mr Crone also said he understood a representative of Madeleine McCann’s family gave the News of the World permission to publish the personal diary of the missing girl’s mother. Kate McCann told the inquiry last month that she felt 'violated' and like 'climbing into a hole and not coming out' when the intensely private journal appeared in the paper on September 14, 2008. Mr Crone said today: 'My understanding was that the representative of the McCanns had given the OK, the permission to the head of the newsdesk at the News of the World, to run the diaries or extracts from the diaries. I think he had emails to support that.' Mr Jay said: 'I have seen some documents which on one interpretation of them broadly support what you are saying.' Separately, appearing before the inquiry today, former News of the World editor Colin Myler said he 'did not recognise' much of the evidence given by Paul McMullan, the paper's ex-deputy features editor. Mr McMullan told the hearing last month that phone hacking was in the public interest, claimed celebrities often 'loved' being chased by journalists, and argued that 'privacy is for paedos'. Mr Myler said today: 'The criminality that took place, if it did take place, at the News of the World, is one thing, and whatever acts that individuals took part in, the full force of the law should take care of them. I'm sure it will. 'Mr McMullan often drifted off into a world of car chases, hacking phones, blagging, doing rather disagreeable things, and that is no world that I recognise.' Mr Myler took over running the News of the World in January 2007 after Andy Coulson resigned as editor when Goodman and Mulcaire were jailed.

Review: I first discovered Alexander Korda's (1940) Fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950's on a re-issue billed as \\"The Wonder Show of the Century!\\" Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program. The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films. The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in. True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950's. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor. The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it -- nice, but not as it should be. NOW comes the M-G-M DVD (3 Dec 2002) issue. THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING!!! It was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the DVD once, I watched it a second time. The only \\"Extras\\" are a Spanish Dubbed version, Sub-Titles in both English & Spanish, and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer. Thank you M-G-M for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release. Now, one can only hope that Korda's FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation) will soon follow on DVD. Now, what is this review like? pick from the following. A. negative B. positive","completion":"This review is B. positive. The reviewer describes their long-lasting admiration for the movie THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and how it has remained on their list as the best fantasy film ever made. They express excitement over the new M-G-M DVD release, particularly the restoration of the original Technicolor quality. The stunning visual presentation and the appreciation for the provided \\"Extras\\" contribute to the positive tone of the review.

Answer:","completion":"In the fall of 2010, both Arizona State University (ASU) and University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) had large enrollments, reflecting their status as major public research universities in the United States. However, based on available enrollment data, Arizona State University had a significantly higher fall enrollment count of more than 37,000 students compared to the University of Maryland, College Park. Arizona State University is a public research institution with its main campus located in Tempe, Arizona. Established in 1885, ASU has grown to become one of the largest universities in the United States. As of the fall of 2010, ASU's enrollment reached approximately 73,378 students across all its campuses, including undergraduate and graduate programs (source: National Center for Education Statistics). This statistic far surpasses the 37,000 students mark. The University of Maryland, College Park, is a public research university founded in 1856. It is the flagship institution of the University System of Maryland and is one of the leading research institutions in the United States. In the fall of 2010, UMD had a total enrollment of approximately 37,272 students, including 26,826 undergraduate and 10,446 graduate students (source: National Center for Education Statistics).

News article: The hunt for a possible \\"Nazi gold train\\" will begin next week with experts inspecting the suspected site for the first time. Rumours about two Nazi trains lost since the Second World War have long circulated but never been confirmed. This summer a pair of local treasure hunters in south-western Poland claimed to have stumbled across a site they insist contains an armoured train coontaining the gold. Poland's deputy culture minister, Piotr Zuchowski, said in August that he was \\"more than 99 per cent sure\\" one train was there after seeing ground-penetrating radar images. Officials have since cast doubt on the evidence. As of next week, however, experts will use measuring equipment and detectors to begin a \\"non-invasive\\" search of the ground. \\"The experts will be able to use different measuring equipment and detectors but are not allowed to touch the ground,\\" Arkadiusz Grudzien, municipal spokesman, told AFP. \\"They won't be able to dig, or drill or introduce cameras into the ground. They're only allowed to perform a non-invasive search\\". Up to three trains are believed by some historians to have arms, art, gold and archives onboard and to have disappeared near the Czech border as the Soviet army advanced in 1945. The suspected 18 square mile radius of their disappearance includes a network of underground tunnels dug out by prisoners of war, with some historians believing the Third Reich stashed treasure within them. Experts going out to explore the area will include the two men, Piotr Koper of Poland and Andreas Richter, a German, who originally said they had found the train. They claimed in August to have discovered a 98 metre long train carriage buried eight to nine metres underground in a railway tunnel after using ground-penetrating technology to scan the area. ||||| Poland 'Nazi gold train' investigators start surveying site in Poland Embankment to be searched with thermal imaging cameras to verify existence of possible cargo of stolen gold and artworks Polish military officials in September seal off the site near Walbrzych, where a second world war armoured train is believed to be hidden Engineers are set to start surveying a railway embankment in south-western Poland to establish how to dig out a “gold train” that is thought to have been buried there in the dying days of the Third Reich. The existence of a Nazi gold train, its whereabouts and its cargo – possibly stolen valuables and artworks – remain one of the great unsolved mysteries of the second world war. “In the past 70 years, three cold war secret services – the United States, the Russian, then the Polish – carried out searches,” said Piotr Koper, a 44-year-old builder who claims to have found the suspected armoured train with a fellow treasure hunter. “We succeeded because we are local people.” Some historians believe up to three trains laden with arms, art, gold and archives vanished in a 18 sq mile area near the present Czech border as the Red Army advanced in 1945. The strategic area includes Hitler’s command post at the grandiose Ksiaz Castle (formerly known as Fürstenstein) and Project Riese, a suspected secret weapons programme. Project Riese was a network of underground tunnels and chambers dug out beneath the Owl Mountains by an estimated 30,000 prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners. The earth embankment that will be surveyed this week by teams including one from Krakow’s mining academy rises up alongside the existing Wroclaw-Walbrzych railway line.

Photograph: Janek Skarzynski/AFP/Getty Images It will be checked with magnetic field detectors, thermal imaging cameras and radars. The site, on the outskirts of Walbrzych, has been under police guard since August when Koper and his friend, German-born Andreas Richter, showed the authorities images they had taken with a £7,000 ground-penetrating radar kit. “Four years ago, we were given information by a witness who was in Walbrzych at the time the train disappeared in April 1945. Radar technology has become affordable so we were able to check the information,” said Koper, who would not reveal if he knew anything about the hiding places of the other two supposed trains. “The Nazis dug out the embankment, created a junction and laid track to divert the train off to the side. Then they parked the train, which is 90 metres long, removed the rails and put back the soil.” Since August, the Polish military has cleared vegetation from an area the size of a football pitch. Soldiers have swept for mines and analysed the ground for the presence of poison gas. During the holocaust, Zyklon B – for use in gas chambers – is believed to have been transported on the line. The treasure hunters’ images show only the outline of what appears to be a train. “We do not know what is inside, only that it is armoured, which suggests a precious cargo,” said Koper. “There could be gold but that is not what interests us. In fact, we were looking for a tunnel when we found the train.” The men have hired a lawyer and applied to the Polish treasury for a reward of 10% of the eventual value of the train and its contents. “We have worked for four years to get to the bottom of legends that have flown around our city for 70 years. It has become a fascination,” said Koper, who added that he and Richter were well out of pocket for having self-funded all their research. But others in Walbrzych, a depressed coal mining town with smog-stained blocks of flats and 20% unemployment, are already cashing in. Initial reports of the discovery, in August, brought a stream of tourists bearing metal detectors. Walbrzych now has a Gold Train Car Wash, a Gold Train Skoda dealership and a line in souvenirs including fridge magnets, stickers, bags and gold ingot paperweights. At the city’s museum, there is a waiting list for gold train mugs. “I’m no Indiana Jones,” said the district governor, Jacek Cichura, “but my colleagues in the rest of Poland now call me the gold governor. We are in a special economic zone. Life is tough. The young people are leaving to work abroad. But the gold train has brought a tourism boom.” The influx of visitors is being felt across the district - from the towering Ksiaz Castle to the mist-clad Owl Mountains 10 miles (15km) to the south. According to local legend, the Führer’s castle lair is linked by at least one secret tunnel to Walbrzych and onwards to Project Riese’s underground network. Riese means giant in German, and this was where Hitler’s Wunderwaffe (magic weapons) were supposedly under development. It is unclear to what extent the underground mega city and arms factory actually functioned and how much of what we know is simply surviving propaganda. But for the past 12 years, carpenter Krzysztof Szpakowski, 56, has dowsed his way to uncovering thousands of metres of passages dynamited into the pine-clad Owl Mountains. Some tunnels are flooded but in others he has found German machine guns and prisoner-of-war graffiti. An eclectic mix of visitors – from militaria maniacs to bat fanciers – sign up for his guided tours. But Szpakowski himself has the exploration bug. He broke his arm last week when he slipped in one of the Riese’s dank, eerie tunnels. “This was a closed military area – first Russian, then Polish – until 1991. The soldiers were looking for something. When I was a teenager we knew something had gone on here. But there was no one to ask because all the [German] residents were shipped out of the area and replaced by Poles after the Potsdam agreement.” Szpakowski, Koper and Richter collaborate in their treasure-hunting by lending each other equipment. But they have different views of what is on board the “gold train”. Szpakowski believes it contains top-secret strategic equipment. He said: “The Nazis wanted to develop an atomic bomb. They were working on anti-gravity propulsion. There is something on that train that was intended for Riese. We only know 5% of what went on in this part of the world,” he said. ||||| Warsaw (AFP) - Experts will next week begin inspecting the site in the southwestern Polish city of Walbrzych where a Nazi train that could contain looted treasure is allegedly buried, the city said Thursday. A first group of experts, including the two men who claimed to have found the armoured Nazi train, will likely start their non-invasive search early next week, according to municipal spokesman Arkadiusz Grudzien. A second group from the Mining Academy in Krakow will follow suit, he said. \\"The experts will be able to use different measuring equipment and detectors but are not allowed to touch the ground,\\" Grudzien told AFP. \\"They won't be able to dig, or drill or introduce cameras into the ground. They're only allowed to perform a non-invasive search.\\" Treasure hunters Piotr Koper of Poland and Andreas Richter, a German, announced in August they had discovered a 98-metre-long (320-foot-long) train carriage buried eight to nine metres underground in a railway tunnel. They believe the contents are mostly weapons prototypes, though according to local legend they could also include artwork and Nazi documents. An army unit including a bomb squad completed tests at the site last month and declared it free of hazardous material. Deputy Culture Minister Piotr Zuchowski said in August he was \\"more than 99 percent sure\\" the train exists after seeing ground-penetrating radar images. But officials have since cast doubt on its existence, saying there was no credible evidence of it, without giving up their bid to verify the claim. Rumours of two Nazi trains that disappeared at the end of World War II have been circulating for years, capturing the imagination of treasure-hunters. The lore is fuelled by a massive network of secret underground tunnels near Walbrzych -- including around the massive Ksiaz Castle -- that Nazi Germany built and where legend has it the Third Reich stashed looted valuables. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The search for a \\"Nazi gold train\\" is set to begin next week near Walbrzych, Poland, with experts inspecting the site for the first time.

New York (CNN) -- A New York graffiti art exhibit that drew visitors throughout the world was painted over early Tuesday morning despite efforts by artists and fans to keep the popular outdoor attraction open. The whitewashing of the renowned graffiti haven known as 5 Pointz, a hulking warehouse in the Long Island City section of Queens, appears to mark the end of legal efforts by supporters to save it and even a last-minute attempt to secure landmark status for the building.

Even if you are against a person, it is important to have respect. It is this respect that makes us human. Without respect, we become animals. We need to respect our friends for our friendship.

If we want others to be good to us, we need to be good to them. After all, we give love to get love, right? Loyalty People often ignore the meaning and importance of loyalty. Loyalty is necessary for people to believe in each other. In no matter what kind of friendship, we need to believe in each other so that we can work together towards the same goal. Honesty Honesty is to show other people who we really are. Honesty helps to do better, because it makes us realize our problems and find ways to solve them.

Answer the following question: For a moment, Paul wasn't even sure who had walked into the room. Chloe had totally transformed herself since he'd last seen her. She wore a wig for starters, and a very good one. It was light brown and shoulder length. It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change. She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse. Her wrist sported what looked to Paul's uneducated eye like an expensive and fashionable gold lady's watch from which he thought he detected a glint of diamond. In short, she looked just like the high priced lawyer she was supposed to be. She was certainly the best-dressed person in the room. Chloe reached across the table to shake Greg's hand, stretching forward as she did so. Paul watched Greg glance down at her cleavage while he shook her hand. \\"I'm Rachel Roth, here on behalf of Mr. Paul Reynolds.\\" \\"Hi,\\" said Greg. \\"I'm Greg Driscol, and this is...\\" \\"I know the rogues gallery here,\\" said Chloe cutting Greg off and looking around at the assembled board members. \\"I've learned all about you gentlemen.\\" Marie stood up and shook Chloe's hand. \\"Marie Cooper, from Johnson, Myers, and Wick,\\" she said. \\"Nice to meet you,\\" she said. \\"Ok, we've got the intros down, shall we get on with the dirty business?\\" \\"Um, sure,\\" Greg said as he sat back down. \\"I was just about to turn things over to Marie.\\" The plan was now in action, and so far so good. But Paul knew that this was a crucial moment. Chloe didn't really know the law - just a few points that her friend had helped her out with. She couldn't let the real lawyer take over the meeting.

A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther.

A: Select from the following. [-] siltation. [-] filtration. [-] biodegradation. [-] bioremediation. The answer is:","completion":"Bioremediation. Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminated media, including water, soil and subsurface material, by altering environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade the target pollutants. In many cases, these microorganisms are already present at the contamination sites but aren't exposed enough to the pollutant to effectively degrade it. In such scenarios, bioremediation may be used to help increase population levels and pollutant degradation abilities. On the other hand, biodegradation is a natural process where organic substances are broken down by living organisms into smaller parts. While it's true that biodegradation involves microorganisms consuming pollutants, the term specifically refers to the natural, unaided process, whereas bioremediation includes intentional human intervention to promote the pollutant breakdown. Siltation and filtration are also processes related to the purification or cleaning of environmental resources, but they do not involve the use of microorganisms to consume a pollutant. Siltation refers to the pollution of water by fine particulate terrestrial clastic material, while filtration is the process of removing or reducing impurities from a substance, commonly a liquid or gas, by passing it through a medium that only the fluid can easily traverse."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s.

Martin Luther King Jr. was held in the Birmingham jail and was denied a consultation with an attorney from the NAACP without guards present. When historian Jonathan Bass wrote of the incident in 2001, he noted that news of King's incarceration was spread quickly by Wyatt Tee Walker, as planned. King's supporters sent telegrams about his arrest to the White House. He could have been released on bail at any time, and jail administrators wished him to be released as soon as possible to avoid the media attention while King was in custody. However, campaign organizers offered no bail in order \\"to focus the attention of the media and national public opinion on the Birmingham situation\\".Twenty-four hours after his arrest, King was allowed to see local attorneys from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out.

Article: An inventor seeks to create a new product that serves a specific need and fulfills a role that other products do not. Sometimes an inventor comes up with a wholly new idea, but more often inventions are simply improvements on an older design. With a little imagination and creativity , an old idea can suddenly become something new. However, creating a new invention means much more than having a brilliant idea. A good designer follows the design process: identifying the challenge, researching and brainstorming ideas , designing a solution, testing and evaluating the ideas, and finally building the product. Designers also use science, math, technology, and engineering to design a tool that satisfies the need they identified. Anyone can be an inventor --even kids! For example, Chester Greenwood was just fifteen years old when he invented a product that changed his life. In fact, his idea was so good that his invention supported him for the rest of his life. You may not know his name, but you probably know his invention --earmuffs ! The inspiration for his earmuff design came to Chester when he was ice-skating. His ears were cold, and he decided to find a way to keep them warm. With the help of his grandmother, he made a new product to protect his ears and at the age of eighteen, Chester patented his earmuff design. Many other famous inventors started young as well. Margaret Knight --the inventor of the flat-bottomed brown paper bag --is said to have created a safety device for textile looms when she was just twelve years old. Another example is Thomas Edison, one of the greatest inventors in history, who applied for his first patent when he was just twenty-one years old. Over the course of his life, Thomas Edison patented a total of 1,093 inventions! Question: The example of Chester Greenwood is used to show that _ . Options: A: children can also invent something B: it is easy even for children to make inventions C: kids have more advantages in inventing things D: to be an inventor is the best way to change one's life Answer:","completion":"A: children can also invent something"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Please answer this question : Who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm? Answer:","completion":"Kenny will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near his farm because he is currently using a low amount of fertilizer for his tomato crops, which are not in season. Bobby, on the other hand, has increased his use of fertilizer due to the large order of potatoes, which can contribute to more dead zones forming in nearby ponds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who wanted a much more progressive style than previous albums from the band for some time? In September 2010, Mikael Åkerfeldt stated that he was writing for a new Opeth album. The band announced on their website that they would start recording their tenth album on January 31, 2011, at the Atlantis/Metronome studios in Stockholm, once again with Jens Bogren (engineering) and Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree as co-producer.Shortly after mixing was complete on the new album in April 2011, Opeth announced that Per Wiberg was relieved of his duties in the band. In the press statement, Mikael Åkerfeldt explained the decision, saying, \\"Mendez, Axe and Fredrik and I came to the decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this came as no surprise to Per. He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so you could say it was a mutual decision. There's no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that's that.\\"Opeth's tenth album, Heritage, was released on September 14, 2011, to generally favorable reviews. The album sold 19,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release and debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart. Heritage debuted at number four in the band's native country of Sweden.Heritage became the second Opeth album to not feature any death growls and had a much more progressive style than previous albums from the band, something that Åkerfeldt had been wanting to do for some time.The first two songs Åkerfeldt wrote for Heritage were in the style of Watershed. After hearing the songs for the first time, Martín Méndez told Åkerfeldt that he would be disappointed if the album continued in that direction. Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for Heritage, Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that he felt as though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Michael has become bored with his passive life style, and has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby. He begins to exercise with weights several times a week. Michael's brother, Robert, isn't as motivated as Michael though. Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months. But I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. What is an answer for this question: Who will increase the size of their muscles less? Answer:","completion":"Robert will increase the size of his muscles less. This is because he exercises with weights only every couple of months, which is not frequent enough to develop and maintain bigger, stronger muscles. In contrast, Michael's decision to take up weightlifting as a hobby and exercising several times a week will lead to a consistent increase in his muscle size and strength, as the regular resistance training challenges his skeletal muscles. Since continued exercise is necessary to maintain muscle growth, Michael's more active lifestyle will result in greater improvements in muscle size compared to Robert's mostly inactive approach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me the answer to gossip girl who does georgina end up with??","completion":"Georgina Sparks, played by Michelle Trachtenberg, is one of the recurring characters in the popular TV series \\"Gossip Girl,\\" based on the book series by Cecily von Ziegesar. Throughout the series, Georgina has a dramatic and twisted storyline which includes multiple relationships, scandals, and schemes. By the end of the series, it is revealed that Georgina ends up with Philip Becker. Philip Becker, portrayed by actor Matt Doyle, is a minor character making his first appearance in the show's fourth season. His storyline crosses paths with Georgina during a time when she finds herself pregnant, claiming the baby's father is a Russian named Serge. However, through a series of interactions and discoveries, it is eventually revealed that the baby's father is not Serge but rather Philip. Georgina and Philip are initially introduced to each other by chance, and it quickly becomes clear that Philip is entirely enamored by Georgina and her wicked charm. Georgina ultimately decides to reveal her true identity to him, and in turn, Philip supports her with her many ploys and schemes. The couple faces many trials and tribulations together throughout the series, but notably, they always manage to find their way back to one another. Not much is known about Philip's character, as he is not as prominently featured as Georgina in the series. However, it is evident from his support for Georgina's antics and resilience in dealing with her chaos that he is a loyal and steadfast partner. In the series finale, it is mentioned that Georgina and Philip are still together, attending the wedding of Blair Waldorf and Chuck Bass. Their relationship has presumably grown stronger with time, overcoming the various obstacles that life in Manhattan's Upper East Side presents. While Philip's subdued nature might seem like an unexpected match for Georgina's chaotic personality, the pairing provides a unique balance between the two characters. Georgina's love life throughout \\"Gossip Girl\\" is tumultuous, to say the least. However, her connection with Philip showcases a more enriching and stable relationship. Despite coming from different backgrounds and having contrasting personalities, they complement each other and ultimately find love, trust, and partnership within their pairing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Food went for thrice its cost to those waiting near the entrance. Water went for five times as much. The arena was as old as the city, built in the days of the old empire for a king now long forgotten. The octagonal arena was a machine, an engine that built warriors out of the raw material of flesh, blood, and steel. Now, thousands of years later, it still served that purpose. The machine had built Dan Trex's army, half a million of the most ruthless and well trained soldiers to ever walk the planet. While one hundred and fifty thousand civilians and slaves got drunk, gambled, shat, fucked, and slept on the stone steps; one hundred thousand of his men sat in silence wearing black and bronze and watching him as Trex walked out into the arena alone and unhelmed. His soldiers watched the games in silence. They made not a sound when twelve of the most beautiful girls to walk on small bare feet were raped and flayed apart by dark priests in a ritual to Gazu Kadem's god-king, Danken Ovelde. They studied the three-horned desert bull as it gored five slaves. They watched the spear technique of four slave armies as they warred in a single great battle.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","completion":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. Before we analyze the impact of the supposed perturbation, let's recap the process of forming ravines. The formation of ravines typically involves a series of stages that lead to the development of deep and narrow channels that cut into the landscape. These stages are as follows: 1. A stream or river must occur: This is the initial phase where water starts to flow, forming a channel. 2. Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock: The flowing water carries sediment and other materials that erode the bedrock and soil, resulting in the channel deepening. 3. Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through: Over time, the channel becomes deeper and narrower as more material is removed by the erosion process. 4. After many years, the river may dry up: Eventually, the water source feeding the river may diminish, causing it to dry up. 5. A dry ravine is left: The final result is a dry ravine, which remains as an indication of the former river and the powerful erosive forces that shaped it. Suppose the mother does not get an abortion. While it is not a direct factor affecting the formation of ravines, it could indirectly influence the process. The presence of more people could lead to changes in land use, water consumption, and management of natural resources. Potential consequences include: 1. Altering water flow: An increase in the number of individuals may lead to higher water consumption for agricultural, industrial, or domestic purposes. This could affect the amount of water available in a river system and, in turn, influence the amount of erosion that takes place. 2. Changing land use: A growing population could result in land being converted to agricultural or urban usage, leading to deforestation and the removal of vegetation. This might impact the stability of the soil, accelerating erosion and increasing the likelihood of ravines forming. 3. Magnifying human impact: The indirect effects of a larger population may exacerbate ecological disturbances, such as pollution and habitat destruction, which could compromise the overall health of the river system and its ability to support the formation of ravines. It's essential to note that these indirect impacts do not directly modify a particular step in the process of ravine formation. Rather, they create broader, more complex changes in the surrounding environment that can influence the formation of ravines on a larger scale."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less steam is created happens, how will it affect MORE/LARGER nests. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The process of nest-building by birds typically involves the following steps: 1. The bird picks a tree 2. The bird collects twigs and other refuse 3. The bird makes a flat base with twigs 4. The bird makes sides with twigs and other things 5. The bird adds softer material to the inside 6. The nest is done. Now, let us consider the perturbation hypothesis: \\"suppose less steam is created happens, how will it affect MORE/LARGER nests\\". The perturbation scenario seems to be focused on the presence or absence of steam in the environment. To evaluate the potential effects of the assumed perturbation on the nest-building process, it is essential first to understand the role of steam in nest construction (if any) and the scenarios in which steam could be produced. Steam is formed when water is heated to its boiling point and undergoes a phase change from liquid to gas. There are few instances where steam could naturally occur in a bird's nesting environment: 1. Geothermal features such as hot springs or geysers might create areas with steam. 2. Steam could be produced by human-generated sources like industrial processes, power generation, or heating systems. In the context of bird nest-building, steam is not an essential component of the construction process. The materials typically used by birds - twigs, leaves, plant fibers, mud, and other found materials – do not have a direct relationship with steam or its effects. As a result, it is unlikely that the presence or absence of steam would have a direct impact on nest-building. However, there could be indirect effects of the presence or absence of steam on the construction of MORE or LARGER nests. For example: 1. If less steam is produced in a particular area, it might indicate an overall reduction in human activities and industrial processes. This could lead to a cleaner environment, which could indirectly benefit bird populations by improving air quality, reducing pollution, and giving them access to more natural resources to build their nests. 2. The availability of water sources might influence nest-building. An increase or decrease in steam production could affect the availability of water sources nearby the nesting sites, which could lead to more or fewer birds inhabiting the region. Improved access to water sources could encourage birds to build larger and more complex nests. 3. In the case of birds that tend to build their nests near geothermal features like hot springs, less steam production could signal changes in geothermal activity. This could impact the surrounding vegetation and microclimate, which might influence the materials and location choices for nest-building. Birds may need to adapt their construction techniques or materials to suit the changing environment. In conclusion, the presence or absence of steam does not have a direct effect on the process of nest-building by birds. However, there could be indirect effects on the construction of more or larger nests through environmental changes, access to natural resources, or shifts in suitable habitats caused by changes in steam production. It is important to consider the specific habitat, species of birds, and local conditions to determine the potential impacts of changes in steam production on nest-building behavior."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Witness to Alleged Jerry Sandusky Rape WILL Coach for Penn State on Saturday The man who witnessedallegedly rape a pre-teen boy in thelocker room in 2002 WILL be allowed to continue as a receivers coach when the team plays Nebraska on Saturday ... this according to the new Penn State head coachBradley was just officially introduced as Joe Paterno 's temporary replacement -- and stated, \\"Right nowwill be coaching on Saturday.\\"McQueary was a 28-year-old graduate assistant in 2002, when he claims he witnessed Sandusky raping a little boy in the Penn State showers. McQueary reported the incident to Joe Paterno -- but never called police.Paterno -- who also did NOT go to the cops -- was fired last night for not living up to his moral obligation to the child.Bradley says he was unsure if McQueary will be coaching from the sidelines or if he will be up in the booth on Saturday. ||||| STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — When Mike McQueary went to Penn State Coach Joe Paterno ’s house on the morning of March 2, 2002, he was a graduate assistant — the lowest rung on the coaching ladder beneath Paterno. Still, McQueary, 28 years old and a football lifer, had aspirations of one day becoming a head coach, maybe even at Penn State. A former quarterback for Paterno, he had once been a fan attraction for his shock of bright orange hair and his State College roots. Popular and known for an easygoing, collegial manner, he was beginning the baby steps toward his dream job. Nine years later, what McQueary told Paterno at that meeting — he had seen a former senior football coach molesting a young boy in the football building’s showers — has figured prominently in the most ignominious episode in university history. On Wednesday night, Paterno, who had hoped to remain as coach for the final three games of the season, was fired. Graham B. Spanier, the highly regarded and long-serving president of Penn State, was removed. Penn State’s athletic director has already been charged by the authorities. The campus is in turmoil. And there is a football game Saturday that could determine the team’s season. In an ugly episode that has torn at the soul of a proud university, set off criminal investigations and ended the career of one of the sport’s most accomplished and revered coaches, McQueary has occupied among the strangest of positions: he could be the star witness in the coming criminal cases against senior officials at the university; he has become the target for widespread criticism for not having acted more decisively himself nine years ago; and he could well be on the sideline Saturday for the game against Nebraska, helping execute a game plan devised by the coach he once dreamed he might succeed. A Penn State victory would leave it in position to reach a major bowl game. Jerry Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator under Paterno, has been charged with sexually abusing eight young boys over a 15-year-period. According to findings laid out by state investigators, only two Penn State employees were known to have witnessed Sandusky committing a sex crime: a janitor, who now has dementia and is not competent to testify, and McQueary. “It’s not that he’s not willing,” John J. McQueary, his father, said about his son’s public silence. “I think it’s eating him up not to be able to tell his side, but he’s under investigation by the grand jury. He’ll make it. He’s a tough kid.” McQueary’s parents, John and Anne, moved the family to State College when Mike was 6 and immediately bought season tickets for Nittany Lions football games. A former medical corpsman with the Navy’s special warfare operations, John became a physician assistant, and later, the chief operating officer of a large medical and surgical group in State College. He was also a renowned coach in the State College area himself in youth sports. When Mike turned 13, his father talked the Penn State quarterback, John Shaffer, into coming by Mike’s birthday party to throw a football with him. As a gift, Shaffer threw Mike a new football as he left the party. Tom Cestone, who lives on the cul-de-sac where the McQuearys raised their family, said his principal recollection of Mike was that he was always playing football in the yard. “He was a fiery kid,” Cestone said. Another neighbor, 87-year-old Virginia Walker, said she also recalled Mike playing football with friends. “He comes from a close family, a nice family,” she said. “He’s a real decent kid, and he’s always been somewhat of a leader.” In high school, McQueary was a star, and as a senior he led the State College Area High football team to a 13-1 record. “He set high standards for himself and he was stellar in his attitude, his principles and his goals,” said Ron Pavlechko, who was the State College Area football coach for 19 years and later became the school’s athletic director. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The article discusses the case of Mike McQueary, a former Penn State assistant football coach who allegedly witnessed the rape of a pre-teen boy by Jerry Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator, in the locker room in 2002. McQueary reported the incident to head coach Joe Paterno but did not contact the police. Paterno, who also did not report the incident to law enforcement, was subsequently fired. Despite widespread criticism, McQueary continued to serve as a receivers coach during a game against Nebraska. The case led to the firing of other senior university officials, including Penn State President Graham B. Spanier, and has caused turmoil within the university and its football program. McQueary potentially holds a significant role as a witness in the criminal cases against the implicated officials, while also dealing with the backlash for not taking more decisive actions when the incident took place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lake will have less dead zones? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.","completion":"Based on the given information, Lake Costanza is likely to have fewer dead zones compared to Lake Montopeke. The reason for this can be explained by the differences in rainfall patterns experienced by the two farms neighboring these lakes. The farm next to Lake Montopeke receives rain on a regular basis, which leads to more frequent dissolving of fertilizers in the soil. As this dissolved fertilizer gets carried away by runoff, it ends up in Lake Montopeke. This process leads to an increased presence of nitrogen in the lake, which facilitates the growth of algae. When these algae die, decomposers utilize the oxygen in the water, ultimately creating dead zones in the process. In contrast, the farm adjacent to Lake Costanza hardly experiences any rainfall. This results in less dissolution of fertilizer in the soil and consequently less runoff carrying it into Lake Costanza. With a lower concentration of nitrogen entering the lake, there would be less algae growth, leading to fewer dead zones. In summary, due to the difference in rainfall experienced by the two farms, Lake Costanza is expected to have fewer dead zones than Lake Montopeke."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: STOCKHOLM, Oct.11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese writer Mo Yan has won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature, announced Peter Englund, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on Thursday. The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 is awarded to Chinese writer Mo Yan \\"who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary,\\" said Englund at a press conference. Mo Yan, a pseudonym for Guan Moye, was born in 1955 and grew up in Gaomi in Shandong province in eastern China.His parents were farmers. As a 12-year-old during the Cultural Revolution he left school to work, first in agriculture, later in a factory.In 1976 he joined the People's Liberation Army and during this time began to study literature and write.His first short story was published in a literary journal in 1981. \\"In his writing, Mo Yan draws on his youthful experiences and on settings in the province of his birth.This is apparent in his novel Hong gaoliang jiazu (1987, in English Red Sorghum 1993),\\" said the academy in a statement of Mo's biography. The book consists of five stories that unfold and interweave in Gaomi in several turbulent decades in the 20th century, with depictions of bandit culture, the Japanese occupation and the harsh conditions endured by poor farm workers, according to the biography.Red Sorghum was successfully filmed in 1987, directed by famous Chinese director Zhang Yimou. Through a mixture of fantasy and reality, historical and social perspectives, Mo Yan has created a world reminiscent in its complexity of those in the writings of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, at the same time finding a departure point in old Chinese literature and in oral tradition, the academy commented in the biographical statement. In addition to his novels, Mo Yan has published many short stories and essays on various topics.In spite of his social criticism, he is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, the statement added.

John has been struggling with the memories of his deceased wife, Sarah, and two children, Emily and Max. Seven years ago, they were all brutally murdered in their home, an incident that occurred during the weekend he was on a business trip. John is riddled with intense guilt and plagued by vivid nightmares of their murders. One day, at his regular therapy session, John's psychiatrist, Dr. Miller, suggests an experimental drug that might help him overcome his traumatic memories. John hesitates but ultimately decides to take the drug, hoping to find some solace in his life. Act 2: After starting the drug treatment, John experiences a dramatic change. His nightmares become more vivid and frequent, and he starts seeing glimpses of his family around town. Confused and scared, he seeks help from Dr. Miller, who is genuinely puzzled by these symptoms. Dr. Miller suggests John to stop taking the drug and continue with therapy. However, while wandering through town one day, John sees a woman who looks strikingly similar to his deceased wife, Sarah. He follows her until she enters a house, which turns out to be an old abandoned mansion on the outskirts of the town. He watches her from afar, and upon a closer look, John is convinced - she is Sarah. Obsessed with unveiling the truth, John starts investigating the past. He finds an old newspaper article about a spiritualist group that used to live in the mansion. Rumor has it that they could bend reality and erase memories. Act 3: John, now obsessed with the mystery, teams up with a young journalist named Kate, who has been researching the spiritualist group for her article. Together, they discover the group's dark history and the shocking truth - some of the spiritualist group members are still alive, hiding in plain sight throughout the town. By delving deeper into the mysterious occurrences, they unveil the horrifying truth. The spiritualist group had abducted John's family to perform an experimental ritual, wiping out their existence from everyone's memories, including John's.

Complete the passage. (CNN)Twelve years ago, Rachel Miller was lost when it came to her son John. The 7-year-old was profoundly disabled because of his autism. Unable to speak, he withdrew from people at school and, worse, from his family. In March 2003, Miller was introduced to Jeff Hancock, a one-on-one therapist for people with autism, and things started to feel a little more manageable. Hancock was hired to be John's companion. The two would go people-watching at the mall in Stuart, Florida, on the weekends. Hancock chatted throughout their excursions, even though John couldn't talk back. Their relationship evolved when Hancock introduced John to the Special Olympics in Martin County. Hancock, a longtime volunteer for the organization, and Miller decided John should get involved in sports after they saw a rare sight: Whenever John was running or being active, he was smiling. Jeff probably saw that with us,\\"","completion":"Miller speculates, thinking back on their early days together. \\"He must have noticed that sports had a big impact on John, that they brought him joy and helped him break out of his shell.\\" According to Miller, that was when they knew they needed to find an outlet or activity through which John could expand his horizons and fully tap into his potential. As it turned out, the Special Olympics turned out to be the perfect platform for John's transformation. With Hancock's guidance, John began participating in a variety of sports and activities specially tailored for people with intellectual and physical disabilities. In the beginning, John's primary focus was on track and field events. He found a sense of empowerment and enjoyment through running and jumping, which helped further develop his physical capabilities and boost his self-confidence. Over time, he expanded his repertoire to include basketball, swimming, and even volleyball. In each sport, John received guidance and support from qualified coaches and volunteers at the Special Olympics, who were committed to helping him grow both athletically and personally. \\"John's progress was nothing short of remarkable,\\" Miller recounts. \\"His social skills improved dramatically, and he began making friends through the organization. He still couldn't communicate verbally, but he had developed a non-verbal language, a way of connecting with others that transcended words.\\" An essential factor in John's growth was the bond he formed with Hancock. Having a one-on-one therapist who was dedicated to exploring his passions and overcoming his challenges made a significant difference in John's life. Hancock became not only a source of support for John but also a mentor, a friend, and a role model. \\"Jeff truly believed in John, and he instilled that belief in him,\\" Miller says. \\"That sense of confidence and trust began to permeate every aspect of John's life. He started to believe in himself and recognize his own abilities, and that was truly priceless.\\" Over the years, John's participation in the Special Olympics has had an immeasurable impact on his life. He has won numerous medals and awards, which fill the family's trophy case, but more importantly, the organization has helped him discover the incredible potential he held within. The once withdrawn, non-communicative boy has transformed into a confident and proud athlete who has made lifelong connections with friends, teammates, and coaches. As for Rachel Miller, she can hardly put into words the gratitude she feels for both the Special Olympics and Jeff Hancock. \\"They have given my son a chance to shine, to find his place in the world, and to achieve things we never thought possible,\\" she says. \\"The Special Olympics has changed our lives, and we will forever be thankful for the opportunities and the memories it has given us.\\" As John continues his journey through the world of sports and beyond, one thing remains constant – the unwavering love and support of his family, especially his mother Rachel Miller. Together with the Special Olympics and outstanding individuals like Jeff Hancock, they have paved the way for other families facing similar challenges, proving that there is hope, and that even with profound disabilities, one can still find joy, success, and a sense of belonging in this world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Time is in the Chicago Park District, in the Washington Park community area on Chicago's South Side, near the Midway Plaisance. This location, adjoining the University of Chicago campus directly to the East, makes the sculpture a contributing structure to the Washington Park federal Registered Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Time is considered to be the most important piece of monumental art in the Park District, which hosts over 100 art works. Its importance stems from its sculptor, its message, the era in which it was created, and the design of its reflecting pool by Howard Van Doren Shaw. Robert Jones, director of design and construction for the Art Institute of Chicago at the time, stated in 1999 that Time was the first finished art piece to be made of any type of concrete.The sculpture is located a few blocks from Taft's studio, the Lorado Taft Midway Studios, now a Chicago Landmark and National Historic Landmark, located at 60th Street and Ingleside Avenue. Other notable sculptures nearby include Henry Moore's National Historic Landmark Nuclear Energy, which is on the site of the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance...

Make this proper case.","completion":"The region watered by the Sepik River is a fascinating area that holds immense interest for the lifestyle and culture of its inhabitants. These communities have unique customs involving their relationship with crocodiles which play a significant role in their culture and identity. Crocodiles are considered to be sacred creatures by the people living along the Sepik River. This belief has shaped their practices and traditions in a variety of ways. One of the most striking examples of the crocodile's influence on the local culture can be seen in the practice of skin scarification. This process involves making deliberate cuts on a person's body to create elaborate patterns that resemble the rugged skin of a crocodile. Skin scarification is performed primarily on young men, usually during their initiation into adulthood. The process is not only about aesthetics but also serves as a rite of passage. It is an essential part of their cultural identity and is believed to imbue them with the strength and power of a crocodile. Despite the social and cultural significance of this practice, there are instances where individuals may struggle to control the infection caused by the cuts made during the scarification process. Proper hygiene and medical care are vital for avoiding complications, but accessibility to these resources may be limited in certain areas along the Sepik River. A lack of sterilization at the time of the procedure, as well as inadequate aftercare, can result in infections that, if left untreated, can lead to severe consequences. Infections can cause the affected area to become swollen, red, and painful, potentially posing a risk to the individual's overall health if the infection spreads. Although there are risks associated with the practice of skin scarification, it remains a deeply rooted cultural tradition for the communities living along the Sepik River.

Implementarea unor măsuri de control eficiente la frontierele României este esențială pentru menținerea sănătății animalelor și pentru protejarea industriei agricole și a lanțului alimentar. Focarul de febra aftoasă (FMD) reprezintă o amenințare serioasă și are repercusiuni negative asupra sănătății animalelor și a economiei. Această boală virală extrem de contagioasă afectează majoritatea speciilor clovențate, putându-se răspândi foarte rapid. Prin menținerea unor controale riguroase privind importurile și monitorizarea atentă a animalelor, putem contribui în mod semnificativ la prevenirea răspândirii acestei boli și la minimizarea pierderilor economice în cazul unui focar. Unele dintre măsurile pe care guvernul ar trebui să le adopte pentru a intensifica controalele la import ar fi: 1. Informarea agențiilor de control la frontieră și a importatorilor despre importanța verificării și controlului tuturor produselor de origine animală care intră în țară. 2. Creșterea numărului de controale ale autorităților competente pentru a monitoriza importurile de animale și produse alimentare. 3. Consolidarea reglementărilor privind procedurile de control la frontiere, inclusiv revizuirea legilor, regulamentelor și normelor adoptate în acest domeniu. 4. Acordarea de resurse adecvate pentru a spori capacitatea infrastructurii și instruirea personalului implicat în controalele la import și supravegherea bolilor animalelor. 5.

For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb? The answer to this question is:","completion":"To determine which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb, I will compare their energy consumption and efficiency. Step 1: Understand the types of lights mentioned. - A vapor light typically refers to a high-intensity discharge (HID) light, like a high-pressure sodium (HPS) or metal halide (MH) lamp. These lights produce light by creating an electric arc through vaporized gases. - A regular light bulb generally refers to an incandescent light bulb that produces light by heating a filament wire to a high temperature until it glows. Step 2: Compare energy consumption and efficiency. - Vapor lights (HID lights) are more energy-efficient compared to regular incandescent light bulbs. Vapor lights produce more lumens per watt, which means they produce more light while using the same amount of energy. In other words, they use less energy to produce the same amount of light as an incandescent light bulb. The answer to this question is: the vapor light is more energy efficient than the regular light bulb."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: If I tell you that Inorganic substances are essential for body processes, and ask you the question \\"what are essential for body processes?\\", is the correct answer \\"light energy\\"? The answer is:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"light energy.\\" The correct answer is \\"inorganic substances\\" and other essential nutrients. Inorganic substances, such as water, minerals, and electrolytes, are indeed essential for various body processes. They play vital roles in maintaining the body's proper functioning, including fluid balance, bone formation, nerve transmission, and muscle function. In addition to inorganic substances, there are also organic nutrients that are essential for body processes. These include: 1. Carbohydrates - They are the primary source of energy for the body, providing fuel for physical activities and brain function. 2. Proteins - They are the building blocks of the body and are essential for growth, maintenance, and repair of cells, tissues, and organs. 3. Fats - They are a secondary source of energy and are essential for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, hormone production, and insulation of the body. 4. Vitamins - These are organic compounds, needed in small amounts, that play critical roles in metabolic processes, immune function, and overall health. There are two categories of vitamins: fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and water-soluble (B vitamins and vitamin C). 5. Light energy - Although not a direct nutrient, light energy is essential for maintaining the body's circadian rhythm and the synthesis of vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight. In summary, essential nutrients for body processes include inorganic substances such as water, minerals, and electrolytes, as well as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and vitamins. Light energy also plays a role in maintaining circadian rhythm and vitamin D synthesis, but it is not considered an essential nutrient in the way inorganic substances are."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How does an aircraft carrier stop itself and how long does it take to come to a complete stop? How does an aircraft carrier stay level? Do those questions have the same meaning? Choose your answer from: * no * yes","completion":"The answer is \\"no\\". The questions have different meanings. The first question is about the process and duration of an aircraft carrier coming to a stop, while the second question is about how an aircraft carrier maintains its level during operation. 1. How does an aircraft carrier stop itself and how long does it take to come to a complete stop? Step 1: Cut Engine Power To stop the aircraft carrier, the first step is to reduce its engine power. This will slow down the ship, gradually reducing its forward momentum. Step 2: Apply Reverse Thrust Next, the process of applying reverse thrust may be utilized. The propellers of the ship can be reversed, generating thrust in the opposite direction. This will help to slow the ship down more quickly. Step 3: Use Anchors If needed, anchors can be deployed to help bring the aircraft carrier to a complete stop. Anchors create significant drag through water resistance, helping to slow the ship down. Step 4: Consider Factors The time it takes for an aircraft carrier to come to a complete stop depends on various factors, including its speed, displacement (size/weight), and weather conditions. On average, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier can take about 3-5 minutes to stop, traveling at around 30 knots, and covering approximately 1 mile of distance before coming to a complete stop. 2. How does an aircraft carrier stay level? An aircraft carrier stays level primarily through a well-designed hull, advanced ballast control systems, and sophisticated stabilization systems. Step 1: Hull Design The hull of an aircraft carrier is designed to provide a large, stable platform that is able to evenly distribute weight across the water surface. The ship's overall shape and size help to keep it level in most conditions. Step 2: Ballast Control Inside the hull, there are chambers that can be filled or drained to adjust the weight distribution of the ship. By adjusting the ballast, it is possible to maintain a level position despite changes in the weight and distribution of equipment, aircraft, and personnel. Step 3: Stabilization Systems Modern aircraft carriers are equipped with advanced stabilization systems such as fin stabilizers and/or gyroscopic stabilizers. These systems help to counteract the rolling motion caused by waves and wind, keeping the deck as level as possible during operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.

Context: The United States occupation of Nicaragua from 1912 to 1933 was part of the Banana Wars, when the US military forcefully intervened in various Latin American countries from 1898 to 1934. The formal occupation began in 1912, even though there were various other assaults by the U.S. in Nicaragua throughout this period. American military interventions in Nicaragua were designed to stop any other nation except the United States of America from building a Nicaraguan Canal. Nicaragua assumed a quasi-protectorate status under the 1916 Bryan-Chamorro Treaty. But with the onset of the Great Depression and Augusto C. Sandino's Nicaraguan guerrilla troops fighting back against U.S. troops, it became too costly for the U.S. government and a withdrawal was ordered in 1933.

The Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George is a British order of chivalry founded on 28 April 1818 by George, Prince Regent, later King George IV, while he was acting as regent for his father, King George III. It is named in honour of two military saints, St Michael and St George. The Order of St Michael and St George was originally awarded to those holding commands or high position in the Mediterranean territories acquired in the Napoleonic Wars, and was subsequently extended to holders of similar office or position in other territories of the British Empire. It is at present awarded to men and women who hold high office or who render extraordinary or important non-military service in a foreign country, and can also be conferred for important or loyal service in relation to foreign and Commonwealth affairs. The Order includes three classes, in descending order of seniority and rank: It is used to honour individuals who have rendered important services in relation to Commonwealth or foreign nations. People are appointed to the Order rather than awarded it. British Ambassadors to foreign nations are regularly appointed as KCMGs or CMGs. For example, the former British Ambassador to the United States, Sir David Manning, was appointed a CMG when he worked for the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and then after his appointment as British Ambassador to the US, he was promoted to a Knight Commander (KCMG).

Choices: - burned - polished - carved - composted - nailed The rationale to choose \\"polished\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Polishing a piece of wood involves smoothing and buffing its surface, often applying a glossy finish, like lacquer or wax. This process can make the wood's surface reflective, allowing you to see your reflection in it. Here's a brief explanation for each of the choices: - Burned: When wood is burned, it turns into charred and blackened material with an uneven surface. This doesn't create a reflective surface, so you won't be able to see your reflection. - Polished: As mentioned earlier, polishing a piece of wood smooths and buffs its surface while often adding a glossy finish. This process creates the potential for a reflective surface where you can see your reflection. - Carved: Carving wood is a process in which material is removed to create a specific design or shape. Carving does not necessarily make the surface reflective, and it could even create a more uneven surface. Therefore, you're unlikely to see your reflection in a piece of carved wood. - Composted: Composting is a process in which organic materials, like wood, decompose into a nutrient-rich material to enhance soil quality. During this process, the wood breaks down and loses its original form, so it won’t have any reflective surface for you to see your reflection in. - Nailed: Nailing refers to the action of fixing or joining objects together using nails. This doesn't involve altering the surface of the wood to create a reflective surface, so you won't be able to see your reflection in a piece of nailed wood. In conclusion, among the given choices, \\"polished\\" wood would be the most likely option to create a reflective surface where you can see your reflection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the concept behind the app is fascinating, it suffers from several issues that hamper the overall user experience. For one, the app tends to crash frequently, especially when browsing through the art gallery, which can be quite frustrating. Additionally, the customization options are limited and do not provide the level of personalization that I was hoping for. The user interface is also somewhat outdated and could use a fresh redesign to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly. Moreover, some gallery categories are incomplete or have low-resolution images, which detracts from the overall enjoyment of the artwork on display. On the plus side, the app does offer an interesting variety of artwork and can serve as a decent source of inspiration on days when you're feeling less creative.

Article: Every day on the road, accidents are caused. They do not only happen. The reason may be easy to see: an overloaded tray, a shelf out of reach, a patch of ice on the road. But more often than not there is a chain of events leading up to the misfortune-frustration, tiredness or just bad temper-that show what the accident really is, a sort of attack on oneself. Road accidents, for example, happen frequently after a family quarrel, and we all know people who are _ , so often at odds with themselves and the world that they seem to cause accidents for themselves and others. By definition, an accident is something you cannot predict or avoid, and the idea which used to be current, that the majority of road accidents are caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers, is not supported by insurance statistics. These show that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness. It is not always clear, either, what sort of conditions make people more likely to have an accident. For instance, the law requires all factories to take safety actions and most companies have safety committees to make sure the regulations are observed, but still, every day in Britain, some fifty thousand men and women are absent from work due to an accident. These accidents are largely the result of human error or misjudgment-noise and fatigue, boredom or worry are possible factors which contribute to this. Doctors who work in factories have found that those who drink too much, usually people who have a high anxiety level, run three times the normal risk of accidents at work.

As it turned out, Greg would have had a hard time canceling the check, even if he'd changed his mind. Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees.

Hypothesis: The Huntsville State Prison will be executing an Canadian Citizen","completion":"Based on the context provided, we can draw the following hypothesis: The Huntsville State Prison is scheduled to execute a Canadian citizen, Mr. Stanley Faulder, on December 10, 1998. The context indicates that the House is requesting the government to convey their concerns about the violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in Mr. Stanley Faulder's case. The violation in question appears to have occurred due to his status as a Canadian citizen. The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations is an international treaty that defines a framework for consular relations between independent countries, and part of its mandate is to ensure that foreign nationals who are arrested or detained receive essential information regarding their right to communicate with their consular post. In the given context, it seems that the case of Mr. Faulder might have overlooked this provision. Furthermore, the House is requesting not only that their concerns be conveyed to the governor of the state of Texas, Hon. George W. Bush, and the parole authorities of the state but also that they express their respectful request for the execution to be stayed. The reason behind this request is to ensure that due process has been followed and that a judicial review of the case takes place before any irreversible action is carried out. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the Huntsville State Prison will be executing a Canadian citizen, specifically Mr. Stanley Faulder, is supported by the context provided. However, it should be noted that the House is actively attempting to address the violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in this case and is seeking a stay of execution pending a judicial review to ensure that due process has been followed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who completed the first high-rise building in Chicago? ? The Monadnock was commissioned by Boston real estate developers Peter and Shepherd Brooks in the building boom following the Depression of 1873–79. The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888.

Article: The casual Friday concept was one of the first signs that strict dress rules for offices were starting to relax. The principle of casual Fridays seems to have appeared around the 1950s. It was probably in response to the changing attitudes towards workplaces. Over time, some offices have relaxed their dress rules even more by using a \\"business casual\\" dress rule. On casual Fridays, employees may wear clothes which are considered to be \\"business casual\\", meaning they still obey certain standards . Clothes must be clean and in good condition, with no spots. Men are generally allowed to wear casual trousers and bright-colored clothes, and in some offices they may be allowed to wear button-down shirts or polo shirts, with or without a tie. Women often wear neat skirts or dresses; casual trousers are common and generally allowed to wear, except in very formal workplaces. As a general rule, extremely casual clothes, like jeans, shorts, T-shirts, tank tops, and so on, are not encouraged on casual Fridays. Employees are still expected to make an effort to look professional, out of respect for their offices and their customers. Many people feel that casual Fridays are good for employees'mood because they encourage employees to express their individuality and feel more comfortable in the offices. Others feel that business casual clothing and the concept of casual Fridays don't show respect for the workplaces. Casual Fridays are dealt with differently, depending on the industry and the nation.

Summarize this article: Jason Rezaian, a 38-year-old dual Iran-US citizen, and his Iranian wife Yeganeh Salehi, were taken into custody on Tuesday evening, the paper said. Two freelance photographers, also US citizens, were being held too. Western news organisations, including the BBC, have great difficulty operating in Iran, with journalists facing detention and surveillance. \\"We are deeply troubled by this news and are concerned for the welfare of Jason, Yeganeh and two others said to have been detained with them,\\" Washington Post foreign editor Douglas Jehl said in a statement. Mr Rezaian, who is from California, has been the Post's Iran correspondent since 2012. Ms Salehi works as a correspondent for the National, an English-language newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates. Their detention was confirmed by Iran's Chief Justice Gholamhossein Esmaili, who said they were being questioned but did not give a reason for the arrests, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Mr Esmaili said the judiciary would release more details on the detention following \\"technical investigations\\", and said Iranian security forces are \\"vigilant towards all kinds of enemies' activities\\". The detentions of Jason Rezaian and Yeganeh Salehi came as the Iranian authorities step up pressure on independent journalists and bloggers. A number of people have been summoned to Tehran's Evin prison in recent months on charges of involvement in propaganda against the state. Those detained include four female reporters - Marzieh Rasouli, Sajedeh Arabsorkhi, Reyhaneh Tabatabaei and Saba Azarpeik. The media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders says there are currently 64 journalists and social media users imprisoned in Iran. The Iranian authorities have long kept the media under strict control, but arrests and intimidation intensified after the 2009 democracy protests. When President Rouhani took office in August 2013 a number of reporters were released from prison, and Ministry of Intelligence representatives in his new cabinet seemed to have taken a more relaxed approach towards the media. But at the same time journalists have come under renewed pressure from the judiciary and the Revolutionary Guards, who operate outside the government's jurisdiction. President Rouhani has so far said nothing about the latest wave of arrests. A reporter in Tehran for a Western news outlet who has been a friend of Mr Rezaian for five years said the couple had expressed no concern over their security or fears they would be detained. \\"They were just working hard and only talked about how they enjoyed reporting from here,\\" the reporter told the BBC. \\"This is also a surprise, because the atmosphere in general had appeared to become more open for foreign news outlets, at least, with more foreign journalists getting visas and accreditation.\\" Threats against BBC The reporter said that the handful of dual-national journalists operating in Iran are now quite nervous following Mr Rezaian's detention. Authorities in Iran frequently detain or harass journalists working for Western news organisations, and westerners with dual citizenship are typical targets. Iran-based family members of BBC journalists have been questioned by intelligence services, and authorities have attempted to intimidate London-based BBC Persian staff by setting up false Facebook pages on which BBC staff members purport to admit to sexual misconduct or to spying for the UK. Last year, Iran warned the families of 15 BBC Persian Service journalists that their relatives must cease working for the BBC in London, and in some cases the lives of the staff were threatened. In 2009, Iranian-American reporter Roxana Saberi was held for five months after being arrested for purchasing a bottle of wine. She had worked as a freelancer for the BBC and for US radio network National Public Radio. The same year, a reporter for AFP was held for several days. Summary:","completion":"A man named Jason and his wife Yeganeh, who are both reporters, were taken into custody along with two other people. The place where they live, Iran, can be difficult for reporters because sometimes they get detained and watched. People are worried about their well-being, and it is not clear why they were arrested. This is happening in a time when Iran is putting more pressure on journalists, and many of them have been sent to prison. Things seemed to be getting better for foreign journalists lately, but this latest arrest has made some of them nervous."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I want to clarify a few things. I am not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai movies, and I am very familiar with art cinema; I grow up in the seventies times of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. Art movies then were really ART; like paints. People did it to express their inner feelings, not really worried about if other people understand anything. They were beyond commercial values; just look some old Antonioni (or early Picasso) and you will understand. Tian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with that. It is an opportunistic movie, intended to fool festival judges and critics, playing many things without saying anything. The story makes no sense. The lack of water makes the government to promote the use of watermelons to hydrate. A girl in desperation, steal water from the public bathrooms WC. There is also a porno start (neighbor) trying to make a movie with an actress he does not seems to feel comfortable with. There is some romantic awakening between the girl and the porno star. The mess ends with a sexual scene (not pornographic) that many people feel shocked about, but I believe it is less provocative than you can see in American Pie or History of Violence. The two main characters never talk. Sometimes, a musical number 60 style appears and explains (through a song) what is happening in characters minds. These video clips, are really welcomed because the previous scene, without dialog or music only people looking at each other, takes sometimes 4, 5 or even more minutes which in movie times is TOO MUCH. There is also a few bits about \\"the difficult to make sex without love\\", the \\"selfish mind of the porno industry\\". It is obvious, this movie intended (get away with it) to fool festival juries and critics. It have a few pseudo-shocking scenes (within the limits of Taiwan censorship) and many subjects are open, but nothing is concluded or goes anywhere. These tricks, got the movie a few (disputed) important prices in film festivals and get the movie an undeserved commercial success (I see the movie in France and the theater was packed). However, please, do not be fooled. There is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this movie. It is boring and empty; really a fraud to public.

Clayton Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Breath of Life\\" Genre: Sci-Fi/Drama/Adventure Plot: The year is 2071, and mankind has successfully established a thriving colony on Mars. Clayton, a brilliant and dedicated aerospace engineer, finds himself at the forefront of interplanetary travel. After years of hard work, he is chosen as one of the six astronauts that NASA will send on a deep-space mission to explore the existence of life on a distant exoplanet called Elysium-9. The intense training and preparation have forged a strong bond between the six astronauts, who come from different countries. Each one of them has their own unique personality and brings something valuable to the team. As the mission begins, they leave behind their families and Earth, embarking on a perilous journey—knowing that they won't return for at least a decade. Months into their mission, the spacecraft they are on, the BEACON, encounters an unexpected cosmic dust storm, causing significant damage to the onboard life support system, specifically the oxygen generator. The astronauts are faced with a dire situation—it quickly becomes apparent that there isn't enough oxygen left for the entire crew to survive until they complete their mission. Clayton, the engineering genius that he is, tackles the challenge head-on. With limited resources and time ticking away, he must either fix the oxygen generator or find an alternative solution to ensure that the mission can continue and all astronauts can survive. Amidst the pressure, the team's unity and trust are put to the extreme test, as some crew members begin to prioritize personal survival over the mission's success. As the crew approaches Elysium-9, they receive a faint signal from the exoplanet's surface, indicating possible life. Intrigued and spurred on by hope, Clayton works tirelessly, finally managing to create a makeshift oxygen-filtration system utilizing a unique bacterium native to Elysium-9. While this system doesn't provide enough oxygen for the entire crew, it gives Clayton the wrenching responsibility of deciding to whom the remaining oxygen should be given. Realizing the moral implications, Clayton must grapple with determining the value of one life over another, examining each crew member's potential contribution to the mission's success. The difficult decision weighs heavily on Clayton, further driving the crew apart as suspicions and arguments arise, threatening to dismantle the unity that has carried them so far. Ultimately, Clayton makes the tough decision, resulting in two crew members being placed in cryogenic stasis for the rest of the mission. The remaining crew members, inspired by Clayton's courage and selflessness, get to work analyzing the now-accessible resources on Elysium-9. They are successful in discovering a unique element that could revolutionize space travel and further their search for life elsewhere in the universe. In the end, Clayton's determination and passion for the mission not only lead to the astronauts' survival but offers a glimpse of an even brighter future for mankind—one where interstellar exploration and coexistence with other life forms is a reality. Like the breath of life, the valuable information they bring back to Mars and Earth becomes a turning point in human history. The choices Clayton had to make and sacrifices endured by the crew will always be remembered as a testament to the unlimited power of human ingenuity and compassion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west.

Possible answers: kind, unkind, considerate","completion":"To describe Skylar, I would take the following steps: Step 1: Analyze Skylar's actions and their impact Skylar bought a ticket but then decided to scalp it. Scalping is generally considered an unethical practice, as it often involves selling the ticket at a higher price than its face value.

Twelve new-style schools are open to act as a bridge to the workplace and cut the number of NEETs. Under plans, schools will operate longer days and work outside standard school terms. Each teenager will be expected to spend between four hours and two days a week on work placements with business related to the school and a personal coach will be sent to the teenagers to act as a school \\"line manager\\". The reforms are put forward because of the fears that too many teenagers are finishing full-time education at present but they are short of the skills needed to succeed in the workplace. According to a recent report, more than two thirds of employers believe school and college leavers have less important employability skills, while 55% say they are unable to manage their time or daily routine. And the number of NEETs who are not in education has hit a record high, with almost one-in-five young people being left without a job or a training place. The Department for Education will tell the public the building of 12 studio schools - providing for around 3,600 teenagers - in areas such as Liverpool, Stevenage, Stock-on-Trent and Fulham, west London. Each one will be connected to the local employers. Under plans, teenagers will be able to move out of ordinary schools to attend them between the ages of 14 and 19. The government said all subjects would be taught \\"through projects, often prepared with employers\\" - with rules such as science being connected directly to local engineering companies or hospitals. Schools will operate a longer day to give teenagers a better understanding of the needs of the workplace. Along with their studies, students will carry out work placements for four hours a week, rising to two days a week of paid work for those aged 16 to 19. They will also get the chance to take professional qualifications connected directly to the needs of local employers. Options: A The worry about educated teenagers short of working skills.

Although the design of the dome was working perfectly as per the user's statement, there were a few significant drawbacks that led to the negative experience. Firstly, the plastic hooks that came with the product failed to support the weight of the user's bird feeder. This resulted in the feeder crashing to the ground, causing damage to an expensive item valued at 100. Such an unfortunate event could have been avoided if the hooks were made of stronger material or if the user had known the limitations of the product beforehand. Moreover, the user has observed other domes available in the market that feature metal hooks, which could potentially be a better and more reliable alternative for hanging bird feeders. This indicates that the user is leaning towards recommending those alternative products with metal hooks over the current product in question. In conclusion, considering the user's experience and the issues highlighted in the review, it is evident that the user would not recommend this particular product to others. The failure in terms of durability and structural integrity has led to the destruction of an expensive bird feeder, and the user advises potential buyers to explore alternative options with metal hooks for better performance and reliability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health.

A North Korean soldier looks south from the North side at the truce village of Panmunjom, South Korea, July 22, 2015. SEOUL North Korea has erected a new, taller launch tower at its missile base, possibly in preparation for firing a long-range rocket to mark an important national anniversary in October, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday. The 67-metre (220-ft) tower will be able to accommodate the launch of a longer-range missile than the rocket test-fired in December 2012. That launch was widely considered successful in putting an object into space orbit, the Yonhap report said. North Korea is banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions from conducting tests that use ballistic missile technology but has defied international warnings and sanctions to pursue missile and nuclear programs. \\"Our assessment is that the North will use the newly upgraded Tongchang-ri (missile) launch pad to launch a long-range missile larger than Unha-3,\\" Yonhap quoted a South Korean government source as saying. Unha-3 refers to the long-range rocket fired in 2012 from the base near its west coast. The launch is likely to come around the 70th anniversary of the founding of the North's ruling Workers' Party on Oct. 10, the source was quoted as saying. South Korea's Defense Ministry could not immediately confirm the report but an official said they were seeking to verify it. North Korea is believed to be developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) but is seen as years away from deployment. It is also working to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to mount on a delivery vehicle. (Reporting by Jack Kim; Editing by Paul Tait) ||||| SEOUL, July 22 (UPI) -- North Korea has built an extension to a rocket-launching platform near the China border in what Seoul said is preparation for a rocket launch ahead of a major anniversary. Construction began in late 2013 on a preexisting 50-meter launch pad at Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri, North Pyongan Province, and the work of adding 17 meters to the site is near completion, an unidentified Seoul official told Yonhap on Wednesday. The purpose of the extension is to launch missiles twice the size of the Unha-3, according to South Korean news outlet Daily NK. The Unha-3 is an expandable carrier rocket that was launched in 2012 and fell into the Yellow Sea. The debris of a second stage launch fell into the Philippine Sea after an object had entered orbit. Another Seoul government source said intelligence indicated North Korea was producing long-distance rockets in a Pyongyang munitions factory and that South Korea had credible information Kim Jong Un had ordered the launch of a \\"satellite\\" to mark the 70th anniversary of the Workers' Party of North Korea. Activities at Pyongyang Mirim Airport showed preparations for a large-scale military inspection by Kim Jong Un. Scud missiles, 240-mm rocket launchers, artillery, armored vehicles and transportation equipment had been assembled. South Korea expects any launch around the Oct. 10 anniversary would be used as a provocation against Seoul. \\"We are closely watching the construction in Tongchang-ri,\\" South Korean Defense Minister Kim Min-seok told Yonhap. North Korea insists the site, which has audio, video and data connections to Pyongyang's control centers is for a \\"peaceful satellite launch.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"North Korea has reportedly erected a new, taller launch tower at its missile base, in what South Korea's Yonhap news agency suggests could be preparation for firing a long-range rocket to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the country's ruling Workers' Party on October 10th. The 67-meter tower will apparently be able to accommodate the launch of a longer-range missile than the one fired in 2012, which was widely regarded as a successful test. Although North Korea is banned by the U.N. Security Council from conducting tests of this kind, it has continued to develop its missile and nuclear programs in spite of sanctions and warnings from the international community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation 18*q - 545 = 60*q - 41 for q, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable 'q' on one side of the equation by moving all terms involving 'q' to one side and all constants to the other side. First, we can subtract 18*q from both sides of the equation to move all the 'q' terms to the right: -545 = 42*q - 41 (since 60*q - 18*q = 42*q) Step 2: Isolate 'q' by moving the constant from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do this, we can add 41 to both sides of the equation: -545 + 41 = 42*q -504 = 42*q Step 3: Solve for 'q' by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'q', which is 42 in this case: -504 / 42 = q q = -12 So, the value of q is -12."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Who had more troops in Iraq in 2003, the United States, or the Kurdish militia?\\" Context: \\"After the lengthy Iraq disarmament crisis culminated with an American demand that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein leave Iraq, which was refused, a coalition led by the United States and the United Kingdom fought the Iraqi army in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere - The Earth's temperature rises - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more greenhouse gas is made happens, how will it affect cleaner air quality. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided suggests that more greenhouse gas production will occur, and we will examine how this might affect cleaner air quality and if there are any direct or indirect effects on the overall process. 1. Impact on cleaner air quality: Increased production of greenhouse gases will have a negative impact on cleaner air quality. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), contribute to air pollution and can exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular health problems among the population. Higher concentrations of CO2 in particular, emitted mainly from fossil fuel combustion in power plants, vehicles, and industrial processes, will lead to increased smog, acid rain, and ground-level ozone, all of which reduce air quality. 2. Direct effects on the process: As human activities add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, the process of heat radiation being trapped in our atmosphere increases. This leads to a rise in the Earth's temperature, known as global warming or climate change. Higher greenhouse gas concentrations directly influence the energy balance within Earth's atmosphere by absorbing and reradiating more thermal energy, affecting heat exchange between Earth's surface and the atmosphere, and potentially intensifying weather-related events such as storms, floods, and droughts. 3. Indirect effects on the process: The increase in greenhouse gas emissions can also have several indirect effects on the process. For example, higher temperatures due to global warming may lead to: - Melting polar ice caps, causing sea levels to rise and increasing the risk of coastal flooding. - Changes in ecosystems, affecting species distribution and potentially causing extinctions. - Disruptions in agriculture and food supply, as changing climate patterns affect crop production and availability of freshwater resources. - Increasing prevalence of vectors (e.g., mosquitoes) that transmit diseases, thereby impacting human health. In conclusion, increased production of greenhouse gases will have a negative impact on cleaner air quality and will both directly and indirectly affect the process of solar radiation absorption, heat radiation, and temperature regulation on Earth. It is crucial to implement strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to protect air quality and prevent further consequences related to climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Dial M for Murder Context: Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is a former tennis player who married Margot (Grace Kelly) partly for her money. To please his wife, he has given up tennis and now sells sports equipment. Margot once had a relationship with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), an American crime scriptwriter, but broke it off when he went back to the U.S. for a year.In time they stopped writing to each other, and when Mark returns to London she tells him that she burned all his letters but one. Margo explains to Mark that the letter was stolen by a blackmailer who demanded £50, so Margot payed by mailing the money to a pawn shop location as intended, but the money was never picked up and the letter was never returned. Mark tells Margo that he wants to tell Tony about them so she can divorce Tony so she and Mark can be together, but Margot refuses out of fear of hurting Tony's feelings.It is also revealed that Tony and Margot have made their wills, naming each other as beneficiary with assets and money totaling £90,000. For a year, Tony meticulously plans Margot's murder. She has no idea that Tony knows of her love for Mark. He has gone to great lengths to steal a handbag containing one of Mark's letters, and even assumed the role of the anonymous Brixton-based blackmailer to find out whether she would pay to have it back. (She did, but he asked for only £50 and she did not, of course, get the letter back.) He even watched them having a little farewell party, eating spaghetti with mushrooms in Mark's studio flat in Chelsea.Tony slyly withdraws small amounts of money for a year, collecting £1,000 in (used) one-pound (£1) notes, with which he plans to pay a contract killer. He singles out the perfect man to do the job: Charles Alexander \\"C.A.\\" Swann (Anthony Dawson), who now calls himself \\"Captain Lesgate\\", a former acquaintance who has embarked on a life of petty crime since even before leaving Cambridge where he and Tony were both students.

Summarize this article: When the inquiry finally emerged in its full two million words, in the chaotic aftermath of the EU referendum, its analysis was polite. But it was firmly critical of the decision-making process and behaviour of the UK government both in the run-up to, conduct of, and aftermath of one of the most controversial conflicts in British foreign policy - what many now regard as one of the UK's biggest foreign policy mistakes. In the immediate aftermath of the inquiry itself, Sir John, a former Whitehall permanent secretary who had worked for decades at the highest level of government, declined to take further part in the debate, as his and his panels' conclusions were digested. But in the run-up to the report's anniversary, he agreed to speak for the first time about the inquiry's conclusions, its criticisms and consequences for us all. Exactly a year ago, he produced two million words in 12 volumes, to detail a seven-year long study of the tumultuous political and diplomatic events in the run-up to, conduct, and aftermath of the 2003 Iraq War. But what was implicit in the lengthy pages of that document is now crystal clear in his personal, succinct and unvarnished view of the hours of evidence, thousands of documents, and witness accounts of one of the country's most significant public inquiries. He defends its duration, its conduct, and believes strongly that the work could stop another rush to war in the future. Sir John told me believes the \\"rising generations\\" of the military have understood and absorbed the lessons of the inquiry so much that they would demand and insist that future governments would be required to be more rigorous, more thorough in their examinations of the case for war. He explained his exhaustive criticism of the relationship between Tony Blair and George W Bush, his shock on seeing their private correspondence for the first time. He also spoke of his own relief at how the families of those killed in the conflict received his report when it was finally published. But he speaks plainly on perhaps the most fundamental political question of all, the role of the former prime minister. When asked if Tony Blair had been as straight with the country and the inquiry as he ought to have been, Sir John told me, 'any prime minister taking a country into war has got to be straight with the nation and carry it, so far as possible, with him or her. I don't believe that was the case in the Iraq instance.\\" He went on to say he believed Tony Blair had given an \\"emotional truth\\" to the inquiry, and had been \\"suffering\\" during its sessions - Tony Blair was always, he said ,\\"the advocate\\" for whom, \\"persuasion is everything\\". A spokesperson for the former prime minister referred us to his comments when the inquiry was published, when he said the report showed there were no lies, and no deceit, but that he took responsibility for the criticisms of how decisions had been made. You won't be surprised, having undertaken such a huge task, that Sir John speaks on a massive range of issues concerned with the Iraq war. The conflict may have begun 14 years ago now, the inquiry taking longer than the war itself. But for our politics, our diplomacy, and our military, this new more personal account will still resonate today. Summary:","completion":"Sir John Chilcot, who led the seven-year inquiry into the British government's conduct in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War, believes that future generations of military leaders would insist that governments are more thorough and rigorous in their examinations before going to war.

Question: \\"What tiny section of the organ in a person's head that is concerned with sentimental experiences is located just below the thalamus?\\" Context: \\"Emotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us. Pioneering work by Broca (1878), Papez (1937), and MacLean (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures.

Please answer the following question: As many of you will have seen, unfortunately the Ubuntu Edge campaign did not reach our goal of 32million. The final total reached was 12,812,776. I am hugely proud and thankful to everyone who pledged, supported the campaign, wrote about it, and helped to spread the word. Some have described us not meeting the goal as a “failure”. I don’t see it that way. Let’s be honest: 32million was always an incredibly ambitious target. We would have liked to have done it for less money, but building a F1 superphone doesn’t come cheap (and remember that the 32million didn’t include any costs for software engineering and project management…Canonical were providing that for free). It was an ambitious target, but disrupting an industry is ambitious in itself, and we gave the crowd-funding campaign our best shot. The story does not end here though. I am not surprised that we didn’t hit this ambitious 32million target, but I am surprised at what we did achieve. We broke all the crowd-funding records, garnered media attention across CNBC, Engadget, The Independent, TechCrunch, the BBC, T3, Stuff, The Verge, The Guardian, Wired, pandodaily, Fast Company, Forbes, The Telegraph and more.

The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin. Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London.

Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, HanshirÅ's closest friend performed seppuku and left a letter assigning to HanshirÅ the guardianship of his teenage sonâMotome. Despite HanshirÅ's pleas, his Lord forbade him to kill himself. In order to... A:","completion":"No answer"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Space your eyelets/grommets roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart along both sides of the back of your corset, near the edge. As you reach the waist, space four pairs of eyelets more closely together by about 1/4 inch (1/2 cm). You can buy these at a local craft or sewing store. Grommets are the holes in the back of your corset in which you lace up your corset. Use a fabric punch, leather punch, or awl to punch the holes out for your eyelets. Hammer the eyelets in place from both sides with a rubber hammer. Start at the top and lace the corset down to the waist using a crisscross pattern. Work from the bottom up in the same manner, again stopping at the waist. Tie your laces together at the waist in \\"bunny ear\\" or \\"tennis shoe\\" style. You need about 5 yards (5 m) (4.5 m) of lacing total. Ribbon and twill are the most historically accurate forms of lacing, but flat lacing and cable cord hold up better in the long-term.

Question: Information: - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole. - Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868 December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for the measurement of the elementary electronic charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect. - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown. - George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868 February 21, 1938) was an American solar astronomer, best known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots, and as the leader or key figure in the planning or construction of several world-leading telescopes; namely, the 40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, 60-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, 100-inch Hooker reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson, and the 200-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory. - The Association of American Universities (AAU) is an international organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada. - Amos Gager Throop (; 18111894) was a businessman and politician in Chicago, Illinois during the 1840s and 1850s. Most famously he was known for being a staunch abolitionist prior to the Civil War. In Chicago he lost two campaigns to be that city's mayor in 1852 and 1854. In both elections he was the nominee of the little-known Temperance Party, facing tough opposition from the Democratic Party. At the time of the Great Chicago Fire Amos was the city treasurer. He was instrumental in securing financing from New York to rebuild the wooden frontier town into a city of brick and mortar. Grateful Chicagoans renamed Main Street to Throop Street. Many years later and after moving to California, he was finally elected mayorof Pasadena, California in 1888. - Wallace Leslie William Sargent FRS ( February 15 , 1935 -- October 29 , 2012 ) was a British - born American astronomer and the Ira S. Bowen Professor of Astronomy at California Institute of Technology . - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better. - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures. - A vocational school, sometimes called a trade school or vocational college, is a post-secondary educational institution designed to provide vocational education, or technical skills required to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. Vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s \\"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\\" as well as technical skills of their students. Australia. Vocational schools were called \\"technical colleges\\" in Australia, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET). Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as \\"trade colleges\\". At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Australian Industry Trade College and one in Adelaide, Vergalargona rico, Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College. - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Pasadena is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of 2013, the estimated population of Pasadena was 139,731, making it the 183rd-largest city in the United States. Pasadena is the ninth-largest city in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, becoming only the second city to be incorporated in what is now Los Angeles County, after Los Angeles (April 4, 1850). It is one of the primary cultural centers of the San Gabriel Valley. - Arthur Amos Noyes (September 13, 1866 June 3, 1936) was a U.S. chemist, inventor and educator. He received a PhD. in 1890 at Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The California Institute of Technology (abbreviated Caltech) is a private doctorate-granting university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.

A: Afterwards Caesar turned his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain) but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: Julius Caesar's armies crossed the river Rubicon in 49 BC, marking the beginning of a civil war between Caesar and Pompey, who was representing the Roman Senate. This event is very significant in Roman history, as crossing the Rubicon signaled Caesar's defiance towards the Senate and his intentions to forcefully gain power within the Roman Republic. Leading up to these events, Caesar had been consolidating power through his conquests in Gaul (modern-day France and Belgium). As his term as the Governor of Gaul was ending, the Senate instructed Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome without any armed forces. By crossing the Rubicon, Caesar was committing a provocative act of war, since Roman generals were not allowed to bring their armies from their provinces to Rome. Knowing that he had many supporters in Rome, Caesar proceeded with his plan and crossed the river Rubicon with his legions. This led to a civil war that lasted from 49 to 45 BC, ultimately culminating in Caesar's victory and the collapse of the Roman Republic. After crossing the Rubicon, Caesar went on to campaign against various opponents, including his rival Pompey who fled to Greece. Caesar pursued Pompey and defeated him in the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC. Pompey was later assassinated in Egypt, leaving Caesar as the unchallenged leader of the Roman world. Caesar continued his campaigns, eventually defeating the remaining Pompeian forces in Spain and North Africa, which solidified his power and sparked the transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire. In summary, Julius Caesar's armies crossed the river Rubicon in 49 BC, a decisive event that initiated the Roman Civil War and ultimately led to Caesar's rise as the supreme ruler of Rome, replacing the Roman Republic with the Roman Empire."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

He, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Calamity Jane, are the central characters. As the Civil War closes, Lincoln mentions his concern that the country's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice, \\"Go West, young man,\\" which, mercifully, the film didn't erroneously attribute to Horace Greeley, as a number of others did. But then, he gets assassinated, and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the American Indians. In the meantime, we see Wild Bill Hickock, who interacts with a small boy, while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the Mississippi. Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife, which he eventually gives to the boy, calling it an \\"Arkansas Toothpick,\\" which in reality was a different type of knife, though both were used throughout the frontier. Hickock eventually meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man. Cody has just gotten married, and is bringing his bride to the Old West to settle down. When they arrive at their destination, they run into Calamity Jane, who has a crush on Hickock. She looks at Cody's wife, and asks Buffalo Bill, \\"Is this your mopsy?\\" The line was one that caused the Hayes Board some problem, since one definition of \\"mopsy\\" was prostitute. Demille wanted the line in, and one of his aides pointed out that in Beatrix Potter's books about Peter Rabbit, three of the rabbits were Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail. He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify \\"the rabbit of ill virtue.\\" It worked; the line stayed in. The Indians were getting restless, in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the Eastern financiers. Cody and Hickock were asked to help scout the area, so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area. Cody led the troops; Hickock went to check out the activities of an Indian chief, who was an old acquaintance, and who was leading some of the hostile Indians. Calamity Jane gets captured, and Hickock gets captured trying to save her. They are brought to the chief, and although neither would talk, torture applied to Hickock breaks Calamity Jane's willpower, and she tells the route Cody is using. The two are released, and Hickock joins up with Cody and his forces, in part to alert them they're walking into a trap. With Hickok's help, they hold off the Indian attack. Hickock decides to go after the gun runners, and finally takes them prisoner. As they're waiting for authorities, Hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards.

Article: After the Union of Horodło the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with the Polish szlachta, and over time began to become more and more polonized, although they did preserve their national consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were of Roman extraction, and the Lithuanian language was just a morphed Latin language. This led to paradox: Polish nobility claimed own ancestry from Sarmatian tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies to Romans. Thus new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led that in the 16th century the new term to name Lithuanian nobility appeared šlėkta—a direct loanword from Polish szlachta. From the view of historical truth Lithuanians also should use this term, šlėkta (szlachta), to name own nobility, but Lithuanian linguists forbade the usage of this Polish loanword.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: World leaders from nearly 200 countries have signed an important historic agreement to fight global climate change. The agreement came after two weeks of talks between the leaders at the 21st Conference in Paris, France. As part of the Paris agreement, countries said they would cut down on pollution However, according to the terms of the deal, countries that don't do this will not be punished, or fined. Instead,the document is meant to show that governments around the world take climate change seriously and are willing to work together to fight global warming. World leaders have met many times to discuss climate change. But, the 21st Conference of Parties, or COP21, which began on November 30 in Paris, was the first time they agreed on a global, legal pact . Before the conference, each nation was asked to create plans on how to reach the shared goal. The pact that was signed allows countries to decide the best way to cut down their gas pollution. No matter how they decide to go green, each country must report honestly on all of their efforts. Every five years, nations must look at the work they've done and submit new plans on how they will improve over the next five years. In the pact, the countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the levels that trees,soil and oceans can absorb naturally. It urges countries to spend trillions of dollars on creating new energy sources, like solar and wind power. It also requires countries to raise at least 100 billion each year to help developing countries. However, critics of the pact say it is not detailed enough, and doesn't include specifics about how the plan will be enforced and how improvements will be measured. The pact does include one large, specific goal: how countries will aim to keep global temperatures from rising more than 3. 60degF(20degC) by 2100. Nonetheless,the agreement is considered by many world leaders to be a major victory. The U. N. has been working more than two decades to convince governments to work... Answer:","completion":"Which of the following statements is true about the Paris Agreement, signed by world leaders at the 21st Conference in Paris, France? A. Countries that do not cut down on pollution will be punished with fines. B. Each nation must follow a predetermined method to cut down gas pollution. C. The agreement aims to keep global temperatures from rising more than 3.6°F (2°C) by 2100. D. The pact does not require countries to submit new plans for improvement over time. Answer: C.

The root \\"volat\\" means \\"to call,\\" and the prefix \\"do-\\" strengthens the meaning, making it \\"to successfully call\\" or \\"to reach.\\" The second translation, \\"Snažil jsem se tě dovolat,\\" conveys a similar meaning but with a slight difference in tense: 1. \\"Snažil jsem se\\" means \\"I was trying\\" or \\"I tried.\\" The verb \\"snažit se\\" here is in the past tense, 1st person singular form (reflecting \\"I\\" as the subject), and the past participle \\"snažil\\" matches the gender of the speaker – masculine in this case; for a female speaker, it would be \\"snažila jsem se.\\" 2. \\"tě\\" and \\"dovolat\\" remain the same as in the first translation. Both translations are correct, and the choice depends on whether you want to convey the ongoing effort of trying to reach someone (present tense: \\"Snažím se tě dovolat\\") or the action that occurred in the past (past tense: \\"Snažil jsem se tě dovolat\\")."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The exchanges were ferocious, mainly attacking the media, whose dishonesty, he said, was out of control. It included the moment when he told an African-American journalist to set up a meeting between him and a group of black lawmakers, suggesting that they knew each other. It started when April Ryan asked the president about including the Congressional Black Caucus in discussions about issues related to the African-American community. Ms Ryan, who is White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks, first used the group's acronym CBC, but Mr Trump apparently did not recognise it. Then he asked her: \\"Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours?\\" \\"No, no, I'm just a reporter\\", she answered. The exchange came minutes after Mr Trump said he was the \\"least racist person\\". The CBC expressed dismay at Mr Trump's comments. Democratic Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina says they contained \\"an element of disrespect\\", according to the Associated Press. Some of the group's members shared their reactions on social media, along with President Obama's national security adviser and former US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice. Mr Trump finished his answer by accusing Democratic representative Elijah Cummings, a senior member of the caucus, of being told not to meet with him. But CBC said on Twitter it had sent a letter to Mr Trump before his inauguration, but that it had never got a response. After the news conference, Ms Ryan gave TV interviews in which she said she did not feel insulted by the president's remarks - and that she was \\"old school\\" and not supposed to be in the news. Later, she came back to Twitter to announce that a meeting between Mr Trump and the CBC might take place, although no date had been set. But by then, Mr Trump's comments had created a wave of responses from social media users. This was not the only awkward moment of the press conference. Mr Trump had a long exchange with Jim Acosta from CNN, which he again described as \\"fake news\\", called the BBC \\"another beauty\\", and told reporter Jake Turx, from Jewish publication Ami Magazine, to sit down after he asked a question about anti-Semitism. In that exchange, which came before Ms Ryan asked her question, Mr Trump said: \\"Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person.\\" He then interrupted Mr Turx - \\"Quiet, quiet, quiet\\" - and accused his opponents of some of the anti-Semitic acts.

Wolf island displayed lots of evidence for natural selection, and had a large variety of species inhabiting it. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits? Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common.

Context: After the four failed expeditions on Junkceylon, Bodawpaya gave up on wars with Siam, and now looked to the small states to the west. The first target was Manipur, which had regained independence from Burma since 1782. In February 1814, he sent an expedition force to place his nominee Marjit Singh to the Manipuri throne. The Manipuri army was defeated after heavy fighting, and its raja Chourjit Singh fled into Cachar. However, Marjit Singh revolted after Bodawpaya died in June 1819. The new king Bagyidaw sent an expedition force of 25,000 in October 1819. Gen. Maha Bandula reconquered Manipur but the raja escaped to neighbouring Cachar. In November 1820, the fallen raja's forces laid siege to the Burmese garrison at Imphal, and withdrew only when Burmese reinforcements were approaching. Nonetheless, the raja continued to raid Manipur with British support using his bases from Cachar and Jaintia, which had been declared as British protectorates, to the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824.

After Marjit Singh's revolt against the Burmese in 1819 and the reconquering of Manipur by General Maha Bandula, Chourjit Singh continued his efforts to reclaim the Manipuri throne with the backing of the British. By providing support and offering territories such as Cachar and Jaintia as bases for Raja Chourjit Singh's military operations, the British sought to counterbalance the influence and power of the Burmese Empire in the region. This collaboration and the ongoing conflicts between the Burmese and the British-backed forces eventually contributed to the outbreak of the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Movie title: Porky's Context: A group of Florida high school students plan on losing their virginity. They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole, but gets it smeared with soap.

The first question asks about the differences between C++ and C++11, while the second question asks about the differences between C++11 and Visual C++11. Let's address the differences between the various versions of C++: 1. The Difference between C++ and C++11: C++11 is an updated version of the C++ programming language introduced in 2011. It offers several new features, improvements, and modifications compared to the prior version of C++. Some of the notable changes introduced in C++11 are: A. Language Features: a. auto keyword: Allows the compiler to deduce the type of a variable, making the code more concise and easier to read. b. decltype: A feature that deduces the type of an expression. c. nullptr: A new keyword representing a null pointer constant, making code safer and more expressive. d. strongly typed enums: Improved enumeration type to provide better type-safety. e. static_assert: Compile-time assertions to check for programming errors and inconsistencies early. f. Range-based for loop: A new type of loop, making iterating over containers more convenient and readable. g. rvalue references and move semantics: Enable more efficient usage of resources, especially when working with temporaries. h. variadic templates: Allows the creation of templates that take a variable number of arguments, making it easier to write generic code. i. lambda expressions: Anonymous functions that can be defined within the code, improving flexibility and expressiveness of the language. B. Library Features: a. Standardized multithreading support: A set of libraries to ensure that C++ code is portable across different platforms and environments. b. Smart pointers: Added to cope with resource management and memory leaks more effectively, including unique_ptr, shared_ptr, and weak_ptr. c. Regular expressions: Standard library support for working with regular expressions to parse and manipulate text. d. new container classes: Forward list, unordered_map, unordered_set, etc., to address various programming use-cases. e. Tuple: A new library type that allows grouping of heterogeneous elements into a single object. f. Improved algorithms and random number generation support. 2. The Difference between C++11 and Visual C++11: The phrase \\"Visual C++11\\" could have two different interpretations: a. Visual C++ version 11: Referring to Microsoft's Visual Studio 2012 IDE, which supports the C++11 standard and offers additional features specific to the Microsoft ecosystem. b. Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler: A compiler that is part of Visual Studio and supports the C++11 standard. The focus is on the compiler rather than the IDE. The essential difference in the second question is about the features that a specific implementation of the C++11 standard (e.g., the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler) may or may not fully support, as well as additional tooling and library features unique to the Microsoft ecosystem. In conclusion, the first question asks about differences between two language standards (C++ and C++11), while the second question is about the differences between a language standard (C++11) and a specific development tool (Visual C++11) that implements that standard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Abstract: Following cell surface receptor activation, the alpha subunit of the Gq subclass of GTP-binding proteins activates the phosphoinositide signalling pathway. Here we examined the expression and localization of Gq protein alpha subunits in the adult mouse brain by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Of the four members of the Gq protein alpha subunits, Galphaq and Galpha11 were transcribed predominantly in the brain. The highest transcriptional level of Galphaq was observed in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and hippocampal pyramidal cells, while that of Galpha11 was noted in hippocampal pyramidal cells. Antibody against the C-terminal peptide common to Galphaq and Galpha11 strongly labelled the cerebellar molecular layer and hippocampal neuropil layers. In these regions, immunogold preferentially labelled the cytoplasmic face of postsynaptic cell membrane of PCs and pyramidal cells. Immunoparticles were distributed along the extra-junctional cell membrane of spines, dendrites and somata, but were almost excluded from the junctional membrane. By double immunofluorescence, Galphaq/Galpha11 was extensively colocalized with metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1alpha in dendritic spines of PCs and with mGluR5 in those of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Together with concentrated localization of mGluR1alpha and mGluR5 in a peri-junctional annulus on PC and pyramidal cell synapses (Baude et al. 1993, Neuron, 11, 771-787; Luján et al. 1996, Eur. J. Neurosci., 8, 1488-1500), the present molecular-anatomical findings suggest that peri-junctional stimulation of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors is mediated by Galphaq and/or Galpha11, leading to the activation of the intracellular effector, phospholipase Cbeta..

How's that for the start of a review? I'm not sure that I've ever had worse food at a restaurant, let alone one with such grand acclaims and high prices. Some reviewers say the decor is elegant, but it looks like the inside of an Irish bar to me. I believe that because of its location in Circus Circus there is an illusion of classiness created by juxtaposition. On the night that a friend and I went almost every item we ordered was awful. They were out of sauteed mushrooms, so we opted for crab legs and grilled shrimp. The shrimp were ok, but the crab legs were horrible. Too briny and salty, we couldn't even finish them, and the friend I was with is a fat bastard. The waiter ended up not charging us for those because he could tell our meal wasn't starting out well. Next we got our side salads, which were fine, but they weren't anything special. Besides, we were there for steak. My friend got the porterhouse and I got a ribeye. Mine was edible, whereas I had one bite of my friend's and could not have imagined eating much more than the single bite. Having learned our lesson, we didn't opt for dessert. I do recall getting decent service, but it doesn't matter when the meal is utterly unenjoyable. The bottom line: this is probably a great steakhouse much of the time, but when we were there it sucked ass big-time, and you shouldn't risk that, let alone have to pay for it.

Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Answer the above question based on the context below: Bradley \\"B-Rad\\" Gluckman is a 23 year old upperclass, privileged white man from Malibu, with aspirations of being \\"the biggest rapper that ever was\\". B-Rad dresses and speaks like a gangster and essentially talks and acts like he is black. His father, Bill Gluckman, is running for governor of California. After Bill's campaign manager Tom Gibbons gets irritated with B-Rad's constant interruptions with the election, Bill decides that B-Rad must see a psychiatrist, Dr. Feldman. B-Rad explains to Feldman that when he was a kid, his parents were hardly ever around so he got hooked on the music his black caretaker listened to, and dreamt of being a rapper ever since. Dr. Feldman tells B-Rad's parents Bill and Bess that B-Rad has the most serious case of \\"gangstaphrienia\\" that he has ever seen. Tom then has an idea to hire two actors, PJ and Sean James to try to scare B-Rad back to normal. Although Bill thinks it could get dangerous, he reluctantly agrees. With the help of PJ's cousin Shondra, they kidnap B-Rad and take him to the ghetto. Shondra tries to convince B-Rad that if he stops acting like a gangster, they will let him go.

The carpal tunnel within the wrist is a narrow passageway made from small carpal bones attached by ligaments. The tunnel protects nerves, blood vessels and tendons. The primary nerve that allows for movement and sensation in your hand is the median nerve. Thus, avoid activities that compress and irritate the median nerve, such as repeatedly flexing your wrists, lifting heavy weights, sleeping with bent wrists and punching solid objects. Make sure to keep your wrist watch and any bracelets loose around your wrists — having them too tight may irritate the median nerve. In most cases of CTS, a single cause is hard to identify. CTS is typically caused by a combination of factors, such as repetitive wrist strain combined with arthritis or diabetes. Wrist anatomy can make a difference — some people have naturally smaller tunnels or oddly shaped carpal bones. Stretching your wrists daily can be helpful for reducing or minimizing CTS symptoms. In particular, extending your wrists helps to make more space for the median nerve within the carpal tunnel because it stretches the surrounding ligaments. The best way to extend / stretch both wrists at the same time is making the \\"prayer pose.\\" Place your palms together about 6 inches in front of your chest and raise your elbows until you feel a stretch in both wrists. Hold it for 30 seconds and repeat 3-5x per day. Alternatively, grab the fingers of the affected hand and pull back until you feel a stretch in the front of your wrist. Wrist stretches may temporarily trigger more CTS symptoms, such as tingling in the hand, but don't stop them unless you actually feel pain. The symptoms will diminish with time. In addition to hand tingling, other symptoms commonly associated with CTS include: numbness, throbbing pain, muscle weakness and/or color changes (too pale or red). If you notice your hand(s) falling asleep or feel achy pain in your wrist / hand, a quick (albeit temporary) fix is to give your hands a good shake for between 10-15 seconds — sort of like you're trying to shake water off your hands in order to dry them. The shaking can help to promote blood circulation and nerve flow within the median nerve and temporarily get rid of symptoms. Depending on what your job is, you may have to resort to shaking your hands out many times throughout the day to keep CTS symptoms at bay. CTS symptoms most often occur (and begin) in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and part of the ring finger, which is why people who have the condition often drop things and feel clumsy. The little finger is the only part of the hand not affected by CTS because its not innervated by the median nerve. Wearing a semi-rigid wrist support, brace or splint during the day can help prevent CTS symptoms because they keep the wrist in a neutral position and prevent it from flexing. Splints or wrist braces should also be worn during potentially aggravating activities, such as typing on a keyboard, carrying groceries, driving and bowling. Wearing wrist supports during sleep can help relieve the occurrence of nighttime symptoms, particularly if you have a habit of tucking in your hands to your body. You may need to wear wrist supports for several weeks (day and night) to get significant relief from CTS symptoms. However, for some, supports only provide negligible benefit. Wearing wrist splints at night is a good idea if you're pregnant and have CTS because pregnancy tends to increase swelling in the hands (and feet). Wrist supports, splints and braces can be bought at most pharmacies and medical supply stores. Some sleeping postures can definitely aggravate the symptoms of CTS, which leads to reduced amount and quality of sleep. More specifically, sleeping with your fists clenched tightly and/or hands tucked into your body (flexed wrists) is the worst position for triggering CTS symptoms, although extending your arms above your head is not a good position either. Instead, sleep on your back (supine) or sides with your arms close to your body, and keep your hands open and wrists in a neutral position. This will promote normal blood circulation and nerve flow. As noted above, wearing wrist supports while sleeping is helpful for preventing aggravating positioning, but it may take some time to get used to. Don't sleep on your stomach (prone) with your wrists compressed under your pillow. People who have this habit often wake up with numbness and tingling in their hands. Most wrist supports are made of nylon and fasten with velcro, which can irritate your skin. Therefore, cover your support with a sock or thin cloth to reduce skin irritation. In addition to your sleep position, your CTS symptoms may also be caused or aggravated by a poorly designed work station. If your computer keyboard, mouse, desk or chair isn't properly positioned to accommodate your height and body proportions, it can put strain on your wrists, shoulders, neck and mid back. Thus, make sure your keyboard is positioned so your wrists are not constantly extended back while typing. Consider getting an ergonomic keyboard and mouse, which are designed to reduce stress on wrists and hands. Your employer might cover the costs for you. Put thin cushioned pads underneath your keyboard and mouse to reduce the impact on your hands and wrists. Have an occupational therapist review your work station and suggest ergonomic changes tailored to your body. People who work on computers and registers (such as cashiers) for a job are at much higher risk of CTS. The symptoms of CTS are often related to inflammation / swelling that develop in the wrist, which secondarily irritates the median nerve and nearby blood vessels. Thus, taking OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve), can be very helpful for reducing CTS symptoms, at least in the short term. Painkillers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol), can also be used to combat the achy pain of CTS, but they don't impact the inflammation / swelling. NSAIDs and analgesics should be considered short-term strategies for controlling pain. There isn't any evidence that these medications cure or improve CTS in the long run. Taking NSAIDs for too long (or too much at any time) significantly increases your risk of stomach irritation, ulcers and kidney failure. Always read the labels for dosage information. Taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too can cause liver damage.","completion":"This article discusses carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) prevention and management, emphasizing wrist stretches, wearing supportive wrist braces, maintaining proper sleep and workstation posture, and using over-the-counter pain relief for short-term symptom relief."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He needed to increase production and efficiency, so he started using herbicides. Danny was one of his farmer friends, he had a small acreage farm and he practiced permaculture, so no pesticides. Which farmer didn't perform any applications of herbicide as a preventive measure? Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.

News 4's Chris Gordon reports. (Published Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016) A Maryland nanny has been charged in the death of a baby girl after she was allegedly caught on surveillance camera forcefully feeding her two bottles, police said. Eight-month-old Enita Salubi of Glenarden died Monday afternoon after she was rushed to a hospital, Prince George's County Police said. Authorities said video camera footage shows the events that led to the little girl's death. The nanny, 66-year-old Oluremi Oyindasola, was asleep on a couch inside the house Monday when the baby, who was in a walker, began crying and woke the nanny, police said. Police said a video surveillance camera shows the nanny tried to feed the baby, but without success. Oyindasola then pulled the baby from her walker, removed the nipple from her bottle and forcefully fed her, police said. \\"She forcefully poured the two bottles of what looks to be milk down the baby's mouth, causing her to not be able to breathe, suffocating her, and eventually she died at the hospital,\\" said Col. Harry Bond of Prince George's County Police. Charging documents say tha nanny appeared \\"to pour a large amount of white liquid directly inside the [v]ictim's mouth.\\" The baby appeared to squirm and resist while being fed the first bottle, and then Oyindasola forced the contents of a second bottle into her mouth, the documents said. The baby became unresponsive, and Oyindasola called the baby's father, who dialed 911 as he raced home. Clifton Wanzer, a neighbor, said he saw the little girl's father carry her to an ambulance. She was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. More than one neighbor told News4 they'd been concerned about the baby for some time. \\"That baby just cried [and] cried,\\" said neighbor Walker. \\"Every time I came outside, I'd hear that baby cry.\\" Police said an autopsy revealed Salubi's cause of death was asphyxiation, and the manner of death was homicide. Oyindasola, of Glenarden, is in custody, police said Wednesday. She is charged with second-degree murder, first-degree child abuse resulting in death, and related charges.

Oluremi Oyindasola, 66, of Glenarden, Md., was arrested Tuesday and is charged with second-degree murder, first-degree child abuse resulting in death and other related charges after 8-month-old Enita Salubi died in her care, Prince George’s County police announced Wednesday. A home surveillance system recorded Oyindasola, a live-in nanny, napping on the couch of a Glenarden home when she was disturbed by the crying child, who came up to her in a toddler walker, according to police charging documents. Oyindasola tried to feed the child while she was still in the walker but was unsuccessful, police said. [Do you know who’s watching your children?] Oluremi Oyindasola is charged with second-degree murder, first-degree child abuse resulting in death and other related charges after 8-month-old Enita Salubi died in her care.

For 25 seconds, the child “appeared to squirm and aggressively resist as the defendant continued to force a large amount of liquid inside her mouth,” records state. After the first bottled was drained, Oyindasola then forced the child to consume the contents of a second bottle. During the feedings the baby “displayed difficulty breathing and signs of medical distress,” records state. After the second bottle, the child became unresponsive and at about 4:10 p.m. was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed white liquid inside the child’s lungs, police said. A medical examiner determined the baby died of asphyxiation and the child’s death was a homicide, police said.

Article: The prefix = st1 /USgovernment has announced plans to list polar bears as a threatened species because of concerns that the ice where they live is melting. But as the BBC's Owen Clegg reports, theUSplans are also important for other reasons. It's estimated that there are no more than twenty-five thousand polar bears living in the wild, and this number could go down by a large amount as the floating ice upon which the bears survive melt away. Now, without admitting the cause of this melt, the US Fish and Wildlife Services are reviewing the bear's living conditions. That action is being taken at all, and marks an important change for the Bush administration; for the first time, it may be forced to acknowledge a link between global warming and its effect on a species. Such a conclusion by an unwilling Bush administration could force far wider changes inWashington's policy towards the environment. This review only came about after a union of environmental groups brought a legal case against the government to take action. Environmentalists, like David Doniger, believe that by calling on the protections of the Endangered Species Act, theUSgovernment may finally be forced to cut back on its sending out greenhouse gases: \\"It is a very important thing today to have the Bush administration notice that global warming is threatening the existence of the polar bear. Now, it's up to the administration to do something to stop the global warming that's threatening the polar bear.\\" ( David Doniger) The United States is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases which are blamed for trapping heat from the sun and changing the earth's climate. Since taking office in 2001, President Bush has refused to make the link with global warming, but the bad, serious situation of the polar bear may force that position to change. Question: What is the significance of US Fish and Wildlife Services' reviewing the bear's living conditions? - It brought a legal case against the government. - It marks an important change for the Bush administration. - It is a conclusion by a Bush administration. - It makes the protections of the Endangered Species Act possible.

Rio +20, a major international environmental conference begins in Brazil on Wednesday, billed by its organizers as a \\"once in a lifetime\\" opportunity to safeguard our planet for generations to come. For three days from June 20, scores of world leaders and tens of thousands of people from all over the world will descend on Rio de Janeiro in the hope of reaching consensus on how to achieve this. Some critics have already dismissed the event as a hugely expensive talking shop that stands little more chance of succeeding than previous environmental summits. Others are more optimistic. Here we look at some of the key issues surrounding the conference. What is Rio + 20? Rio+20 is a summit that takes place from June 20 - 22, organized by the United Nations to tackle environmental issues. Its name signifies it is being held in Rio de Janeiro 20 years after a similar \\"Earth Summit\\" in the same city. The biggest U.N. conference in years, it is being billed as a major effort to improve mankind's relationship with the planet. See also: Five cities fight for climate survival. Who will be there? The 1992 event was attended by U.S. President George H.W. Bush but President Barack Obama is not expected to show at this year's event, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will head the U.S. delegation. British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the entire European Parliament have also declined to turn up. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Francois Hollande have confirmed they will be going. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will also be there, as will India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with China's Premier Wen Jiabao expected to attend. Also present will be representatives of so-called \\"stakeholder\\" groups deemed crucial for future environmental decision making. These include organizations speaking for children, indigenous peoples, workers, farmers and the business sector. A huge security operation will also be deployed to safeguard the summit. In all an estimated 50,000 representatives from 190 countries are expected, including around 120 heads of state and government. See also: Teenager gives world leaders her vision for the future. What will they talk about? The summit will essentially look at how to safeguard global economic growth without destroying the planet in the process. It also aims to ensure that any new environmental policies will transcend international borders. Within these goals, there are key areas of discussion, including food security, water and energy -- and a focus on developing countries. Drafting an agenda and getting everyone to agree to talk about it is has not been easy, however. Ahead of the summit there have been weeks of haggling between participants. With so many vested interests, organizers have struggled to whittle down hundreds of pages of recommendations and goals into a manageable document. Why is it important? The world's environment has continued to suffer since the 1992 summit. The World Wildlife Fund's recent Living Planet report said the ever-swelling global population is still consuming far more than can be replenished. The report said there was a widening and \\"potentially catastrophic\\" gap between the ecological footprints of rich and poor nations. Global consumption of natural resources, carbon emissions and poverty have all continued to increase. Although some contest such claims, scientific research points to a steady rise in world temperature which, if unchecked, is forecast to have catastrophic consequences for the planet. See also: Extinction threat 'a call to leaders' at Rio summit. What do organizers hope to achieve? It is hoped that the conference will lay the groundwork for a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs) that can be adopted worldwide. A text produced by negotiators, but still to be approved by world leaders at Rio, lists processes to establish \\"action-oriented\\" SDGs. If adopted the text would also strengthen the U.N. Environment Program and ultimately lead to better protection for the world's oceans. Will they succeed? Few expect hard and fast policies to be put in place after three days of discussion and the likelihood is that participants will sign up to a document committing themselves to further action in the future. What is open to question is how effective that document will be given the struggle to build consensus ahead of the conference. The absence of key players like Obama has cast a shadow, as has the relative failure of the 1997 \\"Kyoto Protocol\\" on limiting greenhouse gases, which was set in motion at the 1992 Rio summit. There are also numerous sticking points. Wealthy and poorer nations are likely to argue over sharing the burden of cutting carbon emissions. There have been concerns over the exclusion of references to basic human rights, such as access to water. Environmental monitoring methods are also expected to spark dissent. Pessimists say any agreement will be negated by the compromises needed to win universal approval. In a statement released by environmental group WWF on Tuesday, director general Jim Leape criticized revisions to the Rio +20 negotiating text made in recent days, calling it a \\"colossal failure of leadership and vision from diplomats.\\" He said the summit is \\"doomed to ridicule\\" unless world leaders \\"get serious about sustainable development.\\" But others, including UK Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman, have commended the commitment to SDGs outlined in the negotiating text.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

Read this article and answer this question The Navarrese Civil War of 1451-1455 pitted John II of the Kingdom of Navarre against his son and heir-apparent, Charles IV. When the war started, John II had been King of Navarre since 1425 through his first wife, Blanche I of Navarre, who had married him in 1420. By the marriage pact of 1419, John and Blanche's eldest son was to succeed to Navarre on Blanche's death. When Blanche died in 1441, John retained the government of her lands and dispossessed his own eldest son, Charles , who was made Prince of Viana in 1423. John tried to assuage his son with the lieutenancy of Navarre, but his son's French upbringing and French allies, the Beaumonteses, brought the two into conflict. John was supported by the Agramonteses. From 1451 to 1455, they were engaged in open warfare in Navarre. Charles was defeated at the Battle of Aybar in 1452, captured, and released; and John tried to disinherit him by illegally naming his daughter Eleanor, who was married to Gaston IV of Foix, his successor. In 1451, John's new wife, Juana Enríquez, gave birth to a son, Ferdinand. In 1452, Charles fled his father first to France, where vainly sought allies, and later to the court of his uncle, John's elder brother, Alfonso V at Naples. Charles was popular in Spain and John was increasingly unpopular as he refused to recognise Charles as his \\"first born\\", probably planning to make Ferdinand his heir.

It may seem hard to believe, but when electricity is made, so are greenhouse gases . This means that every time you use electricity you help make global warming worse! Cars are also making global warming worse. They burn fossil fuels in their engines, and send lots of greenhouse gases into the air. Global warming may be a big problem, but we can all help stop it. People can try to drive their cars less. Or even get ones that run on sunlight! You can also help. Let's try one of these top ideas: (1) Try to use less electricity. Turn off lights, your television, and your computer when you've stopped using them. To make electricity, fossil fuels are burned in big factories. But burning fossil fuels also makes greenhouse gases. You should also try to watch less TV. (2) Plant trees. Not only is it a fun thing to do, but it is also a great way to lower the number of greenhouse gases in the air. Trees take carbon dioxide out of the air when they grow. (3) Don't throw away your rubbish, try to recycle it. If rubbish is not recycled, it is put in the ground. There it rots and makes a greenhouse gas called methane .So try to recycle cans, bottles, plastic bags and newspapers. It'll make you feel great! And it'll help the Earth.

Again, it mostly affects the organs, such as the brain, skin, kidneys, and joints. The disease is also chronic, which means it lasts for the long-term. It causes the body to become inflamed as the immune system attacks healthy tissue. There is no cure for lupus; however, treatments can ease the symptoms. When people refer to lupus, they usually refer to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This type of lupus affects your skin and your organs, especially your kidneys, lungs, and heart. There are other types of lupus, including cutaneous lupus erythematosus and drug-induced lupus. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus only affects the skin and does not threaten the other organs of your body. It rarely develops into SLE. Drug-induced lupus can affect the skin and your interior organs, but it is induced by the use of specific medications. It usually goes away once those medications are out of the patient's system. The symptoms associated with this form of lupus are typically rather mild. Although it has been difficult for doctors to understand lupus, over time they have identified its characteristics. Lupus appears to be triggered by a combination of your genes and your environment. In other words, if you have a genetic predisposition for lupus, environmental factors can trigger it. Common lupus triggers include medications, infections, or contact with sunlight. Lupus might be triggered by sulfa drugs, drugs that make you more sensitive to sunlight, penicillin, or antibiotics. Physical conditions that can trigger lupus include infections, the common cold, a virus, being exhausted, getting an injury, or emotional duress. It is the ultraviolet rays from sun that can trigger lupus. Ultraviolet rays from fluorescent light bulbs can do the same thing.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. out of New Hampshire race due to concussion symptoms Hendrick Motorsports has announced that Dale Earnhardt Jr. will not race at the upcoming NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event at New Hampshire Motor Speedway due to concussion-like symptoms. Hendrick Motorsports released a statement saying Earnhardt was not cleared to race by physicians. “I wasn’t feeling great the week going into Kentucky [Speedway] and thought it was possibly severe allergies,” Earnhardt said in the statement. “I saw a family doctor and was given medication for allergies and a sinus infection. When that didn’t help, I decided to dig a little deeper. Because of my symptoms and my history with concussions, and after my recent wrecks at Michigan and Daytona, I reached out and met with a neurological specialist. After further evaluation, they felt it was best for me to sit out. “I’m disappointed about missing New Hampshire this weekend. I’m looking forward to treatment with the goal of getting back in the race car when the doctors say I’m ready.” [Dale Earnhardt Jr. plans to donate his brain for concussion research] Alex Bowman will be Hendrick Motorsports’ substitute driver in the No. 88 Chevrolet on Sunday. No timetable for Earnhardt’s return has been established. But on Friday, Hendrick Motorsports general manager Doug Duchardt said a decision regarding next weekend’s race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway would most likely be made by Wednesday. If Earnhardt remains out, Jeff Gordon will be driving the No. 88 at Brickyard. Yes. You read that right. “If Dale is not able to go at Indianapolis, we’ll put Jeff Gordon in the car,” Duchardt said during Friday morning’s press conference. Gordon is an equity owner in Hendrick Motorsports and retired after the 2015 season. But Earnhardt’s most likely going to be careful. This is his fourth documented time with a concussion or concussion-like symptoms. His first came in 2002. In 2012, he had two concussions in six weeks. “You can’t (ignore) concussions,” Earnhardt said in 2012. “It’s really dangerous doing that.” Earnhardt missed two races in the Chase back in fall 2012 with a concussion as well, after crashing at Talladega in a 25-car pileup in the last lap. “I’m proud of Dale for standing up,” said Rick Hendrick, owner of Hendrick Motorsports in a statement. “The number-one priority is his health, so we’re going to give him all the time he needs. We completely support the decision by the doctors and will be ready to go win races when he’s 100 percent. In the meantime, we have full confidence in Greg (Ives) and the team, and we know they’ll do a great job.” Earnhardt is currently sitting 13th in the Sprint Cup Series Standings with 461 points.

Given the question: Fungi lack chlorophyll, so they cannot make food by photosynthesis as plants can, and mushrooms are an example of fungi. Given these facts, what lacks chlorophyll among the following options: - mushrooms - alpacas - bacteria - acetic acid - Leptospirosis - salamanders - deserts - Conifers The answer is:","completion":"Mushrooms. Mushrooms are a type of fungi and so, just like other fungi, they lack chlorophyll. In biology, chlorophyll is a green photosynthetic pigment found in plants, algae, and some bacteria. It is an essential component for photosynthesis, the process through which plants and other organisms convert sunlight into chemical energy to fuel their activities. Fungi, including mushrooms, however, are not capable of photosynthesis due to the absence of chlorophyll in their cells. This is a key point of difference between fungi and plants, which possess chlorophyll. Instead of photosynthesis, mushrooms and other fungi get their nutrients from decaying organic matter in the environment, thus playing a key role in decomposition and nutrient recycling in ecologies. Looking at the other options, alpacas and salamanders are animals and don't have chlorophyll because they obtain their energy and nutrients through consuming plants or other animals. Bacteria is a broad classification of microorganisms, and while some bacteria do possess chlorophyll and can perform photosynthesis (like cyanobacteria), many types don't. Acetic acid is a type of organic compound used widely as a chemical reagent and is the main component of vinegar. It is not an organism and therefore does not possess chlorophyll. Similarly, Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterial pathogen; it is not an organism and does not have chlorophyll. Lastly, deserts and conifers involve a little bit more complexity. Deserts are a type of landscape and contain a variety of organisms including plants, animals, and microorganisms. The plants living in deserts, like cacti, do contain chlorophyll as they are capable of photosynthesis. Conifers are a group of gymnosperm plants commonly found in cooler parts of the world. They include trees like pines, firs, cedars, among others. These plants have chlorophyll in their needles (which function like leaves in other plants) which lets them perform photosynthesis, even in winter. So, based on the information provided, mushrooms are the entity that lacks chlorophyll among the options given."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: We will need to know the molar mass of the substance. This is like the weight of the molecule; it tells us how heavy it is. Step 3: Divide the molar mass of the substance by the molar mass of the empirical formula (like finding out how many mini-recipes make up the big recipe). Step 4: You will get a whole number (or close to a whole number) from step 3.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Spread the cooking oil across the whole surface of the skillet by tipping and rotating it. Keep the skillet over the heat until the oil starts to ripple. Non-stick pans will make your sear less crispy. Opt for a cast iron skillet. Make sure the meat isn’t dripping with marinade before you put it on the pan. Before the oil starts to smoke, lay the meat down in the center of the pan, or spread out smaller pieces of meat evenly so the meat isn’t crowded. Don’t move the meat around the pan once you’ve dropped it in. Use tongs or spatula to try and lift the meat off of the pan to check on the sear’s color. If the meat sticks to the pan, wait to flip it. Once you see a dark sear or the breading is golden brown, flip your meat over. The size and type of meat will affect the time it takes for it to cook. A 6 oz (170 g) chicken breast will take approximately 5 minutes for each side to cook through. A beef steak or pork tenderloin that’s 1 in (2.5 cm) thick will take 3-4 minutes on each side. If your meat isn’t at the right temperature and you’re afraid of the pan burning it, remove the meat from the skillet and place it on a baking pan. Put it into your oven on the broil setting for 2-3 minutes before checking the temperature again. Summary:","completion":"To effectively sear meat, use a cast iron skillet with cooking oil covering its surface, heat until oil ripples, place non-crowded, non-dripping meat in the center, flip only once a dark sear or golden browning appears, and adjust cooking times based on meat type and size."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What addition would raise the number of persons aboard a ship?\\" Context: \\"The Royal Navy is constructing two new larger STOVL aircraft carriers, the Queen Elizabeth class, to replace the three now retired Invincible-class carriers. The ships are HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. They will be able to operate up to 40 aircraft on peace time operations with a tailored group of up to 50, and will have a displacement of 70,600 tonnes. HMS Queen Elizabeth is projected to commission in 2017 followed by Prince of Wales in about 2020. The ships are due to become operational starting in 2020. Their primary aircraft complement will be made up of F-35B Lightning IIs, and their ship's company will number around 680 with the total complement rising to about 1600 when the air group is embarked. The two ships will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The addition that would raise the number of persons aboard a ship, specifically in the context of the Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, would primarily involve increasing the air group personnel count and the vessel's crew capacity, as well as accommodating support personnel and special mission teams. In the case of HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, there are several factors that can contribute to raising the number of persons aboard: 1. Expanding the air group: The primary aircraft complement of the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers consists of F-35B Lightning IIs. By increasing the number of aircraft deployed on the carriers, the Royal Navy can enhance their air projection capabilities, necessitating an increase in air group personnel. This includes pilots, ground crew, maintenance personnel, and aircraft handlers, among others. The text mentions that the tailored air group could consist of up to 50 aircraft, which would require additional personnel accordingly. 2. Augmenting the ship's company: The ship's company of the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers is expected to number around 680. To raise the number of persons aboard, the Royal Navy could consider adding more crew members to enhance operations, maintenance, safety, and overall efficiency. This could involve hiring additional skilled personnel such as engineers, navigators, communications officers, and medical staff, among others. 3. Support personnel and mission-specific teams: Depending on the specific mission and operational requirements, the Royal Navy may opt to increase the number of support personnel and specialized teams aboard the carriers. This could include members of the Royal Marine Commandos, special forces units, staff from intelligence and reconnaissance teams, and personnel from other branches of the UK military. By accommodating these specialized teams, the carriers can take on a broader range of missions, thus raising the overall number of persons on board. 4. Improving infrastructure and on-board facilities: To accommodate a larger number of personnel, the Royal Navy may need to make modifications to the infrastructure and facilities onboard the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers. This could involve redesigning living quarters, expanding mess halls and galleys, enhancing recreational spaces, and upgrading medical facilities. Additionally, adjustments may be necessary to optimize storage and workspace areas so that increased personnel and equipment can be efficiently managed. 5. Increased training and exercise opportunities: The Queen Elizabeth-class carriers may also raise the number of persons aboard by facilitating and participating in international training exercises and joint operations with allied nations. During these exercises, personnel from other participating nations may temporarily be embarked on the UK's carriers, which would contribute to a higher number of persons on board. These joint efforts foster collaboration and enable an exchange of knowledge and skills, ultimately enhancing the operational capabilities of all involved. In summary, the number of persons aboard a ship, specifically the Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, can be raised through the expansion of the air group, augmentation of the crew, accommodation of support personnel and special mission teams, improvements to on-board facilities and infrastructure, and participation in training and joint exercises."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: The Killing Movie plot: Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray). He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying. Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find to put the money in (and struggles to lock it properly). At the airport Johnny and Fay aren't allowed to take the suitcase along as hand luggage because of its size, and instead must check it in as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While waiting to board their plane they watch as the suitcase falls off a cart onto the runway, breaks open, and the loose banknotes are swept away by the backdraft from the plane's propellers. Fay and Johnny leave the airport but are unable to hail a cab before officers...

Field Marshal Henry William Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, (17 May 1768 - 29 April 1854), styled Lord Paget between 1784 and 1812 and known as the Earl of Uxbridge between 1812 and 1815, was a British Army officer and politician. After serving as a Member of Parliament for Carnarvon and then for Milborne Port, he took part in the Flanders Campaign and then commanded the cavalry for Sir John Moore's army in Spain during the Peninsular War; his cavalry showed distinct superiority over their French counterparts at the Battle of Sahagun, where his men captured two French lieutenant colonels and so mauled the French chasseurs that they ceased to exist as a viable regiment. He also commanded the cavalry at the Battle of Benavente, where he defeated the elite chasseurs of the French Imperial Guard. Paget's support of the proceedings against Queen Caroline, alleging her infidelity, made him for a time unpopular, and when he was on one occasion beset by a crowd, who compelled him to shout \\"The Queen!\\", he added the wish, \\"May all your wives be like her\\". At the coronation of George IV in July 1821, Paget acted as Lord High Steward of England. He was also given the additional honour of captain of Cowes Castle on 25 March 1826. In April 1827, he became a member of the Canningite Government, taking the post of Master-General of the Ordnance. Under the Wellington ministry, he accepted the appointment of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in February 1828. In December 1828, Paget addressed a letter to the Roman Catholic primate of Ireland stating his belief in the need for Catholic emancipation, which led to his recall by the government; on the formation of Earl Grey's administration in November 1830, he again became lord-lieutenant of Ireland. In this capacity he introduced state-aided education for 400,000 children. In July 1833, the ministry resigned over the Irish question. Paget spent the following thirteen years out of office, then joined Lord John Russell's administration as Master-General of the Ordnance in July 1846. He was promoted to field-marshal on 9 November 1846 and, having been appointed Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire on 31 January 1849, he finally retired from the Government in March 1852. Paget also served as honorary colonel of the 7th Light Dragoons and later of the Royal Horse Guards. He died of a stroke at Uxbridge House in Burlington Gardens on 29 April 1854 and was buried at Lichfield Cathedral, where a monument is erected to his honour. He was succeeded by his eldest son from his first marriage, Henry.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what did he do as the lieutenant?","completion":"As Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Field Marshal Henry William Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, introduced state-aided education for 400,000 children.

This oxygen is then bound to hemoglobin in their blood, which transports it to the tissues throughout their bodies. 2. Octopus: Octopuses have gills for respiration, and these gills are located inside their mantle cavities. Water is drawn into the mantle cavity, passing over the gills, where the octopus extracts the dissolved oxygen. Once the oxygen is bound to hemocyanin in their blood, it's transported to the body's cells. 3. Fish: Fish, in general, use gills to breathe, which is their primary respiratory organ. These gills are located on either side of the pharynx, and water flows over them, enabling the fish to extract oxygen from the water. This oxygen is then transported through the blood to supply cells and tissues throughout the body. 4. Lobsters: Lobsters also use gills to breathe. Their gills are located in the branchial chamber under their carapace. Water is circulated over the gills by the motion of the paddle-shaped structures called gill bailers. When oxygen is extracted from the water, it binds to hemocyanin in their blood, ensuring the oxygen's delivery to the lobster's body tissues. 5. Water bugs: Aquatic insects, such as water bugs, have specialized structures called gills for underwater respiration. These gills are not the same as those in fish but function similarly by extracting oxygen from the water. In some water bugs, the gills are internal and only extract oxygen through the tracheal system. 6. Trout: Trout is a type of fish, and like other fish, they use gills to extract oxygen from water. These gills are situated at the sides of their heads and serve as their primary respiratory organs. Water flows through the gill arches, allowing the trout to obtain oxygen for use in their bodies. In contrast, hippos and alligators do not use gills for respiration as they are non-aquatic mammals and reptiles respectively. Hippos have lungs and primarily breathe air but are known to stay submerged underwater for long periods. They can hold their breath for up to five minutes or more before needing to resurface for air. Alligators are primarily air-breathing reptiles, and despite being highly adapted to aquatic environments, they possess lungs to exchange gases and breathe air. Their nostrils are designed to close while submerged, and they are capable of remaining underwater for up to 2 hours in some instances, although they typically surface more frequently for oxygen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(b). volcanic activity.. (c). changing rates of erosion.. (d). evaporation of sea water..","completion":"To find the correct answer, let's analyze each option. (a). Changing environments: A variation in the environment may result in different conditions for the preservation of fossils. This could mean that one layer was deposited in an environment that favored the preservation of fossils, while the other layer did not. This is a possible explanation for the lack of fossils in one of the layers. (b). Volcanic activity: Although volcanic activity can sometimes cause the destruction of fossils (not creating the ideal environment for their preservation), sedimentary rocks are typically formed from the accumulation of sediments in water-based environments away from volcanic activity. Moreover, volcanic activity would more likely leave traces of volcanic deposits in the rock record rather than completely removing fossils. Therefore, this option is less likely to be the correct explanation. (c). Changing rates of erosion: Erosion involves the removal of sediments and rocks through processes such as water flow or wind. It wouldn't directly affect fossil formation, only the exposure of fossils on the hillside. Hence, this option isn't an appropriate explanation for the lack of fossils in one layer. (d). Evaporation of sea water: While the evaporation of sea water could cause changes in water chemistry and deposition of minerals, it doesn't directly affect the formation of fossils. Therefore, this option is less likely to be the right answer. Given the analysis, the most likely explanation for the lack of fossils in one layer of sedimentary rock is (a). changing environments, as it directly influences the conditions necessary for fossil formation and preservation."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Subscribe or Sign up for free access to six premium articles Subscribe Log in / Sign up Haaretz unlimited. Only 1 for the first month ||||| NEW YORK — In the closing years of the 16th century, as the Holy Inquisition reached across the ocean to Spanish and Portuguese territories, Luis de Carvajal the Younger was put on trial by the Mexican Inquisition, suspected of being a Jew. The Spanish-born de Carvajal (1567–1596) was from a family of “converso” Jews who had converted to Catholicism. He was living in Mexico, where his uncle served as the governor of Leon. Under torture, de Carvajal betrayed more than 120 people who continued to practice their faith in secret. He and many of his family were burned at the stake. Long a familiar name to scholars, de Carvajal kept a meticulously written diary, penned under the pseudonym Joseph Lumbroso. While there were some transcriptions, the original diary disappeared in 1939 from the National Archives of Mexico. Earlier this year, though, a keen-eyed collector spotted the de Carvajal diary at auction and helped orchestrate its return. Now, for the first time in more than 75 years, the newly recovered memoir — measuring only four inches by three inches — along with other de Carvajal religious manuscripts, are on view as part of “The First Jewish Americans: Freedom and Culture in the New World,” a stunning and eye-opening exhibit that runs through February 26, 2017, at the New-York Historical Society. The exhibit, which boasts more than 170 objects including rare early portraits, drawings, paintings, maps, books, documents and ritual objects, traces the arrival of Jews in the New World and sheds light on the ways in which Jews were influenced by and left an enduring mark on the emerging nation. A trio of de Carvajal’s handwritten books are believed to be the earliest extant Jewish manuscripts from the Americas. There’s a common misconception that American Jewish history is a story of the middle-to-late 19th and early-20th centuries, says Debra Schmidt Bach, the historical society’s curator of decorative arts. “But there’s a very rich history of American settlement and Jewish community in the Colonial period. They made very important inroads that paved the way,” for later generations, Bach told The Times of Israel. Much of the exhibit’s material is from the collection of Leonard L. Milberg, a 1953 alumnus of Princeton University. Today, Milberg’s alma mater houses a large portion of his collection. Last spring, the Princeton University Art Museum mounted a similar exhibit and published “By Dawn’s Early Light,” the essay-rich catalog with 75 full-color illustrations that accompanies the current show. By drawing on its own extensive collection along with other sources, the New York Historical Society presents a fascinating visual historical narrative for this little-known but influential period in the emergence of Jewish life in America. Milberg’s ‘amazing find’ It was just a few months before the exhibit opened in late October when Milberg, a learned and savvy New York City collector, noticed the de Carvajal items listed in a catalog from Swann Auction Galleries. “It was too good to be true. They must be either copies or forgeries,” he recalled thinking at the time. He headed over to the gallery to get an up-close look at the manuscripts. “I thought they were extraordinary,” he recalled in a phone conversation with The Times of Israel. The gallery removed the items from its auction and over the next few days and weeks scholars examined the manuscripts and authenticated them as the originals that had disappeared. Through diplomatic channels, Milberg arranged the repatriation of de Carvajal’s diary to the Mexican National Archives, which agreed to loan the manuscripts to the NYHS for the exhibit. Milberg’s recovery of the diary was remarkable, noted Bach. “It was an amazing find,” she said. The museum’s conservation department digitized the fragile documents and donated copies of the folio to the Mexican government, Princeton University and to Brown University. Jewish life from the Caribbean to New Amsterdam The first section of the exhibit opens with the world of Jewish life in the Caribbean colonies. Even as late as the mid-18th century, there were more Jews in Curacao, Suriname and Jamaica than in all of North America, according to accompanying wall texts. A 1718 map shows the Jewish settlement of Suriname, founded in 1667. A rabbinical letter from 1767 certifies as kosher a shipment of food from Philadelphia to Barbados. Several documents reveal the ways in which Jews found themselves on both sides of the issue of slavery, from Barbados to New York. In the section on North America, the exhibit focuses on Jewish colonial life in New York, Philadelphia and Charleston, home to the largest Jewish community in North America until the 1830s. Several items relate to New York’s Congregation Shearith Israel, the first Jewish congregation in colonial North America, including a large Torah scroll, one of two burned by British soldiers during the Revolutionary War, and a beautifully illustrated ketubah, a Jewish wedding contract. A delicately crafted set of silver Torah finials (1775-1776) were made for the synagogue by Myer Myers, one of the top silversmiths of colonial America, who served as the congregation’s president. The Levy-Franks family, among early New York’s most prominent Jewish families, is captured in a stunning series of six portraits by New York artist Gerardus Duyckinck I. In the section on Philadelphia, there’s an exquisite Thomas Sully portrait of Rebecca Gratz (1831), that calls attention to this influential Philadelphia-born Jewish woman, a forward-thinking innovator who initiated the creation of Jewish Sunday schools and the benevolent society for Jewish women. Women, including Penina Moise (1797-1880), a Charleston poet who left her mark in both secular and Jewish circles, played a significant role in reforming religious practice tailored for American-born Jews. Her book of hymns for Charleston’s Beth Elohim is on display, as is her portrait by Theodore Sidney Moise (1808-1885), her nephew. An oil painting of the interior of Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim by Moise’s contemporary, Solomon Nunes Carvalho (1815-1897), was made by the artist based entirely on memory of his childhood synagogue after it burned in 1838 in the city’s devastating fire. Carvalho was a pioneering daguerreotype photographer who accompanied explorer John Fremont on his 1853 fifth westward expedition across the Rockies. His bestselling chronicle about the expedition is on view along with other paintings related to the trip. A new documentary, “Carvalho’s Journey,” by Steven Rivo, chronicles the little known story. A later painting, “Abraham Lincoln and Diogenes” (1865), owned by the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, makes a rare appearance. The closing section describes an age of experimentation in intellectual and artistic expression by Jewish Americans that includes a wealth of plays, poetry, religious texts and musical compositions, many part of Milberg’s collection. There’s also a large portrait of Uriah Phillips Levy, who rose to the rank of Commodore in the US Navy, along with his sword and scabbard. Levy is credited with persuading Congress to end the practice of flogging in the Navy. There are two paintings by the renowned 19th century artist Camille Pissarro. The impressionist artist, whose mother was Jewish, was born on St. Thomas. Both paintings depict scenes from his native Caribbean island. For his part, Milberg said that he hopes the exhibit brings to light the ways in which Jews were part of America from its beginnings. “I wanted to show that Jews were an important part of the fabric of America,” he said. Two related programs are scheduled at The New-York Historical Society. Monday, January 30: Jews in America: From the Colonial Period to the Civil War, with Dale Rosengarten, Rabbi Meir Y. Soloveichik, and Louis Mirrer. Wednesday, February 15: Jews and the Making of Modern America, with Abraham Foxman ||||| It is perhaps the most significant artifact documenting the arrival of Jews in the New World: a small, tattered 16th-century manuscript written in an almost microscopic hand by Luis de Carvajal the Younger, the man whose life and pain it chronicled. Until 1932, the 180-page booklet by de Carvajal, a secret Jew who was burned at the stake by the Inquisition in Spain’s colony of Mexico, resided in that country’s National Archives. Then it vanished. The theft transformed the manuscript into an object of obsession, a kind of Maltese Falcon, for a coterie of Inquisition scholars and rare-book collectors. Almost nothing was heard about the document for more than 80 years — until it showed up 13 months ago at a London auction house. The manuscript was on sale for 1,500, because the house had little sense of its value. But last year the relic caught the eye of a prominent collector of Judaica, Leonard Milberg, when it showed up for resale at the Swann Galleries in Manhattan. It was now priced at more than 50 times what it had sold for just a few months earlier in England. Mr. Milberg consulted a variety of experts, who told him it might be the actual manuscript, and worth as much as 500,000. They also warned him to be careful — the original had been reported stolen. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In the late 16th century, Luis de Carbajal the Younger, a Spanish-born \\"converso\\" Jew living in Mexico, was put on trial by the Mexican Inquisition and, under torture, betrayed more than 120 people practicing their faith in secret.

Premise: In the U.S., power plants emit significant amounts of air 67 percent of all sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, 37 percent of mercury emissions, and 25 percent of all nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Hypothesis: In the U.S., the power plants contribute greatly to emissions pollutants. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The information provided in the premise establishes a clear connection between power plants in the U.S. and their significant contribution to emissions of pollutants. The premise lists the following percentages of emissions that can be attributed to power plants in the U.S.: - 67 percent of all sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions - 37 percent of mercury emissions - 25 percent of all nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions These percentages are quite substantial, which supports the hypothesis that power plants contribute greatly to emissions of pollutants in the U.S. Let's analyze each of these pollutants further to understand the implications of these percentages. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a toxic gas primarily associated with the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, in power plants. SO2 emissions can lead to the formation of fine particles and acid rain, both of which can have detrimental effects on human health and the environment. With power plants responsible for 67% of all SO2 emissions in the U.S., they play a significant role in contributing to this specific type of pollution. Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that can be released into the air through industrial activities, such as coal combustion in power plants. Once released, mercury can travel long distances, eventually settling in water bodies and contaminating fish populations. This has serious consequences for both human and ecosystem health. Given that power plants are responsible for 37% of mercury emissions in the U.S., they are a key source of this hazardous pollutant. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are a group of reactive gases that contribute to the formation of smog, ground-level ozone, and fine particles. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, aggravate pre-existing heart and lung conditions, and have adverse effects on the environment. Power plants are responsible for 25% of all NOx emissions in the U.S., which demonstrates their substantial contribution to this type of pollution. Considering the significant percentages of SO2, mercury, and NOx emissions attributable to power plants in the U.S., the premise clearly supports the hypothesis that the power plants contribute greatly to emissions pollutants. This highlights the need for further research and implementation of strategies to reduce emissions and mitigate the associated health and environmental risks. Such strategies may include transitioning to cleaner energy sources, implementing emissions control technologies, and enforcing stricter regulations on air pollutants from power plants."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

London (CNN) -- In the week between her death and her funeral, Britons are having an awkward time coming to terms with the legacy of Margaret Thatcher, a prime minister who last held office 23 years ago -- meaning no one under 40 could have voted for her, yet the mix of anger and admiration is spread across the generations. The emotional outpouring in this famously undemonstrative nation is matched in recent memory only by the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, when flowers piled up outside royal palaces and Elton John's mawkish \\"Candle in the Wind\\" surged to the top of the charts. But while Diana was mourned in unity by millions as the \\"people's princess,\\" Thatcher's death is being marked in widely different and unpredictable ways. WATCH: Not everyone's mourning Thatcher's death It has become an overused adjective in the media that Thatcher was \\"divisive.\\" Some countries might put aside political differences and unite to respect the passing of a leader -- especially the first and only female PM, who won three successive general elections. But in the UK debate about Thatcher is raging almost as fiercely as it did in the 1980s over issues like the privatization of industries, the Falklands War, tax and social policy, her close relationship with American President Ronald Reagan and combative stance against the European Union. To many she was the woman who broke the mold, showing the way for others, and the leader who made \\"Britain great again,\\" according to PM David Cameron. Geri Halliwell, aka \\"Ginger Spice\\" from the 1990s girl band the Spice Girls, spoke for many when she tweeted this tribute: \\"Thinking of our 1st Lady of girl power, Margaret Thatcher, a grocer's daughter who taught me anything is possible...x.\\" Halliwell later deleted the tweet in the face of online criticism, but went on to regret the move, describing herself as \\"weak\\" and cowardly.

Memory is our ability to learn something, save it and recall it when needed. Our memories are important to our sense of self, our personalities, and our ability to understand the world. Scientists say that there are different types of memory. There is short-term memory and long-term memory. Your short-term memory saves information for a few seconds or a few minutes. For example, the time it takes to compare the prices of a few items in a store. Long-term memory involves the information you try hard to keep, because it's meaningful to you (an example is data about family and friends. ) And then there is visual memory and sound memory. But these are not hard and fast: scientists argue a lot about the nature of memory. Scientists have also found that people memorize things in different ways. Some memorize better with the help of pictures. Others are helped more by sounds. One thing's for sure. If you can combine different kinds of memory together, you will remember a lot! So why not try pictures with English words? At the same time listen to recordings of the same group of words. It may help when it comes to memorizing it.

Title: Octopussy Movie plot: British agent 009 is found dead at the British embassy in East Berlin, dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake FabergÃ© egg. MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and, after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London, sends James Bond to investigate and find out the identity of the seller. At the auction, Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan, forcing Khan to pay Â£500,000 for the fake egg. Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan, India, where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon. Bond escapes with his Indian colleague Vijay, evading Khan's bodyguard Gobinda's attempts to kill them both. Bond is seduced by one of Khan's associates, Magda, and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo. Bond permits Magda to steal the real FabergÃ© egg fitted with a listening device by Q, while Gobinda captures Bond and takes him to Khan's palace. After Bond escapes from his cell he listens in on the bug in the FabergÃ© egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov, a Soviet general, who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe. After escaping from Khan's palace, Bond infiltrates a floating palace in Udaipur, India, and there finds its owner, Octopussy, a wealthy business woman and smuggler and an associate of Khan. She also leads the Octopus cult, of which Magda is a member. In Octopussy's palace, Bond finds out that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures, replacing them with replicas while Khan has been smuggling the real versions into the West via Octopussy's circus troupe. Orlov is planning to meet Khan at Karl-Marx-Stadt (Chemnitz) in East Germany, where the circus is scheduled to perform. After evading Khan's assassins, who killed Vijay, Bond goes to East Germany.

For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur.

Two farms were situated on opposite banks of a large river flowing into the ocean. Hill farm practiced conventional agriculture, while Dew farm practiced permaculture design within the context of organic farming. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm generated more marine litter? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Hill farm, which practiced conventional agriculture, likely generated more marine litter. Conventional agriculture often involves the use of non-organic fertilizers and chemicals, which can contribute to marine pollution when they enter the waterways.

Late in the 18th century the first wave of Romantics such as Goethe and Turner came to admire the scenery; Wordsworth visited the area in 1790, writing of his experiences in The Prelude.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what animal can regrow middle segments when broken?\\" is \\"geckos\\", given that earthworms have the ability to regrow segments that break off? The answer is:","completion":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what animal can regrow middle segments when broken?\\" is not \\"geckos,\\" even though they have regenerative capabilities. Geckos can regenerate their tails but not middle segments of their body. Instead, a more accurate answer would be \\"planarians\\" or \\"flatworms,\\" which possess the remarkable capability to regrow entire body sections when broken apart, including middle segments. Earthworms, as mentioned in the question, can regenerate some parts of their body if mishaps occur, but their regenerative capacity is somewhat limited compared to planarians. When an earthworm is injured or loses a small portion of its posterior or anterior end, it can regrow the missing parts to some extent. However, if they lose a significant part of their body or if the damage occurs in the middle segments, they may not survive or adequately regenerate. On the other hand, planarians, a type of flatworm, are renowned for their extraordinary regenerative capabilities. When a planarian gets severed, each fragment can regrow entire missing body parts, resulting in the formation of a new, complete organism. Their regenerative prowess is due to a large number of pluripotent stem cells, called neoblasts, which can differentiate into various cell types and restore the missing tissues. These neoblasts participate in the process of regeneration, not only in response to injuries but also as a means of asexual reproduction. This astounding regenerative ability allows planarians to rebuild any body part, including middle segments, from a small fragment. In conclusion, although both earthworms and geckos possess regenerative capabilities, their abilities are limited in comparison to planarians. While geckos can regenerate their tails, they cannot regrow entire middle segments when broken. Earthworms, too, can regrow missing portions of their body but may struggle if the damage involves significant parts or middle segments. Therefore, the most accurate answer to the given question would be \\"planarians\\" or \\"flatworms,\\" as their regenerative capabilities are truly remarkable, allowing them to regrow entire body sections, including middle segments, when broken apart."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Born on March 13, 1929, in West Hartford, Connecticut, Mascolo was introduced to the world of acting and music at a young age. Before venturing into acting, he was an accomplished musician, playing the clarinet and studying at several prestigious music institutions, including the University of Miami. Joseph Mascolo's acting career began in the 1960s when he appeared on stage in various Off-Broadway productions. He later made his way into television and film roles. His first major role on television began in 1968 with the TV series The Doctors, but his big breakthrough came in 1982 when he joined Days of Our Lives as the iconic villain, Stefano DiMera. The character of Stefano DiMera, also known as \\"The Phoenix,\\" is a powerful and ruthless crime lord, central to many convoluted plots that drive the storylines in the fictional town of Salem. Mascolo's brilliant portrayal of Stefano earned him widespread recognition, and he became a fan-favorite villain on the soap opera. Mascolo played the role on and off from 1982 to 2016, and his character was known to \\"rise from the ashes\\" multiple times, often returning from presumed death to wreak havoc on the citizens of Salem. During his time on Days of Our Lives, Joseph Mascolo also appeared in several other television series and films. He played roles in popular shows such as All My Children, General Hospital, and The Bold and the Beautiful. Mascolo received multiple awards for his role as Stefano DiMera, including the Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Villain in 1984, 1985, and 1992. In 2005, he was honored once again with the Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Villain - Lifetime Achievement. Unfortunately, the talented actor passed away on December 8, 2016, after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. Despite his demise, Joseph Mascolo's magnificent portrayal of Stefano DiMera continues to live on in the memories of Days of Our Lives' fans, contributing to the show's enduring legacy as one of the longest-running television series in American history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Russian language: The language was first introduced in North America when Russian explorers voyaged into Alaska and claimed it for Russia during the 1700s. Although most colonists left after the United States bought the land in 1867, a handful stayed and preserved the Russian language in this region to this day, although only a few elderly speakers of this unique dialect are left. Sizable Russian-speaking communities also exist in North America, especially in large urban centers of the U.S. and Canada, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Los Angeles, Nashville, San Francisco, Seattle, Spokane, Toronto, Baltimore, Miami, Chicago, Denver and Cleveland. In a number of locations they issue their own newspapers, and live in ethnic enclaves (especially the generation of immigrants who started arriving in the early 1960s). Only about 25% of them are ethnic Russians, however. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the overwhelming majority of Russophones in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn in New York City were Russian-speaking Jews. Afterward, the influx from the countries of the former Soviet Union changed the statistics somewhat, with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians immigrating along with some more Russian Jews and Central Asians. According to the United States Census, in 2007 Russian was the primary language spoken in the homes of over 850,000 individuals living in the United States.

Sourdough and whole wheat bread can also be good options. Starting with bread that has some moisture will result in less dry toast. Step 2: Adjust the toaster setting - Set the toaster to a lower or medium setting to prevent over-toasting the bread, which can cause excessive dryness. In case you don't have a toaster, you can use an oven or a pan on the stovetop. Step 3: Time it right - Keep an eye on the toast as it cooks. Remove it from the toaster, oven, or pan before it becomes too brown or crispy. This will help retain some moisture in the toast. Step 4: Add some spread - As soon as the toast is done, apply a thin layer of butter, margarine or any other spread of your choice. This will not only add flavor but also trap some moisture in the bread, preventing it from drying out. For a healthier option, you can use avocado or hummus. Step 5: Serve immediately - Toast has a tendency to dry out quickly as it cools down, so serve it as soon as possible. This ensures you enjoy the toast when it's still moist and warm.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Magma cools inside the crust - Magma crystalizes - Lava cools on the surface - Lava crystalizes - Minerals dissolved in water crystlize. Question: suppose volcano opens far inland happens, how will it affect more magma cools. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"In the given process, we can see the following sequence: 1. Magma cools inside the crust. 2. Magma crystallizes. 3. Lava cools on the surface. 4. Lava crystallizes. 5. Minerals dissolved in water crystallize. Now, let's consider the hypothetical situation: A volcano opens far inland. In this case, the eruption might cause more magma to rise and cool inside the Earth's crust. When analyzing the effect of this event on the second step (magma crystallizes), we can conclude that more magma cooling in the crust could result in more magma crystallizing. This is because the cooling process promotes the formation of crystals as the temperature drops and the solidification process occurs.

In this context, it serves as a filler word used to show agreement or to indicate that what you're about to say is related to the previous conversation topic. \\"No\\" in Czech often retains a similar conversational function as \\"well\\" does in English. - \\"He said\\" translates to \\"řekl,\\" with \\"ře\\" (pronounced like a softly rolled \\"rzh\\" sound), \\"k\\" and \\"l\\" sounds. This word indicates that it is a statement made by a male third person, referring to what he said in the past. - \\"He'd be\\" can be translated as \\"že bude.\\" \\"Že\\" (pronounced \\"zheh\\") is used to introduce a subordinate clause, and it corresponds to the English word \\"that.\\" In this case, it refers to the information the man shared about his attendance to the wedding. \\"Bude\\" (pronounced \\"boo-deh\\") is a future tense form of the verb \\"být\\" (to be) and shows that he would be attending the event in the future. - \\"At your\\" translates to \\"na tvé\\" (pronounced \\"na tveh\\"). \\"Na\\" (pronounced \\"nah\\") is a preposition that can be translated in various ways, with \\"on\\", \\"at\\", \\"in\\" being some of its possible meanings. In this context, it means \\"at\\" since it relates to attending an event (the wedding). \\"Tvé\\" (pronounced \\"tveh\\") is the possessive form of \\"you\\" in Czech, which shows that the wedding belongs to the person being addressed. - \\"Wedding\\" translates to \\"svatbě\\" (pronounced \\"svat-beh\\"), which is a dative form of the word \\"svatba,\\" meaning \\"wedding\\" or \\"marriage.\\" In this context, the dative form is used because it is required by the preposition \\"na\\" in phrases referring to attending events.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope for hides?, using the article: There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"To answer your first question: 1. Assess your comfort level: Start by evaluating how comfortable you are in your current situation. Determine the aspects of your life that you find comfortable and those where you feel challenged. 2. Define your goals: Clearly define the goals you want to achieve, both short-term and long-term. These should be realistic and in line with your capabilities and interests. 3. Develop a plan: Create a step-by-step plan to gradually push yourself out of your comfort zone. This should involve breaking down your goals into smaller, achievable tasks and allocating time for each task. Make sure to set specific deadlines and be accountable. 4.

Step 1: Analyze the context The sentence describes a situation where Danni is trying to solve a mystery and ends up solving an anagram. Step 2: Examine Option I In the first option, the mystery was easier, it implies that the anagram was harder than the mystery. Since Danni only managed to solve the anagram, this option seems less appropriate, as it would be logical for Danni to solve the easier mystery rather than the harder anagram. Step 3: Examine Option II In the second option, the anagram was easier, which implies that Danni could solve the anagram because it was easier than the mystery itself. This makes more sense, as Danni would have likely chosen the easier task of solving an anagram over the more difficult mystery.

Sightings have occurred in all the countries bordering Germany, which hosts the largest population outside of North America. Another stable population exists in northern France, where several pet raccoons were released by members of the U.S. Air Force near the Laon-Couvron Air Base in 1966. Furthermore, raccoons have been known to be in the area around Madrid since the early 1970s. In 2013, the city authorized \\"the capture and death of any specimen\\". It is also present in Italy, with one reproductive population in Lombardy.About 1,240 animals were released in nine regions of the former Soviet Union between 1936 and 1958 for the purpose of establishing a population to be hunted for their fur. Two of these introductions were successful—one in the south of Belarus between 1954 and 1958, and another in Azerbaijan between 1941 and 1957. With a seasonal harvest of between 1,000 and 1,500 animals, in 1974 the estimated size of the population distributed in the Caucasus region was around 20,000 animals and the density was four animals per square kilometer (10 animals per square mile).

Chihuahua (state) Hidalgo is hailed as the Father of the Nation even though it was Agustin de Iturbide and not Hidalgo who achieved Mexican Independence in 1821. Shortly after gaining independence, the day to celebrate it varied between September 16, the day of Hidalgo's Grito, and September 27, the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war. Later, political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, so that eventually September 16, 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence. The reason for this is that Hidalgo is considered to be \\"precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the (Mexican War of) Independence.\\" Hidalgo has become an icon for Mexicans who resist tyranny in the country. Diego Rivera painted Hidalgo's image in half a dozen murals. José Clemente Orozco depicted him with a flaming torch of liberty and considered the painting among his best work. David Alfaro Siqueiros was commissioned by San Nicolas University in Morelia to paint a mural for a celebration commemorating the 200th anniversary of Hidalgo's birth. The town of his parish was renamed Dolores Hidalgo in his honor and the state of Hidalgo was created in 1869. Every year on the night of 15–16 September, the president of Mexico re-enacts the Grito from the balcony of the National Palace.

Make sure to cover all areas of your face, avoiding your eyes and mouth. 5. Allow it to sit: Once your face is covered, let the banana peel residue sit on your skin for about 15-20 minutes. This will give your skin enough time to absorb the nutrients. 6. Rinse your face: After the allocated time, gently wash your face with lukewarm water to remove the banana peel residue.

Davis, Calif., unveiled a statue of the champion for non-violent protest Sunday, and fittingly, things started out peaceful. Then dozens of protesters, some of whom had come from hours away, arrived. \\"They would like to perpetuate this Hollywood version of Gandhi so you (do not) pay attention to the fact that Americans here are supporting the brutalization of minorities back in India,\\" one protester told KCRA. Added another, \\"I don't understand why America is supporting him when America stands for freedom and Gandhi is not the ideal person for freedom.\\" The statue was a gift from the Indian government and was unveiled on Gandhi's birthday, the UN's International Day of Non-Violence, the Sacramento Bee reports. Protesters shouted things like, \\"Gandhi, Gandhi you can’t hide, you committed genocide.\\" The Bee notes that most of the supporters watching the statue's unveiling were Indian-Americans. The protesters said Gandhi was a racist and a child molester, which KCRA notes \\"is a narrative that is not supported by mainstream historical scholars.\\" Others called him sexist and said he was a proponent of India's caste system; some have gone so far as to accuse him of genocide and of starting ISIS. The Bee has some background on their accusations, noting that the pedophile comments come from Gandhi's practice of testing his chastity vow by sleeping naked with his teen grandnieces and that even Gandhi's own grandson has admitted that Gandhi was \\"at times ignorant and prejudiced about South Africa's blacks.\\" Even so, Rajmohan Gandhi has said, his grandfather paved the way for the civil rights movement.

The controversial reception of the statue, a gift from the Indian government, began peacefully but soon saw dozens of protestors arrive, expressing their discontent with the representation of Gandhi. Protesters criticized the \\"Hollywood version\\" of Gandhi, accusing Americans of supporting the oppression of minorities in India. Despite America standing as a symbol of freedom, some argued that Gandhi was not the ideal icon of freedom. The statue was unveiled on Gandhi's birthday, which is also recognized as the United Nations' International Day of Non-Violence. Shouts of \\"Gandhi, Gandhi you can’t hide, you committed genocide\\" echoed during the protest, which mostly featured Indian-Americans supporting the statue. The protesters claimed that Gandhi was racist, a child molester, sexist, and an advocate of India's caste system. They further accused him of genocide and even of starting ISIS. However, these narratives are not supported by mainstream historical scholars. The allegations of pedophilia stem from Gandhi's practice of testing his vow of chastity by sleeping naked with his teenage grandnieces. His grandson, Rajmohan Gandhi, has acknowledged that his grandfather was at times uninformed and prejudiced towards South Africa's black population.

Don’t assume they have disabilities.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Importance of Respectful Communication and Assistance to the Elderly Introduction In today's fast-paced society, it is quite easy to overlook the importance of treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their age or physical abilities. While younger generations may not often consider how their actions affect others, it is important to remember that building an inclusive and supportive community requires genuine efforts of empathy and assistance. This article aims to emphasize the significance of addressing people with respectful titles, offering assistance proactively, and debunking assumptions based on appearances. 1. Addressing People with Respectful Titles Referring to individuals as \\"sir\\" or \\"ma'am\\" is a display of courtesy and recognition of their personhood. It demonstrates that you acknowledge them as someone deserving of respect and politeness. This is particularly important when interacting with older individuals, who may be accustomed to such formalities and appreciate the gesture of being addressed with proper honorifics. By using respectful titles when addressing elderly people, you are not only honoring their age and experience but also providing them with an environment conducive to positive communication and interaction. As the old saying goes, \\"respect is earned, not given.\\" Therefore, when you offer your respect to others, they are more inclined to reciprocate, leading to healthier, more harmonious interpersonal relationships. 2. Offer Your Help Another critical aspect of creating a supportive community is consciously offering help to those around you, especially elderly individuals who may require assistance at times – be it crossing the street, carrying groceries, or finding a misplaced item. However, it's essential to first gauge the situation before lending your aid. Many older individuals value their independence and may feel uncomfortable if help is forcefully provided. Instead, approach the person with genuine concern and politely offer your assistance, allowing them to accept or decline your offer. In some situations where elderly people are hesitant to ask for help, your proactive display of goodwill can be an immense relief. By respectfully offering your aid, you create an atmosphere of kindness and empathy that ultimately benefits everyone. 3. Be Patient Cultivating patience while dealing with older individuals is vital. As we age, our cognitive abilities and reaction times may slow down. This can cause frustration for both the elderly and those around them. It's essential to remember that exhibiting patience and understanding can soothe any tension and create a more inclusive environment. Showing patience reflects your empathy towards the challenges older people may face and reinforces a positive mindset that acknowledges and accommodates their needs. By providing them with the time and space they require, you are sending a clear message of your commitment to treating them with genuine respect and care. 4. Debunking Assumptions of Disabilities It is important not to assume that older individuals have disabilities, just as it's crucial not to assume that all disabilities are visible. Treat each person as an individual with their unique set of abilities and challenges. Painting everyone with the same brush based on age is both disrespectful and unfair. Instead, take the time to know the person, understand their circumstances, and tailor your approach to respect their individuality. Just as younger people should not be underestimated, neither should older individuals be stereotyped. Conclusion In conclusion, fostering a community of understanding and support requires not only words but also actions. Addressing people with respect, offering help when needed, being patient, and not succumbing to assumptions can make all the difference for the elderly population. By affirming their dignity and personhood, we contribute to building a more inclusive society, where everyone thrives regardless of their age or physical abilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Anglo-Saxon \\"axe bearers\\" had been amongst the most effective of the city's defenders, but they now attempted to negotiate higher wages from their Byzantine employers, before dispersing or surrendering. The crusaders captured the Blachernae section of the city in the northwest and used it as a base to attack the rest of the city. While attempting to defend themselves with a wall of fire, however, they burned even more of the city. This second fire left 15,000 people homeless. The crusaders completely took the city on 13 April. The crusaders sacked Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Byzantine works of art were stolen or ruined. Many of the civilian population of the city were killed and their property looted. Despite the threat of excommunication, the crusaders destroyed, defiled and looted the city's churches and monasteries. It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 silver marks. The Venetians received 150,000 silver marks that was their due, while the crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many crusader knights.

The question asks what happens soon after Christmas, which implies we need to find an event or occasion that occurs relatively shortly after Christmas. 2. Analyzing the possible answers: - Buy presents for others: Buying presents is typically associated with the Christmas season and not an event that happens after Christmas. - Summer: Christmas occurs during winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer is still a few months away, so this option doesn't fit the \\"soon after\\" criteria. - Easter: Easter is a Christian holiday that usually takes place in the spring, a few months after Christmas. This option seems more plausible. - See work: Seeing work is not a specific event or occasion that can be associated directly with Christmas or a time soon after it. - Halloween: Halloween takes place in October, which is a few months before Christmas, so this option doesn't fit the \\"soon after\\" criteria. 3.

Is Thereafter, a distinctly Canadian army and navy was established, followed by an air force, that, because of the constitutional arrangements at the time, remained effectively under the control of the British government until Canada gained legislative independence from the United Kingdom in 1931, in part due to the distinguished achievement and sacrifice of the Canadian Corps in the First World War. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, the given statement provides a brief overview of the formation of the Canadian Armed Forces. However, to provide a more detailed and long answer, consider the following: The origins of the Canadian Armed Forces can be traced back to the early colonial militias in the 1600s. By the 19th century, Canada had a regular army comprised of British troops, as well as its own volunteer militia forces. The British garrison stationed in Canada was gradually reduced during the latter half of the 19th century, which led to the formation of a distinctly Canadian army and navy to fill the defensive void. In 1910, the Naval Service Act was passed, and the Royal Canadian Navy was officially founded on May 4, 1910. It played an important role during the First World War and continued to develop throughout the subsequent decades. The Canadian army, which had primarily been organized regionally through militia units in the early 20th century, significantly contributed to the war effort in the First World War. The Canadian Expeditionary Force was formed in 1914, and it included the Canadian Corps, which gained distinction for its efforts, particularly during battles such as Vimy Ridge and Passchendaele. After the end of the war, the Canadian government focused on creating a national military force. This led to the formation of the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1924 (established by the Air Force Act), a separate branch that would eventually become a crucial component of the Canadian Armed Forces. Despite having these separate military entities, Canada's military branches remained effectively under the control of the British government due to the constitutional arrangements at the time. This changed when the Statute of Westminster was passed in 1931, which granted Canada legislative independence from the United Kingdom. Afterward, the Canadian government had full authority over its military forces. In 1940, during World War II, the National Defence Act was amended, which centralized the control of all Canadian military forces under a single department, the Department of National Defence. This was a major step toward consolidating the Canadian military services. In 1968, as a result of the efforts to further integrate the Canadian military, the Canadian Armed Forces were established through the unification of the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Air Force under one entity. In conclusion, the development of the Canadian Armed Forces spans over many years and involves the establishment of distinct branches such as the army, navy, and air force. The military forces were originally under British control but eventually gained full autonomy after Canada achieved legislative independence in 1931. Throughout the years, these various branches have been integrated into one cohesive military force, the Canadian Armed Forces, which serves and protects Canada and contributes to international peacekeeping missions and alliances, such as NATO."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This was formalized in their Punto Fijo Pact, which essentially divvied up the political power between them, ensuring that they maintained rule over the country. Simultaneously, the Communist Party found itself isolated and marginalized as they were not included in this pact. In response to their exclusionary treatment, they resorted to initiating a guerrilla war - typically a form of irregular warfare that utilizes small, mobile armed groups in opposition to traditional military forces. However, they faced significant challenges as they found themselves either being coerced or assimilated into the existing alliance between the AD and COPEI, or conversely, being militarily defeated. It concludes a phase of Venezuelan history where power was concentrated in the hands of these two parties. The alliances, deals, and division of power meant that other political entities, such as the Communist Party, found it challenging to assert their influence or change the political setup of the country.

The goods that were being purchased were more useful than the displays since the","completion":"consumers recognized the inherent value they held in their daily lives, offering practicality and utility unlike the ostentatious displays often understood to be more of a status symbol. The rise in demand for these practical goods could be attributed to various factors, including changing societal priorities, financial considerations, and the pursuit of simplicity and minimalism in modern life. As people began to emphasize the importance of experiences over material possessions, they started to look for products that could enhance their lives in tangible ways rather than merely presenting an image of luxury or success. One major contributor to this shift was the global economic climate, which had inevitably impacted consumer behavior. Following a period of instability, many found themselves questioning the need to constantly acquire new and expensive items to assert their status. Furthermore, a significant portion of the population had become more conscious about the environment, making efforts to reduce waste and adopt more sustainable practices in their lifestyles. This has also affected consumption patterns, as sustainable and reusable goods are often seen as more practical and long-lasting investments. Regarding societal changes, the rapid development of technology has led to a faster pace of life where people are constantly connected and easily overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information and digital stimuli. As a result, individuals have started seeking simplicity in their environments, which in turn has given rise to the popularity of minimalist design and living. This inclination towards minimalism has prompted consumers to reassess their priorities and identify the true value of products. In such a context, the usefulness of a product becomes more crucial than its visual appeal. Another factor that has influenced the preference for useful and practical goods is the growing popularity of DIY and self-sufficiency culture. Many individuals are embracing the idea of creating, repairing, and maintaining items on their own rather than relying on others for these services. This trend has brought about a higher demand for products that enable and facilitate these endeavors, such as tools, materials, and equipment. It has also encouraged the notion of investing in durable and high-quality goods, which are expected to endure regular wear and tear and offer consistent performance for longer periods. Moreover, consumer education has played a pivotal role in shaping the demand for practical goods. As people become more aware of the impact of their purchases on their health, well-being, and the environment, they are more likely to choose products that align with their values. For instance, there has been an increase in demand for organic food, eco-friendly cleaning products, and natural personal care items, as these goods are perceived to benefit both the users and the planet. Lastly, consumers have come to recognize that practical goods do not necessarily sacrifice aesthetics. There is a growing appreciation for items that integrate form and function seamlessly, providing visually appealing objects that also serve meaningful purposes. Thus, the idea that practical goods are somehow plain or boring has gradually dissipated. In conclusion, the preference for practical goods over flashy displays in the market can be ascribed to a multitude of factors that reflect evolving consumer mindsets and values. Amidst economic uncertainties, environmental concerns, and a fast-paced digital world, people have sought solace in items that offer true usefulness and durability. These goods, which prioritize functionality without disregarding design, ultimately contribute to a more simplified, sustainable, and meaningful way of living."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kim Kardashian's naked butt cover: a historical perspective With a brief to “break the internet”, New York-based style magazine Paper has unveiled their latest cover – an oiled Kim Kardashian displaying her naked backside. In fact, there are two covers – the second is a more demure shot showing Kim fully clothed and balancing a glass of champagne on her bum. While Kardashian – with her trajectory from sex tape to reality star to the cover of Vogue, and now back to her birthday suit – is a very 21st-century kind of celebrity, the photographer, Jean-Paul Goude, did his pioneering work in the 70s and 80s. The champagne shot is a recreation of a 1976 photograph of model Carolina Burmont. Made art director of Esquire in 1969, despite having little experience laying out pages, Goude’s career took a different turn when he met Grace Jones in 1977 (or ’78 – the photographer can’t remember as “it was a period of decadence”). Jones was a Jamaican model with stunning androgynous looks. A dedicated hedonist and habituee of Studio 54, she had already made a disco album and was massively popular on the New York gay scene. “She was singing her hit song I Need a Man to a roomful of shrieking, gay bobbysoxers,” remembered Goude. “The ambiguity of her act was that she herself looked like a man. A man singing I Need a Man to a bunch of men.” Goude not only fell in love with her, but decided to take control of her image, treating her a bit like a living artwork. Decades before photoshop, armed with little more than his own surrealist, sexually charged vision and a steady hand, Goude created astonishing images of Jones with the primitive technology available at the time – not much more than scalpels, glue and multiple contact sheets. You can see him at work in the very first seconds of this video for Jones’s Slave to the Rhythm. He described the process in his book Jungle Fever, copies of which now go for hundreds of pounds. “I photographed her in different positions. I cut her legs apart, lengthened them, turned her body to face the audience.” For the cover of her third album, Nightclubbing, which abandoned disco for a much more avant-garde fusion of reggae and new wave, Goude turned Jones’s already dark skin blue-black, making her look forbidding, masculine, and drop dead cool. Goude and Jones’s work is still deeply influential; moments from the live concert they created, called A One Man Show, regularly crop up in film, advertising and other live concerts. However, even at the time he was criticised for objectifying the bodies of black women. Kim Kardashian’s enlarged, glazed buttocks show that while his techniques have changed – he almost certainly used a computer – his predilections have not, only now they seem to be shared by the whole of the internet.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What would be built on a foundation of rock? Possible A: pillars, mountains, bridge, mountain range, surface of earth Why is \\"bridge\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"The answer \\"bridge\\" is aligned with human common sense when discussing a structure built on a foundation of rock for several reasons. These reasons take into account the practical and functional aspects of bridges, their historical development, and human experience with rock foundations. 1. Engineering and design principles: Bridges are engineered structures designed to span physical obstacles such as bodies of water, valleys, or roads, and they need a strong and stable foundation to support their weight and the loads they bear. A rock foundation provides the required strength and stability as rocks are naturally strong, unyielding, and highly resistant to various forces such as compression, tension, and erosion. 2. Geological benefits: Rock foundations typically offer better support and structural integrity compared to other foundations, such as those built on soil or marshy ground. Rock foundations minimize settlement, erosion, and other issues that could compromise the stability of a bridge. Building on rock ensures that the foundation remains intact and secure for an extended period, reducing the likelihood of bridge failure and maintenance costs. 3. Historical context: Throughout history, many important bridges have been built on rock foundations. The Pont du Gard in France, for example, is an ancient Roman aqueduct bridge built on limestone bedrock. Notably, these structures have withstood the test of time and are considered marvels of engineering and design. This historical association reinforces the human understanding of why bridges are built on rock foundations. 4. Safety and reliability: Human common sense also emphasizes the importance of safety and reliability when constructing structures like bridges. Building a bridge on a rock foundation essentially ensures that the structure is more secure, as it remains less susceptible to damage caused by natural occurrences like floods, landslides, or earthquakes. This sense of safety and stability resonates with people's intuitive understanding of engineering requirements for a secure and long-lasting bridge. 5. Environmental impact: When selecting a site for constructing a bridge, it is essential to minimize the impact on the surrounding environment, including the natural landscape and local ecosystems. By building a bridge on a rock foundation, the need for extensive excavation or land modification is significantly reduced. This choice often aligns with environmentally friendly and sustainable construction practices. In conclusion, the answer \\"bridge\\" is aligned with human common sense when discussing structures built on a foundation of rock due to its strong engineering and design principles, geological benefits, historical context, emphasis on safety and reliability, and minimal environmental impact. These factors combined create a general understanding and acceptance of the rationale behind using rock foundations for bridge construction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tom had hypertension and the doc told him to change his diet. Which friend didn't have to start eating spinach? Hint: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate.

Firstly, the user interface experience is horrendous. The app is not intuitive, and I found myself getting lost in the labyrinth of menus. I spent more time trying to find the functionality I needed than actually using the app for its intended purpose, which was to secure my accounts. Another glaring issue is the frequent crashes and instability. It seems like every other time I attempt to use the app, I am met with an abrupt freezing or crashing of the app. This has caused me a great deal of frustration, especially when I needed it to access crucial information or confirmations. The app's unreliability has put my security at risk, discouraging me from trusting it with my personal data. Moreover, the QR code scanning feature is incredibly problematic. The camera struggled to focus on the QR code and kept adjusting the lens, resulting in a prolonged and irritating process just to scan a simple code. Other apps with the same functionality perform far better and more smoothly in comparison. Customer support has hardly been of any help. My queries and complaints were met with generic and unhelpful responses, leaving me with no choice but to look for answers elsewhere. The lack of proper assistance further degraded my experience with the app. Lastly, the failure to sync across multiple devices has rendered this app useless for me, leaving me in search of alternatives.

It turns out that Owen is actually a priest sent by the Vatican to get a blood sample from a possessed girl named Tristana Medeiros, the same attacker from the end of the previous film. At the penthouse, Tristana is nowhere to be found. Larra, one of the GEO operators, finds a sample of her blood â the only one that the original priest took from her.

I've been keeping count of how often people sing around the house these days. The fact is, they don't. My earliest memories are of my mother crooning lullabies in a gentle low voice as she rocked each infant in turn. She said she \\"didn't have a singing voice,\\" but her low, wavering alto will always mean comfort to me. Every time I have sat through the night with a feverish body or held a pre - schooler through a nightmare, the melodies returned, words appearing and disappearing like fragments of a dream but held together by the hum of love. Today, young mothers are routinely presented with lullaby tapes at the baby shower. When baby cries, the idea goes, they will be able to switch on the high-tech audio system and _ with the voices of strangers in his ears, perfectly on pitch. If I had my way, new parents would learn the songs themselves, throw out their stereos, and give their child the gift of their own sleepy voices through the midnight hours. These days, when we go on a trip, my daughters take along tiny personal stereos and headphones. They are lost in their private worlds, and I can't help wishing that at least here, in the car my girls would be forced to listen to their mother's voice again, sure I'm out-of-tune songs that they might then pass down to another generation. Those sophisticated earphones have robbed them of something I think every kid should carry from childhood car trips into adulthood. I drove away from that party humming, and all the way home the good old songs kept tumbling out. Damm it , I thought, why did I ever stop singing in the car and start turning on the radio ? Why don't I sing anymore while I'm doing the dishes? I'm going to pull those stereo wires right out of the wall when I get home.

Article: You might not know it, but there is something wonderful at your fingertips. You can make people happier, healthier and more hard-working just by touching their arms or holding their hands. Doctors say that body contact is a kind of medicine that can work wonders. When people are touched, the quantity of hemoglobin -a type of matter that produces the red color in blood increases greatly. This results in more oxygen reaching every part of the body and the whole body benefits. In experiments, bottle-fed baby monkeys were separated from their mothers for the first ten days of life. They became sad and negative. Studies showed the monkeys were more probable to become ill than other babies that were allowed to stay with their mothers. Human babies react in much the same way. Some years ago, a scientist noticed that some well-fed babies in a clean nursery became weak. Yet babies in another nursery were growing healthily, even though they ate less well and were not kept as clean. The reason, he concluded, was that they often had touches from nurses. Experiments show that most people like being touched. And nearly all doctors believe touch helps to reduce patients' fear of treatment. Of course there is time when a touch is not welcome. But even if we don't like being touched, a smile can make us feel better. Smiling increases blood flow and starts the production of \\"happy brain\\" chemicals.

Please answer the following question: Question: When you are asleep at night and dreaming about monsters what are they? Choices: - nightmares - confusion - frightening - car accident - fantasy The rationale to choose \\"nightmares\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"Nightmares are the most fitting answer to the question about monsters appearing in one's dreams at night. The reason behind choosing \\"nightmares\\" over other options like confusion, frightening, car accident, and fantasy is that nightmares specifically refer to the distressing and fearful experiences we have while dreaming. Let us take a closer look at the rationale for selecting \\"nightmares\\" as the answer: 1. Nightmares: Nightmares are vivid, intense, and often unpleasant dreams that evoke negative emotions, such as fear, anxiety, sadness, or despair. The appearance of monsters in one's dreams at night can be categorized as nightmares due to the frightful and disturbing nature of such encounters. Experiencing nightmares might lead to a feeling of being threatened, endangered, or overwhelmed. 2. Confusion: While confusion might sometimes occur within the context of nightmares or other types of dreams, it doesn't specifically relate to the monsters appearing in one's dreams at night. Confusion in this context refers to the lack of clarity or uncertainty that might arise during a dream. The presence of monsters within a dream might contribute to this confusion, but it is not the most accurate answer. 3. Frightening: Frightening experiences or emotions might be an outcome of having a nightmare, but it doesn't accurately define the monsters within the dream. Frightening merely describes a feeling or reaction towards an experience, whereas nightmares are more related to the actual distressing and fearful dreams themselves. 4. Car accident: A car accident is a very specific situation that does not directly relate to the monsters appearing in one's dreams at night. While it is possible to dream about car accidents and experience nightmares as a result of them, it doesn't specifically describe the monsters within the dream. 5. Fantasy: While a fantasy could potentially involve monsters, fantasy as a concept generally refers to imaginative or creative scenarios that aren't based on reality. Though monsters might be present within those scenarios, it doesn't accurately represent the distressing and terrifying nature of the situation as described in the question. In conclusion, the appearance of monsters in one's dreams at night can be best described as nightmares due to their typically fearful and distressing qualities. While other options like confusion, frightening, car accident, and fantasy might hold some relevance to the overall experience of encountering monsters in dreams, none of them specifically pertain to the frightening, anxiety-inducing dream itself. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to this question would be \\"nightmares.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Recording sessions for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a group of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'état that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.Inspired by the mural, Bono took an extended break from recording into July, traveling to Nicaragua and El Salvador with his wife, Alison Hewson, to see first-hand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and US military intervention.

Here's a collection of insights into what the players eat before a match and while they're on the course. Bill Haas, winner of the 2011 FedEx Cup and player in the U.S. Open, is known for not eating much on the course, but when he does, he munches on a mixture of dried berries and nuts. His opponent, Jim Furyk is more inclined to eat during a match, opting for energy bars (and Larabars, specifically) between rounds. Tiger Woods, the 2008 U.S. Open champion, is often seen eating a piece of fruit, like an apple or banana, during a match. He also recently tweeted that his favorite thing to snack on while on the course is a peanut butter and banana sandwich and almonds. Furyk, the 2003 U.S. Open champion, maintains a healthy diet filled with fruits, vegetables, and plenty of Vitamin D and calcium to keep his bones strong. On the course he likes to keep energy bars on hand to sustain him; Furyk is particularly fond of Larabars. Acclaimed golfer Phil Mickelson initially adopted a vegetarian diet in 2010 after being diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, but after five months he went back to eating meat. Mickelson still maintains a vegetable-heavy diet, but supplements with lean meats and proteins. He has been spotted eating fruit, specifically bananas, and drinking water on the course. Swedish golf pro Carl Pettersson takes a fairly unconventional approach to dieting — after winning his fifth PGA Tour event this year he was quoted as saying that his diet, \\"10 beers and a tub of ice cream before bed,\\" was the key to his success. He says that he tried maintaining a strict diet a few years ago but it poorly affected his golf game. When he's out on the course, Keegan Bradley likes to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on multigrain bread, almonds, raisins, peanuts, trail mix and always packs a few Clif Bars.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: John Shay, a British MI5 agent, had grown up in the United States, and who was nearly killed while on assignment abroad. Convinced that he was framed, he returns to London to uncover the mole responsible for the set-up. John Shay suspects that his colleague Adam Booth is a Russian spy. The action takes place in London, Athens, Istanbul and Corfu, where Shay goes in his investigation trying to gather evidence that Booth is a double agent. When Shay's superiors are not convinced, and even after a special hearing clears Booth of any wrongdoing, he takes matters into his own hands and executes Booth.Shay assumes the identity of Booth, and, with the assistance of Booth's widow Sarah and his own girlfriend Polly, he launches into an investigation to uncover Booth's connections. Shay maintains a romantic relationship with both women. Booth's wife is the romantic interest of Shay and British scientist Philip Crawford, who provided information to Shay about Booth being a double agent. Shay's superiors are Col. Scott and Vaughan Jones. Polly assists him in his investigations by providing him with information apparently confirming his suspicions.Shay finds a plane ticket in Booth's pocket which he then uses to fly to Athens along with Booth's widow, who is unaware that her husband has been murdered by Shay. Upon arrival in Athens, Shay assumes Booth's identity and subsequently goes to Corfu, where he is captured along with Sarah by Soviet agents who want Crawford in return for the freedom of their captives. A CIA agent under the name of Professor Parker manages to free them both. Colonel Scott (Shay's superior) reveals that Sarah's husband was indeed a double agent who was used by MI5 to supply the Soviets with false information. answer the following question: What is the name of the woman who is the romantic interest of Philip Crawford? Answer:","completion":"The name of the woman who is the romantic interest of Philip Crawford is Sarah, who is also Booth's widow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth. Which planet would travel longer distance, Neptune or Earth? A:","completion":"Neptune would travel a longer distance than Earth in its orbit around the Sun. This is due to multiple factors, such as the difference in their orbital paths and their respective distances from the Sun. First, let's discuss the shape of a planet's orbit. A planet's orbit is an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the two foci (periastron and apastron). The distance from the Sun varies as the planet moves along its orbital path, coming closest at perihelion and farthest away at aphelion. The semi-major axis is the longest diameter of the ellipse and serves as an average distance between a planet and its star. In the case of the Solar System, the semi-major axis of Earth's orbit is approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) and Neptune's orbit is about 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers) from the Sun. This difference means that Neptune's orbit is about 30 times larger than Earth's orbit. Now let's consider the circumference of each planet's orbit, which we can use to determine the distance traveled by each planet during its complete revolution around the Sun. The circumference of an ellipse can be estimated using the formula: C ≈ π * (3(a + b) - ((3a + b)(a + 3b))^0.5), where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis of the ellipse. However, for simplicity's sake and since all the planets in the Solar System have orbits close to being circular, we can rely on the formula for the circumference of a circle to approximate the distance traveled: C ≈ 2π * a. Using this estimation, we can see that, given the longer semi-major axis of Neptune's orbit, it would travel a longer distance than Earth during one complete orbit around the Sun. Additionally, the period of one revolution (sidereal period, or year) for a planet is affected by its distance from the star. The farther a planet is from its star, the longer it takes for it to complete one orbit due to the weaker gravitational force it experiences from the star. Neptune has a sidereal period of about 165 Earth years, while Earth, of course, takes only one year to complete an orbit. This means Neptune's year, and therefore its orbit, is substantially longer than Earth's. In conclusion, based on the differences in the planets' orbital paths, distances from the Sun, and their sidereal periods, Neptune travels a much longer distance than Earth in its orbit around the Sun."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"The oldest tricolour flag in the world, first appearing in 1572, is the flag of the Netherlands. The Dutch flag, also known as the \\"Flag of the Prince,\\" has a rich history and a significant place in the annals of world flags. The flag of the Netherlands is a horizontal tricolour composed of red, white, and blue bands of equal width. The red band is on the top, followed by the white band in the middle, and finally the blue band at the bottom. It is important to note that the original flag, created in 1572, actually featured an orange band instead of the red one; this was due to the Dutch association with the House of Orange and William of Orange, who led the Dutch revolt against Spanish rule, initiating the Eighty Years' War. The flag was an important symbol for the newly formed Dutch Republic as the Netherlands fought for its independence from the Spanish Empire. The use of the orange, white, and blue colours represented the struggle for freedom and was adopted by Dutch nationalists, known as the \\"Geuzen,\\" who used the flag as a symbol of defiance. Orange-white-blue tricolour, known as the \\"Prinsenvlag\\" (Prince's flag), was inspired by the heraldic colours of William of Orange, which are seen in his coat of arms. The flag also represented the union of the Dutch provinces that joined together to fight against Spanish rule. In 1650, the orange band in the Dutch flag was replaced by the red one. The change is attributed to various factors, including different interpretations of the colours in the original flag, the fading of the orange dye into a shade too close to red, and the political allegiance of Holland (one of the seven United Provinces of the Dutch Republic) to the English commonwealth. Throughout history, the flag of the Netherlands has continued to be of significant importance. During the French occupation of the Netherlands in the late 18th century, the red-white-blue flag was temporarily replaced by a flag inspired by the French tricolour. However, once the French were expelled in 1813, the Dutch flag was reinstated, and since then, it has remained the national flag of the Netherlands. In conclusion, the Dutch flag has a long and storied history stretching back to 1572, and its tricolour design has earned it the title of the oldest tricolour flag in the world. It is not only a symbol of the Dutch nation but a testament to the country's history and its struggle for freedom and independence over the centuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided about natural selection and the specific context of Mike's observation in a cold mid-western city with less predator-prey interaction, it is likely that the squirrels with lighter coats would reproduce in smaller numbers compared to the darker coated squirrels. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that darker coats are more suitable in cold environments, as they help the organisms retain heat more effectively. Since Mike's city is cold, squirrels with darker coats would have a better chance of surviving the harsh conditions and comfortably adapting to their environment. This advantage would naturally lead to higher chances of reproduction for darker coated squirrels. In contrast, squirrels with lighter coats would struggle more in a cold environment, as their coats would not provide them with the same level of heat retention. This disadvantage would make their survival more difficult, and consequently, these squirrels would reproduce in smaller numbers. Over time, as natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common and unfavorable traits to become less common in a population, the number of lighter coated squirrels would likely decrease, while the darker coated squirrels become more prevalent in the area. It is important to note that other factors, such as availability of food resources and the presence of specific predators, might also influence the coat color variations observed in the squirrel population. However, based on the given context and the concept of natural selection, it is plausible to conclude that the lighter coated squirrels would most likely reproduce in smaller numbers compared to their darker counterparts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Auburn University (then known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute) in 1901. He had already decided on a military career and had become first sergeant of a cavalry company in the Alabama National Guard. However, he obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Alabama in 1903 and practiced law in Montgomery, Alabama for a year. After the latter assignment, General Smith assumed command of the 1st Marine Brigade at Quantico, taking that unit to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for extended amphibious training in October 1940. In February 1941, when the brigade was redesignated the U.S. 1st Marine Division, he became that organization's first commander. He returned with the division to Quantico in April 1941, and in June of that year he was detached from it to take command of the organization that eventually became the Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet. Under this command, the 1st Marine Division and the 1st and 9th Army Divisions received their initial training in amphibious warfare. Moving to San Diego in August 1942, the general took command of the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, under which he completed the amphibious indoctrination of the 2d and 3d Marine Divisions before they went overseas, and the 7th Army Division and other units involved in the Aleutians operation. The Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, was later redesignated the V Amphibious Corps, and in September 1943, as commander of that unit, General Smith arrived at Pearl Harbor to begin planning for the Gilbert Islands campaign. He continued to head the V Amphibious Corps until August 1944, when he was named Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, at Pearl Harbor. Subsequently, he commanded the Fleet Marine Force. In addition to that post, he commanded Task Force 56 in the Battle of Iwo Jima before returning to the United States in July 1945, to head the Marine Training and Replacement Command at Camp Pendleton, California. Holland was known for the quote \\"In our corps without responsibility and discipline we would not have won the Battle of Iwo Jima.\\" U.S. Navy Admirals Raymond Spruance and Richmond Turner wanted General Smith to command the Okinawa invasion forces. They were overruled by CinCPac, Admiral Nimitz because General Smith had sacked a U.S. Army General, Ralph Smith, during the Saipan campaign, and justifiable animosity between senior U.S. Army staff existed towards General Smith due to his service chauvinism. U.S. Army General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr. was appointed to command the Okinawa invasion in his place.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"If more magma condensation occurs, it will directly impact a step of the process of mineral formation. To understand how this perturbation will affect mineral formation, let's take a closer look at the process and how each step is involved in producing minerals. 1. Magma moves closer to the Earth's crust: The movement of magma is driven by various factors such as temperature, pressure, and the composition of the magma itself. As magma rises closer to the Earth's crust, it experiences changes in its surrounding conditions that promote the cooling and condensation process. 2. The magma starts to cool: Cooling starts as the magma comes into contact with the cooler rocks of the Earth's crust. The change in temperature causes the magma to lose heat, which aids its transition from a molten to a solid state. 3. The cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense: As the magma cools, the atoms within it lose thermal energy and begin to slow down, eventually condensing and becoming more tightly packed. At a specific temperature called the saturation temperature, the magma becomes supersaturated, which means it can no longer maintain all the dissolved minerals within it. 4. The condensed magma solidifies: Once atoms in the magma have condensed and become closely packed, they will begin to bond together and solidify, forming mineral crystals. 5. The solidified magma forms minerals: As solidification progresses, different minerals will form based on the chemical composition of the magma, its temperature, and pressure. These minerals make up the various igneous rocks that result from the solidification process. Now, suppose more magma condensation occurs. This perturbation would directly impact the process, specifically at step 3, where the cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense. The increase in condensation will lead to a higher concentration of mineral elements in the remaining magma and could potentially increase the likelihood of mineral formation. This is because more atoms are condensing together and reaching the saturation point faster, thus promoting the solidification process. With more magma condensation, we can expect that more minerals will form, as there will be a higher concentration of mineral components in the magma. Different minerals might also form by influencing factors like cooling rates and chemical composition. Additionally, the overall rate at which minerals form could be affected, as the increased condensation could lead to quicker solidification and the subsequent formation of minerals. In conclusion, an increase in magma condensation would directly impact a step of the process, specifically, the step where cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense. This perturbation can lead to the formation of more minerals and potentially impact the rate at which minerals form and the types of minerals that result from the overall process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkish pronunciation: [re'dZep taj'jip 'aerdo(W)an] ( listen); born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician serving as the current President of Turkey, holding the position since 2014. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, leading it to general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down upon his election as President in 2014. In 2001, Erdogan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdogan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yilmaz and Ciller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdogan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gul became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdogan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdogan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gul handed over the post. On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdogan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdogan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gul as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Canakkale, and one million in Izmir on 13 May. The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdogan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdogan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%. In the June 2011 elections, Erdogan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdogan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%). how long was he in power for?","completion":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been in power for a significant amount of time, with different roles throughout his political career. He served as the Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. Then, he served as the Prime Minister of Turkey from 2003 to 2014. After completing his term as Prime Minister, Erdogan was elected as the President of Turkey in 2014, a position he still holds. If we sum up his years in power, Erdogan has been in power for a total of 27 years to date (1994-1998 as Mayor, 2003-2014 as Prime Minister, and 2014-present as President).

When I was in middle school, if you didn’t have homework completed or goofed off in some way, teachers could make you stay after school for ‘after school help.’ It was essentially a mandatory study hall and if a teacher called you out, you had no choice in the matter. Now, I was in Biology class towards end of my middle school career and was sitting at one of those lab tables next to another student. We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people’s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn’t quite finish. Our teacher is working his way around the classroom checking assignments. So, he checks my lab partner, “well Scott, looks like you will be staying after school today.” This fellow student knew I didn’t have mine either, but also knew I was a pretty good student. I feel like I am sweating bullets and trembling as the teacher approaches me. In a near panic, I reach into my folder and pull out a prior week’s assignment. He looks it over and says “OK, good job” or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief. Even funnier was the fact that this week’s assignment required 6–7 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page. It was totally obvious what I had done, but our teacher gave me a break that day.

Industry 4.0 is a high-tech project, which promotes the computerization of manufacturing . The basic principle of Industry 4.0 is that by connecting machines, work pieces and systems, we are creating intelligent networks along the entire value chain that can control each other automatically. The goal is the Smart Factory, which adapts well and uses resources efficiently as well as linking customers and business partners with great intelligence. Technological basis are the Internet systems and advanced factories. Experts believe that Industry 4.0 could be a reality in about 10 to 20 years. So, what effects does this change have on the classic manufacturing? According to an expert, \\"it is highly likely that the world of production will become more and more networked until everything is connected with everything else.\\" Networks and processes have so far been limited to one factory.

The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries.

Movie title: Dolls Movie plot: Jody Bower (Carrie Lorraine) is an imaginative child on holiday with her annoying father, called David Bower (Ian Patrick Williams), a man only worried about the money of his second wife and Jody's stepmother, Rosemary (Carolyn Purdy-Gordon), a wealthy lady who finds Jody annoying. This lady is so mean that she throws Jody's teddy bear into the bushes - Jody imagines her teddy to become a huge real teddy who kills both her father and stepmother. Their car gets stuck close to a countryside house. Nobody answers when they knock the main door, but a storm breaks out, it's dark, they're lost, tired and cold, so they enter the place through a broken door.When the elderly owners of the house, Gabriel Hartwicke (Guy Rolfe) and Hilary Hartwicke (Hilary Mason), startle them. They are kind, they look like an old-fashioned marriage and they prepare dinner.There are three more people who appear that night at the mansion: two hitchhikers, Enid (Cassie Stuart) and Isabel Prange (Bunty Bailey), who are a kind of punk best friends - Isabel has the look of Madonna in her Who's That Girl? phase - and the childish man who pick them up, a kind young man called Ralph Morris (Stephen Lee). The Hardwickes say that they used to be toy makers. After dinner, they distribute everybody in different bedrooms. Isabel and Enid play loud music in their room, but Ralph is sent to another different room, and Jody is sent to her own room. Hilary gives Jody Mr Punch, a puppet-looking doll. There are weird dolls in every room.Isabel wants to steal the antiquities at the mansion, because Gabriel and Hilary they were old. Isabel is attacked, and bleeds after being pushed against the walls. We never see who the killer is.Jody sees the bloodied body. She tells her parents, but they don't pay any attention to her. She tells Ralph, who dismisses her, until he notices Jody's blood-stained slippers. He goes with Jody to check on Isabel. They don't find the body at first, but when they try to tell Enid, she panics. She blames Ralph, the same as Rosemary... The answer is:","completion":"In the movie \\"Dolls,\\" it is heavily implied that the dolls are responsible for the death of Isabel. While the killer is never explicitly shown, the film's plot and atmosphere suggest that Gabriel and Hilary Hartwicke's dolls are more than simple inanimate objects. The elderly couple's background as toy makers, along with the presence of numerous creepy dolls throughout the mansion, serve to create an eerie setting where the supernatural is entirely possible. Isabel's death is mysterious and brutal, with her being attacked and bleeding out after being pushed against the walls. This gruesome scene puts into question the real motives and nature of the Hartwickes and their collection of dolls. It also demonstrates the film's theme of deception and hidden agendas, as the seemingly innocuous dolls turn out to be malevolent. Additionally, Jody's imagination and her experience with her teddy bear, which she imagines as a real-life entity capable of killing her father and stepmother, further supports the idea that the dolls could be the ones responsible for Isabel's death. Jody's unique perspective and active imagination seem to hint at a connection between her and the supernatural occurrences taking place within the mansion. In conclusion, although the movie \\"Dolls\\" does not explicitly reveal who kills Isabel, the overall plot, tone, and character dynamics strongly suggest that the dolls themselves are responsible for her death. This supernatural twist adds to the film's suspense and horror elements, leaving audiences questioning the true nature of the seemingly innocent toy makers and their eerie collection of dolls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Set in Chicago in the 1930s, Bigger Thomas, an African American who lives in an impoverished neighborhood, is employed by a prosperous white family who live in the suburbs of a major city. The money Bigger makes at his new job will be used to supplement his mother's income. As a chauffeur, he is directed by the father of the family to take Mary, the daughter, to the university.

Ensuite, le Programme de Suivi a pour objectif de déterminer l'efficacité des mesures d'atténuation qui ont été mises en place pour minimiser les impacts négatifs d'un projet ou d'une action sur l'environnement. Ces mesures peuvent inclure diverses actions de protection de l'environnement, de gestion des ressources naturelles ou de minimisation des émissions polluantes. L'évaluation de leur efficacité permet d'ajuster ces mesures si besoin, d'en mettre en œuvre de nouvelles si nécessaire, et ainsi d'améliorer continuellement la gestion de l'impact environnemental. Le Programme de Suivi doit être conçu de manière à collecter et analyser des données pertinentes sur les impacts environnementaux et les mesures d'atténuation, et à fournir des informations utiles à toutes les parties prenantes du projet.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. and the situation: Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted.

Budget 2015: GST on the cards for overseas internet downloads GST will be imposed on internet downloads from overseas providers under the so-called Netflix tax, next week’s budget papers are expected to reveal. The assistant treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has been a long-time proponent of charging GST on films, music, books and video games downloaded from overseas providers, saying the measure “provides a level playing field” for domestic providers who are charged GST. “This is an area that we’ve been working with international partners on, trying to get a good understanding of where Australia’s tax system should be for the future,” Frydenberg told ABC TV on Thursday. “We have a growing digital and e-commerce world and the tax system needs to stay up with that game, because if we don’t, the taxpayer will be shortchanged and that won’t be a good outcome for either consumers or for taxpayers.” Tony Abbott would not be drawn on the details of the tax. He told 3AW radio on Thursday: “There are a number of these internet-based online businesses like iTunes which are paying GST in Australia. There are some, I understand, which aren’t paying GST in Australia. We will have more to say about that on budget night.” State and territory treasurers pledged their in-principle support for the integrity measures when they met the federal treasurer, Joe Hockey, in Canberra last month. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said that Labor would consider the GST proposal. A 2012 review into GST by the former NSW premier Nick Greiner and former Victorian premier John Brumby estimated that in 2010-11 the government lost 1bn in revenue by not charging the tax on intangibles. The number of downloads from overseas providers has skyrocketed since then. The government also wants to apply GST to online goods and services worth less than 1,000, although consumer groups have warned that websites might also add a fee to cover processing costs. Shorten said lowering the threshold should be considered only if revenue exceeded the cost of setting up the new system. “If you are going to bring in a new tax which goes to peoples’ cost of living and it costs more to collect than raise, it sort of defeats the purpose,” Shorten told ABC Radio on Monday. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The Australian government is planning to add a tax called GST (Goods and Services Tax) on things like movies, music, books, and video games that people download from websites in other countries.

Problem: Solve -24*c - 11*c = 12*c - 94 for c. And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the given equation -24c - 11c = 12c - 94 for c, we will first combine the like terms on both sides of the equation, and then we will isolate the variable c. Let's go step-by-step. Given equation: -24c - 11c = 12c - 94 Step 1: Combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation, we have two terms with the variable c, -24c and -11c. We can combine these terms by adding them: (-24c + (-11c)) = -24c - 11c = -35c So, the equation becomes: -35c = 12c - 94 Step 2: Isolate the variable c. To isolate c, we want to move the term with c from the right side to the left side of the equation. We can do this by adding (-12c) to each side of the equation: -35c + (-12c) = 12c - 12c - 94 -47c = -94 Now, we need to get c by itself. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of c, which is -47: -47c / -47 = -94 / -47 c = 2 And the answer is: c = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left.

Review: This is my first reading of the Stalingrad and to my most disappointment: author Anthony Beevor put his political view above such history event in the human history. I have no doubt that the author is a strong anti-communist for he display the most of the darkest side of Russian's account on the War, but such prejudice put him to the view point of the Nazis: those Russians in his description are cold-blooded running dogs, and the German soliders are proud of their professionalism and only \\"home sickness and Christmas\\".Although author has access to a lot of the most recent revealed archives on the Russia side, his bias makes such book unsuitable for any kind of serious academic references nor debates. Anyway, this would be a great book of source of information for whoever pro-Nazis, anti-Russian, and anti-communists. Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the analysis of the given product review, it is evident that the review is predominantly negative. There are several reasons to reach this conclusion, which are outlined below. 1. The title of the review itself indicates a negative perspective: \\"A political manipulation of war history than history itself.\\" This suggests that the reviewer believes the author's presentation of history is compromised by political biases, resulting in a distorted and untrustworthy portrayal of the events. 2. The reviewer explicitly expresses disappointment with the book, stating, \\"to my most disappointment.\\" This clearly indicates dissatisfaction with the author's approach and the overall quality of the work. 3. The reviewer questions the author's motives and biases, accusing him of being \\"a strong anti-communist\\" and having a prejudiced viewpoint. Such accusations imply that the reviewer doubts the credibility and objectivity of the historical account provided in the book. 4. The reviewer critiques the author's portrayal of both the Russians and the Germans in the book. They argue that the author's bias leads him to \\"the view point of the Nazis\\", presenting the Russian side in a negative light and the German side in a more favorable manner. This criticism further supports the negative tone of the review. 5. The reviewer goes on to argue that the author's bias makes the book \\"unsuitable for any kind of serious academic references nor debates.\\" This statement further reinforces the negative perspective on the book, suggesting that it is not a valuable academic resource due to the perceived bias. 6. Lastly, the reviewer offers a sarcastic remark, implying that the book would be \\"a great source of information for whoever pro-Nazis, anti-Russian, and anti-communists.\\" This final comment further cements the negative nature of the review, as the reviewer essentially argues that the book would only be suitable for those who share the author's perceived biases. In conclusion, considering the above points and the overall tone of the review, it is clear that this product review is negative. The reviewer strongly criticizes the author's objectivity, credibility, and portrayal of historical events, ultimately suggesting that the book is unsuitable for academic purposes and only serves to reinforce certain biased perspectives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky...

Simmons), Rory gets a job as a mail supervisor in a literary agency and attempts to sell his first novel, which is repeatedly rejected by publishers.After living together for some time, Rory and Dora marry and, during their honeymoon in Paris, Dora presents Rory with a gift, an old briefcase from an antiques store. Returning to America, Rory finds an old but masterfully written manuscript in the briefcase with a central character named Jack. Rory types the manuscript into his laptop. Later, while using the laptop, Dora happens upon the novel and reads it. Assuming her husband wrote it, Dora encourages him to meet with a publisher, Joseph Cutler (eljko Ivanek), who offers Rory a contract after reading the manuscript, which Rory accepts. The book is a hit and Rory becomes famous.At this point, Hammond takes a break from the reading and goes backstage, where he is introduced by his agent (John Hannah) to Daniella (Olivia Wilde), a student and amateur writer who wants to interview him and notes that he is separated from his wife, although he still wears a wedding ring. Hammond agrees to meet her after the ceremony and returns to the stage, where he continues to read the book.The second part of the reading details Rorys encounter with an unnamed old man (Jeremy Irons) in New York City's Central Park, who reveals himself as the true author of the manuscript and that it was based on his life in Paris.

Following her column about Hollywood’s influence on alleged Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger, The Post’s Ann Hornaday received swift and divided feedback on social media. Here is her response to critics. (Davin Coburn/The Washington Post) Following her column about Hollywood’s influence on alleged Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger, The Post’s Ann Hornaday received swift and divided feedback on social media. Here is her response to critics. (Davin Coburn/The Washington Post) As deranged manifestos go, the final YouTube video made by suspected Isla Vista, Calif., mass murderer Elliot Rodger was remarkably well-made. Filmed by Rodger in his black BMW, with palm trees in the background and his face bathed in magic-hour key light, the six-minute diatribe — during which he vows revenge on all the women who rejected him and men who were enjoying fun and sex while he was “rotting in loneliness” — might easily have been mistaken for a scene from one of the movies Rodger’s father, Peter Rodger, worked on as a director and cinematographer. Indeed, as important as it is to understand Rodger’s actions within the context of the mental illness he clearly suffered, it’s just as clear that his delusions were inflated, if not created, by the entertainment industry he grew up in. With his florid rhetoric of self-pity, aggression and awkwardly forced “evil laugh,” Rodger resembled a noxious cross between Christian Bale’s slick sociopath in “American Psycho,” the thwarted womanizer in James Toback’s “The Pick-Up Artist” and every Bond villain in the canon. As Rodger bemoaned his life of “loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desire” and arrogantly announced that he would now prove his own status as “the true alpha male,” he unwittingly expressed the toxic double helix of insecurity and entitlement that comprises Hollywood’s DNA. For generations, mass entertainment has been overwhelmingly controlled by white men, whose escapist fantasies so often revolve around vigilantism and sexual wish-fulfillment (often, if not always, featuring a steady through-line of casual misogyny). Rodger’s rampage may be a function of his own profound distress, but it also shows how a sexist movie monoculture can be toxic for women and men alike. How many students watch outsized frat-boy fantasies like “Neighbors” and feel, as Rodger did, unjustly shut out of college life that should be full of “sex and fun and pleasure”? How many men, raised on a steady diet of Judd Apatow comedies in which the shlubby arrested adolescent always gets the girl, find that those happy endings constantly elude them and conclude, “It’s not fair”? Movies may not reflect reality, but they powerfully condition what we desire, expect and feel we deserve from it. The myths that movies have been selling us become even more palpable at a time when spectators become their own auteurs and stars on YouTube, Instagram and Vine. If our cinematic grammar is one of violence, sexual conquest and macho swagger — thanks to male studio executives who green-light projects according to their own pathetic predilections — no one should be surprised when those impulses take luridly literal form in the culture at large. Police were examining this video posted on YouTube in which a man who identifies himself as Elliot Rodger says he is planning an attack in Isla Vista because he had been snubbed by women. Editor's note: This video contains language that some may find disturbing. (YouTube) Part of what makes cinema so potent is the way even its most outlandish characters and narratives burrow into and fuse with our own stories and identities. When the dominant medium of our age — both as art form and industrial practice — is in the hands of one gender, what may start out as harmless escapist fantasies can, through repetition and amplification, become distortions and dangerous lies. Every year, San Diego State University researcher Martha Lauzen releases a “Celluloid Ceiling” report in which she delivers distressing statistics regarding the state of women in Hollywood. This year, she found that women made up just 16 percent of directors, writers, producers, cinematographers and editors working on the top 250 movies of 2013; similarly, women accounted for just 15 percent of protagonists in those films. View Graphic The California shooter’s path Even if 51 percent of our movies were made by women, Elliot Rodger still would have been seriously ill. But it’s worth examining who gets to be represented on screen, and how. It makes sense to ask, as cartoonist Alison Bechdel does in her eponymous Bechdel Test, whether a movie features (1) at least two named female characters who (2) talk to each other about (3) something besides a man. And it bears taking a hard look at whether we’re doing more subtle damage to our psyches and society by so drastically limiting our collective imagination. As Rodger himself made so grievously clear, we’re only as strong as the stories we tell ourselves. ||||| Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow criticized Washington Post critic Ann Hornaday for writing that films such as the ones produced by Rogen and Apatow -- as well as many others -- are part of what led Elliot Rodger to kill six people near the University of California's Santa Barbara campus on May 23. \\"How many students watch outsized frat-boy fantasies like 'Neighbors' and feel, as Rodger did, unjustly shut out of college life that should be full of 'sex and fun and pleasure'?\\" Hornaday wrote, referencing the recent comedy starring Rogen. \\"How many men, raised on a steady diet of Judd Apatow comedies in which the shlubby arrested adolescent always gets the girl, find that those happy endings constantly elude them and conclude, 'It’s not fair'?\\" Hornaday, who also cited \\"American Psycho,\\" James Bond movies and \\"The Pick-Up Artist\\" in her piece, blamed \\"male studio executives\\" for promoting films that value \\"violence, sexual conquest and macho swagger.\\" \\"No one should be surprised when those impulses take luridly literal form in the culture at large,\\" she wrote. On Monday, Rogen responded to Hornaday via Twitter. .@AnnHornaday I find your article horribly insulting and misinformed. — Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) May 26, 2014 .@AnnHornaday how dare you imply that me getting girls in movies caused a lunatic to go on a rampage. — Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) May 26, 2014 Apatow, too, used social media to comment on Hornaday's piece. The tweets posted by Rogen and Apatow created lots of discussion in online circles, with Awards Daily editor Sasha Stone being one of the most vocal in her defense of Hornaday's ultimate point. \\"What Hornaday says is that misfit creeps look to movies like that, unrealistic depictions of unattractive males getting hot women, and feel even more slighted by women or society as a result,\\" Stone wrote in a lengthy piece on her site. \\"Why aren't THEY recognized? Why can't they have what that guy has? Haven't American films flipped since the 1970s to give everyone a deserved happy ending? Travis Bickle didn't get one, nor did many of the protagonists in the major motion pictures back then. But we had bizarre murders like Charles Manson and serial killers were on the rise. But mass shootings? That's a new thing. Can we look at movies as at least part of the whole culture around entitlement?\\" Stone and Apatow also discussed the issue on Twitter. UPDATE: Later on Tuesday, Hornaday released a video to comment on her piece and the critiques lobbed at her from Rogen and Apatow. \\"In singling out 'Neighbors' and Judd Apatow, I by no means meant to cast blame on those movies or Judd Apatow's work for this heinous action,\\" Hornaday said. \\"But I do think, again, it bears all of us asking what the costs are of having such a narrow range of stories that we constantly go back to. [...] As a film critic, what I wanted to do was think about what echoes we heard from the larger culture and maybe pose some questions that might be useful.\\" Watch Hornaday's full response in the video below. Apatow, meanwhile, also commented on the coverage his tweets about Hornaday received: Here is how it all works. Anne says something thoughtless. I say it is wrong then CNN asks everyone to debate and it becomes TV. — Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) May 27, 2014 I said no. I wonder if Anne can prevent herself from going on and becoming part of how these tragic events become profit centers for media — Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) May 27, 2014 To read Hornaday's op-ed, head to the Washington Post's website. Sasha Stone's editorial on the story can be found here. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the name of University of California Santa Barbara. ||||| Movie critic Ann Hornaday’s Washington Post column, linking the California gunman to Hollywood, has proven controversial. And not for the usual reasons. Her primary error was seeming to implicate the works of Judd Apatow — a move that drew the scorn of conservative writer Ed Morrissey, among others. Hornaday invites this criticism, but it would be a shame if it overshadowed her larger point: That Hollywood creates a toxic worldview that influences vulnerable and impressionable people. To be sure, Hornaday’s notion that the entertainment world’s values are an inexorable result of films being created mostly by “white men” — not the logical conclusion of films being created largely by peddlers of a consumerist and nihilistic culture — is where we part ways. White men are not, I would argue, genetically predestined to produce misogynistic or sexist (or otherwise horrific) films. But Hornaday does make a valid (and some would say courageous) point about the way movies can and do influence us. (In this case, the fact that the shooter’s father was a director and cinematographer of some consequence makes the connection a bit easier.) This may be her most important graf: Movies may not reflect reality, but they powerfully condition what we desire, expect and feel we deserve from it. The myths that movies have been selling us become even more palpable at a time when spectators become their own auteurs and stars on YouTube, Instagram and Vine. If our cinematic grammar is one of violence, sexual conquest and macho swagger — thanks to male studio executives who green-light projects according to their own pathetic predilections — no one should be surprised when those impulses take luridly literal form in the culture at large. There are, of course, a myriad of factors involved in something like this, including the availability of weapons, mental health, parental guidance, etc. Nobody serious would suggest that a perfectly well-adjusted person would see a TV show and then suddenly snap. But the notion that media cannot — does not — over the course of decades, sell a certain weltanschauung seems an absurd argument — undermined by the billions in advertising dollars spent by large companies to get us to purchase their products (and don’t get me started on product placement). If they can sell products, they can sell ideas. (In fact, they usually use the latter to sell the former; people don’t buy widgets, they buy freedom or sex or…whatever.) (The irony, of course, is that Hollywood is, as previously noted, largely run by liberals — the very people who, in many cases, make a lot of money glamorizing the very values they will later condemn if one were to act them out in real life. For more on that, see my post on Game of Thrones.) None of this, of course, is a new idea. In fact, conservative columnist Mike Adams echoes much Hornaday’s take. Both mention American Psycho, but Adams also brings in other examples, including Dexter. Citing [murderer Elliot] Rodger’s manifesto, Adams concludes that “Rodger sees himself playing the morally justified role of killing women who deserve to be killed, in his own mind.” “Although he is clearly twisted and demented at some level,” Adams continues, “TV shows like Dexter drive home the message that ‘it’s okay to kill people if they deserve it.'” The real question then becomes who decides who deserves it. It’s probably dangerous to hypothetically implicate specific movies or shows or directors. But it is, I would argue, fair to raise questions about the culture and the media industrial complex. There may very well be positive and negative externalities that come from the “products” Hollywood sells. To be sure, the vast majority of us are able to watch Breaking Bad and enjoy the complex well-produced story, without deciding to go into the meth business. We might even be inspired to grapple with some complex questions that need grappling with. I’m not suggesting we ought to run only Leave it to Beaver episodes, on the off chance that a mentally disturbed person might tune in to Hill Street Blues and go on a rampage. We shouldn’t let a deranged lunatic force us to surrender our First Amendment protections any more than we would allow him to force us to surrender the Second Amendment freedoms. But what I am suggesting that freedom comes with responsibilities, and that culture has consequences. And a culture that spends decades selling consumerism and violence shouldn’t be surprised to have to deal with the results. Ideas, as they say, have consequences. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Ann Hornaday, a film critic for The Washington Post, wrote an op-ed linking the alleged Isla Vista, California mass murderer, Elliot Rodger, to Hollywood, citing the influence of movies on his actions and worldview.

Article: According to sociologists , every modern industrial society has some form of social stratification . Class, power and status are important in deciding people's rank in society. Class means a person's economic position in society. A commonly used classification is lower class, middle class and upper class. While sociologists disagree on how these terms should be exactly defined, they do describe societies like the United States quite well. One study shows that 53% of Americans belong to the lower class, 46% the middle class, and 1% the upper class. Interestingly, a surgeon earning 500,000 a year and a bus driver earning 50,000 a year both regard themselves as the middle class! Power refers to the amount of control a person has over other people. Obviously, people in positions of great power (such as governors) exercise big power, but people who take orders from others have less power. Power and class do not always go hand in hand, however. For example, the governor of a state has great power, but he or she may not belong to a corresponding economic class. Generally, however, there is a relationship between power and class. To our knowledge, there aren't too many people who aren't millionaires in the U.S. Senate! Status is the honor or respect attached to a person's position in society. It can also be affected by power and class, but not necessarily so. For example, a university professor may have a high status but not belong to a high social class or have a lot of power over others. Question: According to the text, we know that _ .

The musical is based on Lynn Riggs' 1931 play, Green Grow the Lilacs. Set in Oklahoma Territory outside the town of Claremore in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry. A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fiancee, Ado Annie. The original production of Oklahoma! was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the New York Journal American pronounced the musical \\"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers's music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\\". In the New York Herald Tribune, Howard Barnes wrote, \\"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended.... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\\" Louis Kronenberger of PM opined that \\"Mr. Hammerstein's lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart's at their best, but the songs in Oklahoma! call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\\" In the New York Daily News, Burns Mantle declared that \\"Oklahoma! really is different - beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, Oklahoma! seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber's Show Boat\\". New York World-Telegram critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \\"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \\"Out of My Dreams\\" and \\"All Er Nuthin'\\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights.... They are spinetingling, out of this world.\\" In The New York Sun, Ward Morehouse commented that \\"Oklahoma! is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \\"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\\" Lorenz Hart himself \\"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in Sardi's restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\\" The only negative review of the musical appeared in the New York Post: The critic wrote that \\"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\\", stating that the score consisted of \\"a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\\" She concluded that the show was \\"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\\" What did critics say?","completion":"Critics were overwhelmingly positive and impressed with Oklahoma!, praising its fresh and imaginative approach to musical theater. John Anderson of the New York Journal American called it \\"a beautiful and delightful show\\" with \\"practically everything.\\" Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune commended the seamless blend of songs, dances, and a compelling story, noting that Richard Rodgers's score was one of his best and that Oscar Hammerstein II's libretto and lyrics were catchy and effective. Agnes de Mille's choreography and Rouben Mamoulian's direction also garnered acclaim, contributing to the musical's overall charm and appeal. Louis Kronenberger of PM remarked on Hammerstein's lyrics, stating that although they might lack the crispness and wit of Lorenz Hart's work, they were appropriately and enjoyably suited to the themes and setting of Oklahoma! In the New York Daily News, Burns Mantle described the musical as \\"beautifully different,\\" highlighting Rodgers's contribution and the atmospheric lyrics by Hammerstein II. Burton Rascoe of the New York World-Telegram emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that Richard Rodgers's music and Agnes de Mille's choreography were the highlights of the show, with the \\"Out of My Dreams\\" and \\"All Er Nuthin'\\" dances being particularly impactful. Ward Morehouse of The New York Sun appreciated the musical's charm and leisurely feel, noting that even Lorenz Hart, Rodgers's former collaborator, applauded the show from the audience and expressed his delight at the show's premiere. However, there was one negative review from the New York Post, which criticized the musical as being slightly too cute and that the songs tended to sound alike without much variety. Despite this, the overwhelming majority of critics lauded Oklahoma! for its innovative storytelling, captivating music, and enchanting choreography, solidifying its status as a groundbreaking and enduring work in the realm of musical theater."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Said he would 'take matters into his own hands' when he heard Miss Willis, with whom he has four children, would not be arrested over 'threats' Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Controversial Derby Fire Case: A Sordid Tale of Love, Revenge, and Betrayal The tragic fire at a Derby home that claimed the lives of six children has been the center of attention for both the public and legal authorities. As the trial unfolds, new and disturbing information continues to emerge about the accused couple – Michael and Mairead Philpott. The two, along with a third defendant, Paul Mosley, vehemently deny their involvement in this horrific crime, facing six separate counts of manslaughter. The prosecution alleges that the inferno at the Philpott's home was not a tragic accident but a calculated, cold-blooded act of revenge against Michael's ex-mistress, Lisa Willis. According to court testimony, Michael Philpott had four additional children with Willis, and the bond between the two reportedly began to sour in the weeks before the fire. At the crux of the court case lies a twisted web of love, jealousy, and betrayal. As detailed by the prosecution, the relationship between Philpott and Willis had become increasingly tumultuous, culminating in a series of chilling death threats. Witnesses in court recall Michael Philpott confiding in them about the alleged phone calls from a determined and vengeful Lisa Willis. Philpott had reportedly informed investigating officers about these persistent threats but felt unsatisfied with the perceived lack of action taken against Willis. Frustrated by what he believed to be a negligent response from law enforcement, Philpott allegedly took matters into his own hands. In the dead of night on May 11, 2012, the prosecution claims that Michael Philpott, with the assistance of his wife, Mairead, and their friend, Paul Mosley, conspired to execute a calculated and heinous act of revenge on Lisa Willis by starting the fire. The devastating fire tore through the house in just minutes, leading to the untimely deaths of the Philpott's six children – Jade, 10; John, nine; Jack, eight; Jesse, six; Jayden, five; and Duwayne, 13, for whom Mairead was the stepmother. The deliberate act of arson was, as the prosecution asserts, inextricably linked to the ongoing animosity and rage Michael Philpott and Lisa Willis shared. However, the defense tells a different story. They insist that the accusations facing Michael and Mairead Philpott and their accomplice, Paul Mosley, are nothing but the culmination of a series of unfortunate and unconnected events. With the testimonies set to continue, the trial will reveal the true nature of the relationships embroiled within this case and potentially unveil the dark secrets surrounding the fire that engulfed the Derby home and destroyed the lives of six innocent children. As the battle continues in court, the public is left to wonder if the deaths of these young children were indeed the tragic fallout of a twisted love triangle or merely the victims of an unfortunate accident. As evidence and testimonies come forth, the judge and jury must assess how much blame can be placed upon Michael and Mairead Philpott and Paul Mosley for the heartbreaking end that tore this family apart in the blink of an eye."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. and the situation: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first.

A:","completion":"In this analysis, the product review portrays a first rate Western in a predominantly flattering light, while showcasing some of its potential challenges and inherent difficulties for the main character. The description of the story as \\"realistic\\" and \\"true life\\" adds a sense of credibility and depth to the narrative, setting it apart from other typical Westerns that may be more fictionalized or glamorized. The focus on the main character's struggle to change his life and escape the constant confrontations with other gunfighters provides readers with an interesting insight into the internal and external conflicts of a person living in the old west. This portrayal suggests a more nuanced and humanizing view of the characters, which can be appreciated by an audience seeking a more grounded and mature story. Additionally, the review notes the relentless pursuit of the main character by other \\"tough\\" individuals seeking to challenge his reputation. This element not only adds tension and intrigue to the plot, but also serves as a commentary on the dangerous and often brutal lifestyle of gunfighters and those living in the old west. It gives the reader an understanding of the hardships and troubles faced by those who tried to navigate this tumultuous era, making it appealing to those who are intrigued by the grittiness and realism of historical fiction. However, one could argue that the mention of the main character's inability to fully escape his past or dodge the confrontations with other gunslingers might be seen as somewhat unflattering. This could depict the story as somewhat tragic or disheartening, which may not appeal to everyone. Nevertheless, this portrayal adds depth and complexity to the story, providing a more well-rounded experience for readers, who may appreciate the exploration of the different facets of the human condition in the context of the old west. In conclusion, this review paints a picture of a first-rate Western product that offers a realistic, engaging, and multifaceted story about the life and struggles of a gunfighter in the old west.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish...

But we both chose that love anyway. And no, it never changed our sexual orientation. That kind of stuff is for the Christian wackos. When we were young we both had affairs, but never with the opposite sex. As we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs. This story is not far fetched. However, the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me. My wife and I have been sleeping together for the last 40 years. We are still gay. End of story.
