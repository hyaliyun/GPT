Answer:","completion":"In mythology, the Greek equivalent of Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, is Hephaestus. Hephaestus is the Greek god of fire, metalworking, blacksmithing, and craftsmanship, among other things. His role in mythology is similar to that of Vulcan, who is worshipped in Roman mythology as the god of fire and the forge. Both Vulcan and Hephaestus are known for their roles as divine craftsmen and their abilities to create powerful and intricate weapons, jewelry, and other important artifacts for the gods and heroes. In ancient Greek mythology, Hephaestus is the son of the king and queen of the gods, Zeus and Hera. However, he was born with a physical disability, which has been depicted in varying ways throughout history – sometimes as a noticeable limp or as malformed legs. His imperfections set him apart from the other gods, who were often portrayed as perfect and beautiful in mythology. Out of embarrassment and anger, it is said that Hera either threw Hephaestus from Mount Olympus or that he willingly chose to leave. As a result, he was separated from the other gods and took up residence in his workshop below the earth, where he forged many powerful and impressive artifacts. Hephaestus is frequently associated with the forge and the anvil, which serve as symbols of his realm and are used to represent his mastery of the metalworking and blacksmithing arts. In addition to producing magnificent works for the gods, he is also known for creating many famous and supernatural items for mortal heroes in Greek mythology. Some of the most iconic weapons and artifacts that Hephaestus crafted include the divine armor of Achilles, the Aegis shield for Athena, and the invisible helmet for the hero Perseus. Despite his physical imperfections, Hephaestus was revered as an important god in Greece. He was a prominent figure in many Greek stories and myths and was worshipped in several major cities and sanctuaries, such as Athens, Lemnos, and the Hephaestia festival, which was held in his honor. The god was also the patron deity of blacksmiths, metallurgists, potters, and other artisans, who looked to him for inspiration, guidance, and protection in their work. In Roman mythology, Vulcan shares many similar attributes and responsibilities with his Greek counterpart. However, while their roles and natures are similar, there are slight differences in the stories and representations of the two deities. Vulcan is the son of Jupiter, the king of the gods, and Juno, the queen of the gods, and he is more prominently associated with destructive and chaotic fires, such as volcanic eruptions, compared to the more creative and artistic aspects of Hephaestus. Nevertheless, both gods are highly skilled and celebrated craftsmen who created essential tools, weapons, and artifacts for the gods and mortals alike, making them significant figures in their respective mythologies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His agent, Spoletta, arrives to report that Angelotti remains at large, but Cavaradossi has been arrested for questioning. He is brought in, and an interrogation ensues. As the painter steadfastly denies knowing anything about Angelotti's escape, Tosca's voice is heard singing a celebratory cantata elsewhere in the Palace. She enters the apartment in time to see Cavaradossi being escorted to an antechamber. All he has time to say is that she mustn't tell them anything. Scarpia then claims she can save her lover from indescribable pain if she reveals Angelotti's hiding place. She resists, but the sound of screams coming through the door eventually breaks her down, and she tells Scarpia to search the well in the garden of Cavaradossi's villa.

Sciarrone, another agent, then enters with news: there was an upset on the battlefield at Marengo, and the French are marching on Rome. Cavaradossi, unable to contain himself, gloats to Scarpia that his rule of terror will soon be at an end. This is enough for the police to consider him guilty, and they haul him away to be shot.

Given the question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"in which province islamabad is located?\\" The answer is:","completion":"Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan, is not located within any of the country's four provinces. Instead, it is situated in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). The Islamabad Capital Territory is a federally administered region that was established to serve as the capital city of Pakistan, separate from the provinces. The decision to create a new capital was made in the 1960s in order to promote national unity, as the previous capital, Karachi, was located in the province of Sindh and was considered too distant and provincial for the purposes of a federal capital. The Islamabad Capital Territory is located in the north-eastern part of Pakistan, adjacent to the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Its total area is about 906 square kilometers (350 square miles), and it encompasses the urban city of Islamabad, as well as rural areas and natural reserves. The ICT was established under the Constitution of Pakistan, and it is directly administered by the federal government. Islamabad is a planned city, and its design was carefully crafted by Greek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis. Its construction began in 1961, and the city was officially declared as the capital of Pakistan in 1966. Islamabad was chosen for its strategic location, natural beauty, and a relatively mild climate. The city is surrounded by the beautiful Margalla Hills, which form part of the Murree hills range, and it has a contemporary urban layout, well-maintained infrastructure, and numerous public parks and green spaces. The ICT is governed by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation, the Capital Development Authority, and the Islamabad Capital Territory Administration. The elected mayor heads the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation, while the Chief Commissioner oversees the ICT administration. The city's urban design is organized into various sectors and zones, each serving different purposes and providing essential services such as housing, commercial activities, and recreational spaces. In summary, although it is common for people to ask in which province Islamabad is located, the correct answer is that it is not part of any province. Instead, it is situated within the Islamabad Capital Territory and serves as the capital city of Pakistan. This unique arrangement helps ensure that the Pakistani capital remains neutral and impartial from the influence of any particular province, allowing it to more effectively fulfill its role as the seat of the federal government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Great Lakes states approve U.S. city's plan to draw water from Lake Michigan A suburban Milwaukee city won a hard-fought battle Tuesday to draw its drinking water from Lake Michigan in the first test of a compact designed to safeguard the Great Lakes region's abundant but vulnerable fresh water supply. A panel representing governors of the eight states adjoining the lakes unanimously approved a proposal from Waukesha, Wis., which is under a court order to find a solution to radium contamination of its groundwater wells. The city says the project will cost 265 million Cdn for engineering studies, pipelines and other infrastructure. Waukesha is only 27 kilometres from the lake but just outside the Great Lakes watershed. That required the city of about 72,000 to get special permission under the compact, which prohibits most diversions of water across the watershed boundary. The 2008 pact established a potential exception for communities within counties that straddle the line. Waukesha is the first to request water under that provision. \\"There are a lot of emotions and politics surrounding this issue, but voting yes — in co-operation with our Great Lakes neighbours — is the best way to conserve one of our greatest natural resources,\\" Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder said. Fear that Waukesha would set a precedent for a host of supplicants was one of the biggest obstacles in the city's quest to tap Lake Michigan, which began several years before the compact was signed. The region jealously guards access to the Great Lakes, which hold 95 per cent of the nation's surface fresh water. The Sun Belt's steady gains in population and political clout inspired Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to negotiate the pact in hopes of preventing raids from arid states. Ontario and Quebec adopted nearly identical legislation, although only the states were given legal authority to consider requests for U.S. water diversions. Ontario took issue with Waukesha's original plan and still isn't overly thrilled with the approval. \\"We remain apprehensive about any diversion by Waukesha and will continue to voice the concerns of Ontarians,\\" Jason Travers, director of Natural Resources Conservation Policy Branch for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, said in a written statement. Waukesha's initial application drew accusations of seeking more water than needed to support urban sprawl. The city won a conditional endorsement last month from another regional panel after making numerous changes. They included reducing the volume it would withdraw daily from 38.2 million litres to 31 million litres and shrinking its water service area. Waukesha said it would remove only a tiny fraction of Lake Michigan's supply and return the same amount as treated wastewater. \\"There will be virtually no net loss of water volume to the Great Lakes,\\" said Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, whose state abstained from last month's preliminary vote because of lingering concerns that he said Tuesday had been resolved. Amendments approved by the governors' representatives empower the states to enforce all provisions in the agreement with Waukesha. The Fox River flows through downtown Waukesha, Wis., but its groundwater is contaminated with radium. (John Flesher/Associated Press) Mayor Shawn Reilly said the city respected the conditions \\"and we are committed to compliance.\\" It will be at least a couple of years before Lake Michigan water begins flowing to Waukesha, he said. A Minnesota-based environmental coalition and the Sierra Club's Wisconsin chapter voiced disappointment with the governors' decision, as did Michigan's attorney general and two members of Congress. Critics said Waukesha had not exhausted other options, such as treating its groundwater for contamination. \\"Waukesha has known about elevated radium levels in their water supply for decades and has failed to act,\\" Reps. Debbie Dingell and Candice Miller of Michigan said, describing the decision as a failure for the compact that would undermine the region's water security. Other environmental groups that had opposed the plan before it was amended offered cautious support. \\"We will be strong watchdogs to ensure that the Great Lakes are protected,\\" the Alliance for the Great Lakes and the National Wildlife Federation said in a joint statement. ​In a 2013 report, the Alliance identified eight other cities near the watershed as potential suitors for Great Lakes water if Waukesha were approved, although none have announced such plans. Dan Injerd, the Illinois representative at Tuesday's meeting, said the fact that Waukesha spent a decade and millions of dollars on its bid would be a strong deterrent, showing that accessing Great Lakes water is \\"an extraordinarily difficult challenge.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about a city called Waukesha, which is near Milwaukee. They had a problem because the water under their city had something bad in it called radium. So, they asked permission to take water from a big lake called Lake Michigan. After thinking about it and making some changes, a group of people from nearby states said yes, Waukesha could take the water. But, they also made some rules that Waukesha has to follow. People had different feelings about the decision. Some were worried that many other cities would want to take water from the lake too. But others said that allowing Waukesha to have some water can actually help protect the big lake and its water for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The premise \\"It's nearly got human capabilities now\\" suggests that whatever \\"it\\" refers to has advanced to a level where its capabilities are close to those of a human. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"It's almost capable of behaving like a human\\" is likely to be true based on the given premise. One can assume that if something acquires human capabilities, it should be able to perform tasks and exhibit behaviors that are similar to humans. Human capabilities encompass a wide range of skills and abilities, including physical, cognitive, and emotional. This may include problem-solving, creativity, empathy, communication, and the capacity to learn and adapt. Let us consider an AI or a robot as the subject in question. Technological advancements have led to the development of sophisticated AI systems that are designed to mimic human behaviors and perform tasks that were once exclusively within the human domain. They can communicate using natural language, recognize and process emotions, and even learn new tasks autonomously. Assuming that the premise is referring to an advanced AI system or a robot, it is reasonable to hypothesize that it is almost capable of behaving like a human. However, it is important to note that the term \\"almost\\" indicates that there is still room for improvement. It implies that the AI or robot has not yet reached the full range of human capabilities and may still lack certain traits or skills that would make it indistinguishable from a human being. In conclusion, based on the premise \\"It's nearly got human capabilities now,\\" the hypothesis \\"It's almost capable of behaving like a human\\" is true, as the premise suggests a high level of similarity between the subject's capabilities and those of humans. However, it also implies that there are still areas where the subject falls short of being completely human-like."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Coming off a bad loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, the Jaguars looked to rebound against their division rival Indianapolis Colts. Indianapolis scored on its first possession as running back Joseph Addai ran it in from two yards out to make the score 7-0 Colts. After two touchdown runs by David Garrard and Maurice Jones-Drew, the Jaguars took the lead in the second quarter, 14-7. Their lead didn't last very long as quarterback Peyton Manning threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark, tying the game at 14 heading into halftime. The Jaguars regained the lead in the third quarter with Garrard finding tight end Marcedes Lewis for a fifteen-yard touchdown pass. Jacksonville took the lead 21-14. Once again, the Colts responded when Addai scored on a two-yard touchdown run tying the game at 21. With 2:13 left in the game, Garrard completed it to Maurice Jones-Drew for an eight-yard touchdown pass and the Jaguars took a 28-21 lead. That was enough time for 4 time MVP Peyton Manning, however as he hooked up with wide receiver Austin Collie for a one-yard touchdown that appeared as if it would send the game into overtime. The Jaguars got the ball back with 0:42 left on the clock, with the game tied. After a few short plays, the ball was at the Jacksonville 37-yard line with 0:33 left to play. Garrard then threw a deep pass to wide receiver Tiquan Underwood who caught it along the left sideline with 0:18 remaining in the game. Two plays later, kicker Josh Scobee lined up for a fifty-nine-yard field goal to win the game. Scobee's kick set a record for longest field goal in Jaguars franchise history.

Question: Who is the company owner? Movie plot title: The Count of Monte Cristo Movie plot: In 1815, Edmond DantÃ©s, Second Mate of a French merchant vessel, and his friend Fernand Mondego, representative of the shipping company, seek medical help at Elba for their ailing captain. Napoleon Bonaparte, having kept his guardians from killing the pair, exchanges his physicianâs services with Edmond for the delivery of a letter to a Monsieur Clarion. In Marseille, the company owner Morrell commends Edmond for his bravery, promoting him to captain over First Mate Danglars, who gave Edmond explicit orders not to land at Elba. Edmond states his intention to marry his girlfriend, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, whom Fernand lusts after. Fernand and Danglars inform on Edmond, concerning the letter Fernand saw Napoleon hand him, to the cityâs Magistrate, Villefort, who has Edmond arrested. Villefort prepares to exonerate Edmond until he learns the letter is addressed to his father, a Bonapartist; he burns the letter and orders Edmond locked up in ChÃ¢teau d'If. Edmond escapes, and turns to Fernand for help, but Fernand holds him up and turns him over to the pursuing gendarmes. Edmond is consigned to the island prison and its sadistic warden, Armand Dorleac.

To where do apple trees drop their fruit? - the ground - outside - park - ground - uzbekistan The best answer is A:","completion":"Apple trees, scientifically known as Malus domestica, drop their fruit primarily to the ground surrounding the tree. This natural process occurs when the fruit ripens and detaches from the tree, eventually succumbing to gravity and falling towards the Earth. However, the specific location where apple trees drop their fruit can vary depending on several factors. Firstly, apple trees are commonly found in orchards, gardens, or cultivated landscapes where these trees are purposefully planted and cultivated for their fruit. In these settings, the fruit will typically fall on the ground within the confines of the cultivated area. Orchard owners and gardeners often place nets or other collection devices beneath the trees to catch the apples and minimize bruising or damage to the fruit from the impact with the ground. Secondly, apple trees can also be found outside in parks or public spaces, where they have either been planted deliberately as a source of food and enjoyment for the public or have grown wild due to the dispersal of seeds by birds and other animals. In these cases, the fruit will fall on the ground, grass, or pathways within the park. This, in turn, provides an opportunity for passersby to collect and enjoy the fallen fruit, or for animals such as deer, squirrels, and birds to feast on the nutritious apples. Lastly, it is essential to mention that apple trees are not native to Uzbekistan. While Uzbekistan has a favorable climate for fruit cultivation, including grapes, apricots, and melons, apple trees are less likely to be encountered in this Central Asian country. However, it is still possible to find apple trees in private gardens, small orchards, or urban green spaces throughout Uzbekistan, and just like in any other location, the fallen apples can be found lying on the ground surrounding these trees. In conclusion, the best answer to where apple trees drop their fruit is \\"the ground,\\" given that it is the most common and natural surface upon which apples fall. However, the specific location and setting in which the apple trees are found (e.g., orchards, gardens, parks) may also provide additional context to the question and insights into where the tree's fruit can be found."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: suppose there are fewer predators happens, how will it affect fewer eggs will hatch. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If there are fewer predators in the environment, it is likely that more eggs will survive and hatch due to the decreased risk of being consumed by predators. This survival rate increase will result in a larger population of caterpillars in the early stages of their life cycle. However, the specific question seems to ask about the second effect mentioned, which is \\"the egg hatches.\\" In this context, the hatching of the eggs does not directly correlate with the number of predators. The more important factor affecting the hatching of the eggs is the environmental conditions, which include temperature, humidity, and the availability of suitable plants for the eggs to be laid on. If the reduced number of predators leads to a healthier ecosystem and better environmental conditions for the eggs, then this change could potentially have a positive, or more, effect on the number of eggs that hatch. However, we should also consider the possible consequences of the increased number of successfully hatched eggs. While the environment might be sustainable for a certain number of caterpillars, an overpopulation could lead to increased competition for food resources. This competition could subsequently result in a detrimental effect on the growth of caterpillars as they may struggle to eat enough to reach their full length. This could, in turn, hinder their ability to form into a pupa, undergoing metamorphosis, and ultimately becoming a butterfly. Additionally, the increased number of caterpillars in the ecosystem might further lead to an imbalance in its food chain, putting additional pressure on plants as the primary food source for caterpillars. This might detrimentally affect the ecosystem, and in the long run, potentially lead to a decline in the number of butterflies that can successfully reach adulthood and fly away. In conclusion, while a decrease in predators could initially result in more eggs hatching due to their enhanced chances of survival, the butterfly population's long-term sustainability depends on various factors, including healthy ecological balance and competition for resources. This perturbation could have both positive and negative effects on different aspects of the butterfly's life cycle, making it difficult to conclusively determine whether the second effect mentioned - the egg hatching - will experience more, less, or no effect from the reduced predator numbers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was the bassist for the band Long Beach Shortbus which was composed of several members of Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime . Since 2009 , Wilson has been the bassist for Sublime with Rome , a reunited version of Sublime with a new singer . - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums).

Might be time to book a vacation to Antarctica. USA Today reports the Antarctic continent hit a record high temperature of 63.5 degrees on March 24, 2015. The World Meteorological Organization announced the record Wednesday (it can take years to verify record temperatures). The previous high temperature in Antarctica was 59 degrees in 1974. Antarctica's new high temperature was measured at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula, according to Reuters. Scientists are tracking high temperatures around the continent because the melting of Antarctic ice could significantly raise sea levels around the world. Expand this summary.","completion":"Looking for a break from chilly winter weather? It might be time to consider booking a vacation to Antarctica, a destination that has recently been experiencing surprisingly warmer temperatures. In fact, on March 24, 2015, the continent reached a record high temperature of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit, as reported by USA Today. This unprecedented temperature spike was officially announced by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) on Wednesday, after thorough verification processes that can take several years to complete. The previous highest temperature recorded in Antarctica was 59 degrees back in 1974, which means that the newest record high marks a significant increase of 4.5 degrees. This record-setting temperature was measured at Argentina's Esperanza Base, which is located on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. It is important to note that climate scientists and researchers are closely monitoring these high temperatures around the continent, as they hold significant implications for the environment. The melting of Antarctic ice due to increased temperatures has the potential to raise sea levels worldwide considerably, posing a threat to coastal areas and leading to significant consequences for marine life, ecosystems, and human populations. The rise in Antarctic temperatures can be linked to global warming caused by human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These actions have led to significant increases in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere, trapping heat around the planet. As scientists continue to track temperature changes in Antarctica, they are also studying the effects of melting ice on sea levels, glacier dynamics, and the surrounding ecosystem. The loss of ice not only contributes to rising sea levels but also disrupts the habitats of numerous species native to Antarctica, such as penguins, seals, and various types of marine life. Moreover, the melting ice sheets have the potential to change ocean currents and disrupt weather patterns, leading to further climatic changes globally. In response to this concerning situation, many researchers and advocacy groups are calling for stronger global actions to mitigate climate change. This includes transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, improving energy efficiency in buildings and transportation systems, and preserving and restoring forests to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. While booking a vacation to Antarctica might seem like an exciting escape from cold winter weather, it is essential that travelers and the global community remain aware of the implications of these record high temperatures. Indeed, they serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need to address climate change and work towards a more sustainable future for our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:You are given a new situation: During the summer Anthony found it was way too hot to be comfortable. He went out to his garage to get an old fan. The fan was spins on a metal bearing but because it is old it was slightly rusted. When he turned the fan on it spun very slow, struggling to move. He then decided to lubricate the bearing that rotates the fan blades and the fan started spinning normally. and a hint : All machines make work easier, but they don’t increase the amount of work that is done. You can never get more work out of a machine than you put into it. In fact, a machine always does less work on an object than the user does on the machine. That’s because a machine must use some of the work put into it to overcome friction. Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. All machines involve motion, so they all have friction. How much work is needed to overcome friction in a machine depends on the machine’s efficiency. Please answer this question : Will reducing the friction in a machine make the machine require more or less work? A:","completion":"Reducing the friction in a machine will make the machine require less work. Step 1: Understand the problem In this situation, Anthony's fan has a rusted metal bearing, causing it to struggle to spin due to friction. The hint provided states that work put into a machine must also overcome the friction that opposes the motion of the machine. Step 2: Identifying the impact of friction on work Friction is the force that opposes motion between touching surfaces. In Anthony's fan, the rust on the metal bearing increased the friction, causing it to operate inefficiently and spin slower. Step 3: Consider the effect of lubrication When Anthony lubricates the bearing, he is reducing the friction between the metal surfaces, allowing the fan blades to rotate more freely. Step 4: Analyzing the relationship between friction and work As friction is reduced (in this case, by lubrication), the amount of work needed to overcome the friction is decreased. This means that the machine can operate more efficiently, as less work is being used to overcome friction and more work is being used for the intended purpose (spinning the fan blades). Conclusion: Reducing the friction in a machine, like Anthony's fan, will make the machine require less work, as it becomes more efficient by needing less work to overcome the friction between the moving parts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You could toss it in a vibrant vinaigrette and serve it alongside grilled meats, or stir in a handful of fresh herbs for a refreshing, fiber-packed lunch option. Amaranth's unique texture also makes it a superb addition to salads, offering a pleasing crunch that complements an assortment of vegetables and grains. Also, like traditional grains such as rice and pasta, amaranth can be cooked, cooled, and then used as the base for a cold salad. For instance, you could combine cooled amaranth with diced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, olives, and crumbled feta for a Mediterranean flair. For breakfast, you could even cook amaranth in milk and sweeten it with honey or brown sugar, making a pseudo-cereal or smoothie bowl. Topped with fresh fruits, nuts, and seeds, this forms a power-packed start to your day. Amaranth can also be popped like popcorn and served as a fun, nutritious snack. Simply heat the seeds in a covered pan until they pop, and then season them with your choice of spices. In terms of baking, amaranth flour adds a wonderful texture to cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. When mixed with other flours, it also adds a nutritive value to your baking products. Given its diverse nature, amaranth is a highly versatile grain and offers a lot of room for experimentation in the kitchen. Finally, always remember that properly storing amaranth in a cool, dry place is essential to retaining its freshness and nutritional value. By using this versatile grain in your cooking, you will not only be adding variety to your meals, but you will also enhance your diet with a nutrient-rich food that is filled with fiber, protein, and a range of important minerals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock says he has been told his side should appeal more for penalties, describing his players as \\"too honest\\".","completion":"Title: Crystal Palace Manager Neil Warnock Calls for More Appeals for Penalties, Praises Players for Honesty Introduction: Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock recently expressed his opinion on his side's approach towards penalties in football matches. While praising his players' honesty, Warnock mentioned that they should appeal more for penalties. Step 1: Describe the context of Warnock's statement During a recent interview, Neil Warnock, who is known for his no-nonsense approach and candid demeanor in dealing with the media, made a statement about the performance of his Crystal Palace side in terms of appealing penalties. He expressed his concern that his players might be losing out on potential penalty opportunities due to their honest nature. Step 2: Explain the term \\"too honest\\" in the context of football penalties In football, there are instances when a player may initiate or exaggerate contact with an opponent in order to win a penalty. This act is often frowned upon by fans and pundits alike as it is deemed dishonest. Warnock's description of his players as \\"too honest\\" implies that they do not engage in such tactics and may miss out on opportunities for penalties as a result. Step 3: Discuss the implications of Warnock's suggestion on the team's performance and overall match strategy A team's approach to winning penalties can have a significant impact on their overall match strategy and performance. By appealing more for penalties, Crystal Palace players might be able to force referees to make decisions, potentially leading to more penalty opportunities and improved chances of scoring. In close matches, these decisions can often be the deciding factor between winning and losing. Step 4: Highlight the pros and cons of adopting Warnock's suggestion On one hand, adopting Warnock's suggestion to appeal more for penalties can potentially result in increased chances for the team to score goals and consequently win matches. Apart from the obvious advantage of scoring more goals, this approach may also lead to increased confidence among the players and more aggressive gameplay. On the other hand, the act of exaggerating contact or initiating fouls for penalties is generally considered dishonest and unsportsmanlike. This may not only tarnish the reputation of the team, but also put them at risk of facing sanctions such as fines or suspensions from football governing bodies. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that increased appeals will translate into more penalties awarded, as referees might become more cautious in making decisions. Conclusion: While Neil Warnock's suggestion to appeal more for penalties could potentially improve Crystal Palace's chances of scoring and winning matches, the cost to the team's reputation and fairness may be too great. Ultimately, it remains the responsibility of the manager and the players to balance the urgency for victory with the principles of sportsmanship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Wrestlers, priceRange = less than £20, customer rating = low, familyFriendly = no Sentence:","completion":"The restaurant, aptly termed as The Wrestlers, carries with it an ambiance distinctly unique though sadly it is not family-friendly, which might tone down its appeal. The price range of the offerings on its menu positions it as a budget-friendly joint with meals counting less than £20, hence making it a potential point of attraction for students, young professionals or those looking for an inexpensive gastronomic adventure. Nevertheless, what drags it down substantially is its less than impressive customer ratings implying that the quality of service or food might not be up to par and therefore, caution might be employed before finalizing it as a dining destination. A low customer rating often paints a picture of unsatisfactory experiences such as delayed service, less-than-adequate hygiene, or food quality that fails to match up to the expectations of the venturing clientele. Therefore, while The Wrestlers may be easy on the pocket, potential patrons need to weigh their excitement for inexpensive meals against the possibility of a less than stellar dining experience. In spite of this, one might argue that every place has room for improvement, and this holds true for The Wrestlers as well. Perhaps, in time, with increased attention to customer feedback and concentrated efforts directed towards service improvement, it can ace the list as not just a budget restaurant but a preferred dining destination as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Heroes of Our Time A good heart Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa among great poverty and disease. He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine--but Coach John Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea. Dikembe became a star in the NBA, and a citizen of the United States. But he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty to share his fortune with others. He built a new hospital in his old hometown in the Congo. A friend has said of this goodhearted man: \\" Mutombo believes that God has given him this chance to do great things.\\" Success and kindness After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child. So she borrowed some equipment, and began filming children's videos in her own house. The Baby Einstein Company was born, and in just five years her business grew to more than 20 million in sales. And she is using her success to help others--producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her new program: \\" I believe it's the most important thing that I have ever done. I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe.\\" Bravery and courage A few weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlen subway station with his two little girls when he saw a man fall into the path of a train.

What is the difference between virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Options: [i] no; [ii] yes;","completion":"[i] no; While the two questions seem similar, they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks specifically about the differences between virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR), while the second question explores the differences between three related but different technologies: virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). To address both questions, let's explore each technology individually and their differences: 1. Virtual Reality (VR): Virtual reality creates a completely computer-generated environment, immersing the user in a virtual world separate from the real world. Users wear a VR headset or head-mounted display (HMD) and often use controllers or other peripherals to interact with the virtual environment. VR can create entirely unique experiences unrelated to the user's physical surroundings, and it is commonly used in gaming, simulations, and training programs. 2. Augmented Reality (AR): Augmented reality overlays digital or virtual information onto the user's real-world environment. For example, a user might see text, images, or 3D models superimposed onto their physical surroundings through their smartphone screen or AR glasses. AR aims to enhance the real world with additional information, rather than replacing the user's surroundings. Some popular applications of AR include smartphone apps for navigation, gaming, and education. 3. Mixed Reality (MR): Mixed reality, also referred to as hybrid reality, combines elements of both VR and AR. It creates a blend of physical and digital content, allowing the virtual and real-world objects to interact. MR-enabled devices commonly use cameras and sensors to track the real-world environment, allowing virtual objects to be displayed and manipulated in the user's space. Mixed reality experiences can range from primarily real-world environments with some virtual elements to primarily virtual environments with some real-world interaction. MR has potential for numerous applications, from entertainment and gaming to collaboration and engineering. Now, let's summarize the differences: - The first question asks about the difference between VR and MR. Virtual reality is a fully immersive environment disconnected from the real world, while mixed reality combines real and virtual elements in the same environment, allowing for more interaction between digital and physical objects. - The second question involves all three technologies. In summary, virtual reality immerses users in a completely computer-generated environment, augmented reality overlays digital information on the real world, and mixed reality combines aspects of both VR and AR, blending the physical and digital environments. Conclusively, although the questions address related issues, they are not paraphrases of each other because they focus on different comparisons within the realms of VR, AR, and MR."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Do Haredi Jews tend to have large or small families?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"Do Haredi Jews tend to have large or small families?\\" This statement substantiates that Haredi Jews usually have large families. The sentence prominently highlights the family size of Haredi Jews, a particular Jewish Orthodox group known for their stringent observance of Jewish religious laws and traditions. The use of the term \\"extremely large\\" is significant because it implies a family size that greatly exceeds the norm or average, suggesting not just more than two or three children, but potentially many more. There are many social, cultural, and religious reasons behind this tendency. One primary factor is the strong emphasis on the principle of procreation in Haredi Jewish culture, which encourages families to have as many children as possible. This is not only seen as the fulfilment of a religious obligation but also as a way of strengthening their community. Additional factors can include a lack of birth control, cultural norms, and the role of family in their community. Additionally, the word \\"often\\" in the sentence is critical. It doesn't imply that this is the case with all Haredi Jews, but it suggests that it is a common pattern or trend within this group. However, it is also important to remember that while a sentence can be generally accurate, there will always be exceptions to any generalization. Finally, the term \\"noteworthy\\" suggests that this trend is distinctive or striking, something that stands out when studying or observing Haredi Jewish families. It might also imply that this pattern contradicts what is typical or expected in other societies or cultures, highlighting the notable differences between the familial norms of Haredi Jews and other societal groups. In conclusion, it's not only that the sentence provides a valid answer, but it also puts the answer in a specific context related to the particular cultural and religious practices of the Haredi Jews."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: America's painful doctor shortage is threatening health care reform By Shawn Tully, senior editor-at-large FORTUNE -- The new federal budget, unveiled on Tue., March 4, trumpets a major shift in America's policy toward one of the most vexing problems in reforming our health care system: fixing the doctor shortage. Since 1997, the number of physicians entering the workforce each year has essentially been capped, while the demand for everything from hip replacements to treatments for diabetes to angioplasties has soared with our growing and aging population. Now, the Obama administration proposes spending an additional 5.23 billion over the next decade to mint new physicians. That sounds like a lot of money, and the proposal sounds like a big deal, because it officially breaks the old bottleneck that limits the supply of manpower we desperately need. But it doesn't go nearly far enough. The proposal is designed to swell the ranks of primary care doctors. Those family physicians, general internists, and pediatricians constitute the workforce that, far more than any other type of physician, is charged with making Obamacare -- and the general shift from fee-for-service to managing giant populations of patients at reduced cost -- the new paradigm for health care delivery. Unfortunately, the new policy is a timid response to a looming crisis. Based on current demographic trends alone, today's dearth of primary care practitioners is destined to get far worse. As a result, prices are rising, and competition is falling, as big hospital groups rush to hire all the primary care doctors they can find. Once one or two big chains control most of the family doctors and general internists in their markets, rivals can't find the troops to challenge them. That's creating oligopolies in markets across the nation. \\"The game today is, 'He who gets the most primary care doctors wins,'\\" says Travis Singleton, executive vice president of Merritt Hawkins, the nation's largest physician recruiting firm, and a division of AMN Healthcare (AHS). MORE: How one hospital is thriving in the age of Obamacare Because the shortage is so deep and the investment so modest -- a little more than 500 million a year -- the new measure fails to reverse the policy that caused the problem in the first place. The flow of doctors entering the market each year is determined by the number of U.S. residency positions, chiefly in teaching hospitals. Those positions are funded primarily by the program that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. In 1997, the federal government essentially froze spending on residency slots, limiting the number to around 100,000 over three-to-four years, and in turn freezing the number of newly licensed physicians available for hire each year to around 26,000. Over the past 17 years, a few hospitals have established new residency programs for primary care doctors, raising the number to around 27,000, or a less than 4% increase. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has risen by 50 million, or almost 20%. Of those new doctors, only around one-quarter, or 7,000 a year, enter primary care. The reason is obvious: Family doctors earn salaries averaging 185,000 a year, vs. 336,000 for general surgeons and 266,000 for OB/GYNs, according to Merritt Hawkins. But those relatively few family doctors, general internists, and pediatricians are in incredibly high demand. At Merritt Hawkins, the searches for family doctors far exceeds those for any other category. The American Association of Medical Colleges estimates that the U.S. will face a shortage of 46,000 primary care doctors by 2020, equivalent to one-quarter of everyone practicing in that category today. And even though the total number of doctors has risen slightly over the past decade, the total hours they work each week has actually declined, and keeps dropping, as more and more physicians collect paychecks from hospitals and large medical groups. And while it's well known that rural communities are in desperate need for more primary care practitioners, the problem is universal: Around 50% of Merritt Hawkins' searches for PCs are in towns and cities with populations exceeding 100,000. MORE: The hidden number key to Obamacare's success To fulfill the needs of the marketplace, the American Association of Medical Colleges has long advocated creating 12 new medical schools and increasing enrollment by 30% -- a shift that would eventually create an additional 8,000 doctors a year. Once again, the cap on residency slots renders that plan impossible. Indeed, the current proposal falls far short of the AAMC recommendation. The new budget would create a total of 1,300 new residency slots, all for primary care. It would also allocate almost 4 billion over 10 years to grow the National Health Service Corps, an organization that provides loan forgiveness and scholarships to doctors who work in underserved areas for three to five years after graduation. \\"Keep in mind that this proposal does not create 1,300 new doctors a year,\\" says Dr Richard Cooper, an expert on physician supply issues. \\"Those slots are divided over more than three years, so that's about 400 slots a year.\\" Hence, the total addition to the doctor workforce will amount to about 400 new doctors annually, or an increase of 1.5%. That figure might not seem so insignificant if physician assistants and nurse practitioners could fill the gap. But that won't happen. All told, those two categories of advanced practitioners encompass around 200,000. The total is growing, but the number practicing primary care is actually declining. Once again, both the NPs and PAs are in extremely short supply; Merritt Hawkins searches for the two professions jumped 164% from 2011 to 2013. MORE: My afternoon with Imelda Marcos Above all, health care reform needs basic, primary care to succeed as planned. Even before the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the market was moving decisively towards a model called Population Health Management. Instead of relying on fee-for-service, those plans provide coverage for many thousands of patients in a community or city, and require that doctors and hospitals work together in teams to manage the patients' overall care, eliminating unnecessary procedures, and ordering tests and referrals to specialists only when needed. Obamacare hastened the trend by advocating so-called accountable care organizations (ACOs) -- giant, integrated groups of physician practices and hospitals that meet a long list of requirements established by Medicare, including expertise in compiling electronic medical records, following clinical protocols for diabetes or cardiac patients, and most of all, assigning each patient a family doctor or internist to coordinate all care and handle referrals to specialists. The primary care practitioner is hence the essential \\"raw material\\" for the new medical industry. If oil or grain is in short supply, the food or energy markets will fail to function. It's the same story in health care. The ACO regulations require that each provider cover a population of at least 5,000 patients. The need for broad size and scope has led to a flood of mergers among hospitals. Last year, Merritt Hawkins performed 64% of its searches for doctors who work in hospitals, on a salary, compared to 11% in 2004. It does another 16% of its recruiting for large medical groups, where physicians also get a paycheck. \\"Hospitals are trying to buy every physician group they can, they want to hire 30 or 40 primary care doctors at a time,\\" says Singleton. MORE: Why Republicans are giving in to get ahead The wave of mergers is creating high levels of concentration in many markets, for both hospital and physician services. \\"Hospitals are acquiring physician practices to enhance their pricing power,\\" says Robert Town, a professor at the Wharton School. \\"It's clear that if you hire most of few primary care doctors available, it enhances pricing power even more.\\" Kaiser Permanente in California, and Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City are just two examples of providers with powerful networks and huge market shares. The recent merger of Baylor Health Care and physician group Scott & White could reduce the bargaining clout of companies and insurers in the Texas market. In a recent survey, Merritt Hawkins finds that waiting time to see most practitioners hasn't changed much recently. But it's still substantial -- an average of 18.5 days for a new patient to visit a doctor in 15 of America's biggest cities. As the doctor shortage gets worse, so will those waiting times. Most of all, the shortage of primary care doctors poses a fundamental economic problem. When supply is short, and demand strong -- and no one denies that Obamacare's generous subsidies will make it far stronger -- market prices rise. Increasingly, Medicare and Medicaid set reimbursement rates at rates far below the \\"market clearing\\" levels that ensure patients get full access to care. As a result, 55% of all doctors refuse Medicaid beneficiaries, up from 45% in 2009, and a full one-quarter won't see Medicare patients. The solution is far more funding for residency positions, and licensing of highly qualified doctors who've completed programs in other nations and want to work in the U.S. Hospitals that want to train more primary care doctors at their own or the future doctor's expense should be encouraged to do so. The reigning concept contradicts itself: providing universal health care while limiting the essential personnel needed to provide it. Without fixing the doctor shortage, reforming the health care system is a fantasy. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article discusses the doctor shortage in America and its impact on health care reform. Some of the most important parts are: 1. The Obama administration proposes spending an additional 5.23 billion over the next decade to train new physicians, aiming to address the doctor shortage that has been an issue since 1997. 2. The proposal is designed to increase the number of primary care doctors, a workforce crucial to the implementation of Obamacare and the shift from fee-for-service to managing large populations of patients at reduced cost. 3.

Eurosta is a genus of the family Tephritidae , known as fruit flies in North America and Picture wing flies in Europe . Eurosta is a species of the Tephritidae family , known in North America as fruit flies and wing flies in Europe . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Let's analyze the sentences step-by-step: Both sentences mention: 1. Eurosta 2. Tephritidae family 3. Known in North America as fruit flies 4. Known in Europe The differences lie in the way these terms are organized within the sentences: Sentence 1: \\"Eurosta is a genus of the family Tephritidae, known as fruit flies in North America and Picture wing flies in Europe.\\" In this sentence, Eurosta is defined as a genus belonging to the Tephritidae family. The family is known as fruit flies in North America and Picture wing flies in Europe. Sentence 2: \\"Eurosta is a species of the Tephritidae family, known in North America as fruit flies and wing flies in Europe.\\" Here, Eurosta is defined as a species within the Tephritidae family. The family is known as fruit flies in North America and wing flies in Europe. However, it's worth noting that the term \\"Picture wing flies\\" from Sentence 1 is reduced to just \\"wing flies\\" in Sentence 2, which might convey a slightly different meaning. So, these sentences do not mean exactly the same thing because they classify Eurosta differently: as a genus in Sentence 1 and as a species in Sentence 2. The common names provided for Europe also slightly differ between the two sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Choices: 1). unacceptable. 2). acceptable.","completion":"1). unacceptable. The given sentence, \\"John is easy to please and to love Mary,\\" is linguistically unacceptable. The main reason for this judgment is the ambiguity and structure of the sentence, which can lead to confusion for the reader or listener. In the sentence, the main subject is \\"John.\\" The verbs that describe what John is easy to do are \\"please\\" and \\"love.\\" However, the introduction of a second subject, \\"Mary,\\" without proper conjunction or preposition disrupts the parallelism and leads to ambiguity in the sentence. According to the sentence's structure, it seems that John is easy to please, and there is also an intended meaning that John is easy to love. However, the placement of \\"Mary\\" at the end of the sentence suggests that John is easy to love Mary, which doesn't provide a clear and coherent meaning. It would be more appropriate to reconstruct the sentence to avoid confusion and ensure linguistic acceptability. To revise the sentence based on its intended meaning, there are a couple of alternative, linguistically acceptable ways to express the same idea: 1. John is easy to please, and it is easy to love Mary. In this alternative, we have maintained the two subjects, \\"John\\" and \\"Mary.\\" The verbs \\"please\\" and \\"love\\" are now associated with the subjects individually, and the use of a proper conjunction (\\"and\\") ensures better clarity for the reader. 2. John and Mary are easy to please and to love. This alternative combines the subjects \\"John\\" and \\"Mary\\" and presents them as a unit. As a result, the verbs \\"please\\" and \\"love\\" are now applicable to both subjects, creating a more straightforward sentence structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While working on American Express , Espuelas worked on the accounts Wunderman , General Foods Gevalia and Weight Watchers . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"No, these sentences do not mean the same thing. They have subtle differences in their meaning and structure. Let's break down each sentence to make it more clear: Sentence 1: \\"While at Wunderman, Espuelas worked on the American Express, General Foods Gevalia, and Weight Watchers accounts.\\" This sentence indicates that Espuelas was working at the company Wunderman. While being employed there, Espuelas worked on three different accounts: American Express, General Foods Gevalia, and Weight Watchers. This sentence suggests that Wunderman is the company that Espuelas was working for while handling these accounts. Sentence 2: \\"While working on American Express, Espuelas worked on the accounts Wunderman, General Foods Gevalia, and Weight Watchers.\\" This sentence suggests that Espuelas was working on the American Express account first, and then during that same period, was also working on three more accounts: Wunderman, General Foods Gevalia, and Weight Watchers. In this sentence, it is not clear if Espuelas was employed by Wunderman or if it was just another account that Espuelas was working on. In summary, the meanings of the sentences are different in terms of employment and the priority or timing of the accounts Espuelas was working on. Sentence 1 implies that Espuelas worked for Wunderman and was handling the mentioned accounts within that company. Sentence 2 suggests that Espuelas was working on the American Express account, and during that time, also worked on three other accounts, with Wunderman being one of the accounts, not necessarily the employer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - hang in closet - sniff - get dirty - become soiled - air out The answer is \\"air out\\" because Answer:","completion":"The ideal solution for clothes that have developed a smell but are unable to be washed promptly is airing them out. Here's why: First and foremost, airing out clothes is an effective way to eliminate sweat, smoke, cooking odors, and other smells that your clothing might have absorbed. This is because, when you expose your clothes to the fresh air, specifically outdoors, the air circulates through the tissues of your clothing, eliminating the odor trapped in there, and replaces it with a fresh, natural scent. Airing out clothes essentially deodorizes them, without needing to put them through a wash cycle. In contrast, the other options that you proposed are less effective. Hanging your smelly clothes in the closet doesn't actually solve the problem. It simply masks it temporarily and might even spread the smell to other clothes in the closet, as there is little fresh air in the closet to help dissipate the odor. Moreover, the confined space would only serve to concentrate the smell, making it more potent over time. Sniffing the clothes may seem like a strange option, as it doesn't directly address or remove the smell in any way. Sniffing will only confirm that the clothes do indeed smell. The options of \\"get dirty\\" and \\"become soiled\\" are also not feasible solutions. Making the clothes even dirtier or more soiled in order to mask the smell won't eliminate the underlying issue, and could potentially create a new, even more unfavorable, odor. Lastly, washing is the best way to completely clean your clothes and get rid of all types of odors, but sometimes it might not be immediately possible due to lack of time, broken washing machine, water shortage or too delicate fabric. During these times, airing out clothes, especially in an open and sunlit space, is a safe, convenient, and practical solution. The UV rays from the sun also have a natural disinfecting property, helping to kill bacteria that could contribute to the development of a smell. Therefore, among these options, airing out your clothes is the most effective method to eliminate unpleasant odors when washing is not an immediate option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems - Question: suppose there is less damange by acid rain happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"If there is less damage by acid rain, it is likely to have a lessened impact on the overall consequences of the acid rain, including the second effect mentioned, which is the absorption of aluminum from the soil. However, it is important to understand the entire chain of events and how each part of the ecosystem would be affected by such a perturbation. To reiterate the process: 1. Acid rain makes waters acidic. 2. Acidic waters cause aluminum to be absorbed from the soil. 3. The water, now containing aluminum, runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc. 4. Fish and their eggs die due to increased aluminum content in the water. 5. Frogs, which rely on these aquatic life forms for food, die. 6. Plants die due to the lack of nutrients from the soil and polluted waters. 7. Insects and other wildlife reliant on these plants die. 8. The ecosystem's balance is disrupted, which may lead to further problems. Now, let's consider the scenario where the damage from acid rain is reduced. This could be due to stricter regulations on air pollution, reduction in fossil fuel consumption, or simply a reduction in the amount of nitrogen and sulfur being emitted into the atmosphere. With less acid rain, the waters would be less acidic, meaning less aluminum would be absorbed from the soil. As a result of this reduction in aluminum absorption, there would be a direct effect on the second event (and the following events) in the process: - The water running off into lakes and streams would have lower aluminum levels, which would be less harmful to fish and their eggs. This would consequently mean a higher survival rate for the fish. - With more fish surviving, the predator-prey balance between frogs and fish would be more stable, leading to fewer frogs dying. - The healthier aquatic ecosystem might positively affect plants, due to the interdependence of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. A reduction in aluminum-absorbing waters could also mean that plants have access to better-quality water and are less likely to die. - As the plant population remains stable or grows, the insects and other wildlife that depend on them would continue to thrive, leading to an overall healthier ecosystem. In conclusion, if there is less damage caused by acid rain, it would lead to a reduced effect on the absorption of aluminum from the soil. This, in turn, would have a cascading effect of mitigating the other negative consequences throughout the ecosystem, ultimately making it less vulnerable to damage caused by acid rain."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It draws its inspiration from the 2009 documentary titled \\"The Man Who Would Be Polka King,\\" which was directed by Joshua Brown and John Mikulak. The documentary explores the life of Jan Lewan, a Polish-American musician, songwriter, and band leader who became famous for his polka music in the United States. Jan Lewan's story is a fascinating one, as it not only involves his rise to fame in the world of polka music but also his involvement in a major financial scam. He created a Ponzi scheme, defrauding people by soliciting investments in his music business and offering high returns. His criminal activities ultimately led to his arrest and a prison sentence. The film adaptation, The Polka King, stars Jack Black as Jan Lewan and showcases the events and experiences that shaped Lewan's life.

In Sentence 1, \\"A channel is typically what you rent from a telephone company,\\" the term \\"channel\\" refers to a dedicated communication line that allows the transmission of voice, data, or video signals over a network. When renting a channel from a telephone company, they allot a specific bandwidth and connection path for the consumer to utilize, ensuring dedicated and reliable communication between the two communicating parties. Channels established by telephone companies are used for various purposes, including business communication, home phone connections, and internet service provisions over digital subscriber lines (DSL). In Sentence 2, \\"The channel is created by bonding the signals from these four pairs,\\" the term \\"channel\\" refers to a data transmission path formed by combining multiple signals or channels into a single, higher-capacity channel. This process, called \\"channel bonding\\" or \\"link aggregation,\\" involves taking multiple wired pairs (often Ethernet or DSL connections) and joining them to increase the overall data transfer rate. The resulting channel created by bonding the signals from these pairs facilitates faster communication and improved connectivity, particularly for the transmission of large data packets in networks. In conclusion, while the term \\"channel\\" appears in both sentences, it represents different concepts in the field of communication technology.

Here is a news article: Concerned Women for America, the right-leaning women’s group, is calling on Herman Cain to say whether he faced complaints about his personal behavior from female employees at the National Restaurant Association who later left the organization with financial settlements. CWA president Penny Nance told POLITICO: “I think Herman Cain needs to directly answer the question.” “Early in my career I resigned from a trade association for the exact same reason and with no financial settlement. I simply found another job,” Nance said. “Therefore, I know in a very personal way that sexual harassment exists and that it's demeaning and painful. It should never be tolerated in the workforce and certainly not the White House.” She continued, though, saying the report of sexually suggestive behavior toward women was not “consistent with my experience with Herman Cain.” “I have to say in all fairness that this characterization is completely contrary to the Herman Cain I know. Herman Cain has only been 100% respectful and deferential to me. I have never heard other women in conservative political circles complain of his behavior and they would complain loudly,” Nance said. “Our character and reputations are really all we have at the end of the day. Before I besmirch Herman Cain's I would need more than this.” POLITICO reported Sunday night that Cain was accused of inappropriate behavior by multiple employees at the National Restaurant Association; the trade group reached financial settlements with several women who also left their jobs. The biggest question for Cain, as the week begins, is whether he will be able to rally the GOP base to his defense or whether his staunchest supporters will abandon him in the wake of the allegations. And that, in turn, probably depends on whether Cain can definitively address the charges and give the answers conservatives like Nance are looking for. Former White House press secretary Dana Perino increased the pressure on Cain in a morning appearance on “Fox and Friends.” The George W. Bush administration alum said the Cain campaign’s equivocal answers about whether there had been settlements with NRA employees would not “be enough, for Herman Cain.” “Cain … will have to stand on his own two feet for the rest of the week,” she said. “Herman Cain has to have a better answer to the type of question that Geraldo asked when he goes on TV later today.” ||||| MICHELE BACHMANN June Iowa Poll: 22 percent October Iowa Poll: 8 percent Bachmann lands in fourth place — a 14-point tumble since June. The U.S. representative from Minnesota, 55, campaigns in churches and pitches herself as a child of Christ, but even voters who identify themselves as born-again Christians aren’t going her way. Among that key caucus constituency, 11 percent pick Bachmann as their first choice. (Herman Cain is at 26 percent.) And she’s the second choice of only 6 percent, the new poll shows. Bachmann claims this is the year conservatives don’t have to compromise by nominating a more moderate candidate. More likely caucusgoers agree with her than not. But among that group, she ties for third with Ron Paul at 10 percent. And her history of founding the tea party caucus in Congress gets her a little mileage. Among tea party supporters, Bachmann ranks fourth (10 percent) after Cain (27 percent), Romney (15 percent) and Paul (13 percent). The Waterloo native had as good a launch as a campaign could orchestrate: a shining debate showing on June 13, a heady surge to second place in the June Iowa Poll, a formal announcement in her birthplace, and a victory in the Iowa straw poll on Aug. 13. Then Rick Perry’s entry in the race on straw poll day snuffed out her candlepower. Today, she’s 1 point ahead of him in Iowa. HERMAN CAIN June Iowa Poll: 10 percent October Iowa Poll: 23 percent Cain, 65, a former executive for Burger King and Godfather’s Pizza, has risen 13 points since June, even though he’s visited Iowa just once since mid-August. He’s defying the playbook for doing well in Iowa. So what’s the secret in his sauce? Men give Cain his first-place showing: 26 percent prefer him; Mitt Romney gets 18 percent. (For women, it is almost an exact flip; they prefer Romney 27 percent to Cain’s 17 percent.) The furthest-right voters are under Cain’s thumb. Of those who say they’re “very” conservative, 24 percent go to Cain. Michele Bachmann ranks at 12 percent, then Newt Gingrich at 11 percent. Cain also has upside potential with secondary votes. Nineteen percent pick him as their second choice, ahead of Gingrich (13 percent) and Romney (11 percent). Add first or second choice together, and the race is less competitive: Cain claims 42 percent to Romney’s 33 percent. Several poll participants interviewed said they regretted voting for Bachmann or others at the Iowa straw poll the instant they heard Cain speak. But he was the last to take the stage, and by then it was too late. NEWT GINGRICH June Iowa Poll: 7 percent October Iowa Poll: 7 percent Gingrich, 68, the key face of Republican opposition to Democrats during President Bill Clinton’s administration, is tied for fifth place with Rick Perry. The former U.S. House speaker earned the most enthusiastic crowd response of any of the six candidates at the Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition forum on Oct. 22, the day before this poll went into the field. But Gingrich has the same level of support at 7 percent as he had in June. The June poll was conducted not long after he used the word “radical” to describe U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s plan to privatize Medicare, and more than 40 percent of respondents at the time said they had an unfavorable view of him. Now, 9 percent of likely caucusgoers say they like him the least, a better ranking than Michele Bachmann (16 percent), Mitt Romney (14 percent), Ron Paul (12 percent) and Rick Perry (11 percent). Were something to arise during the campaign to lessen Herman Cain’s appeal, Romney would be the biggest beneficiary — but Gingrich is next. He would get 23 percent of Cain defectors. JON HUNTSMAN June Iowa Poll: 2 percent October Iowa Poll: 1 percent Huntsman, 51, a relatively moderate Republican who served as President Barack Obama’s ambassador to China, finishes at the bottom of the poll. Huntsman, who lives in Washington, D.C., has said he won’t compete in Iowa, citing his opposition to ethanol subsidies. But there are other issues where he’s at odds with most Iowa Republicans, such as his support as Utah’s governor for civil unions for same-sex couples. He flitted briefly into Iowa in August for a nationally televised debate. RON PAUL June Iowa Poll: 7 percent October Iowa Poll: 12 percent Paul, 76, who is running for president for the third time, has risen into third place. University of Northern Iowa political science professor Chris Larimer correctly pegged Paul’s current support without seeing the results of this poll: The Texas congressman is “still the most predictable candidate in terms of support, always finishing third with approximately 12 percent of the vote,” he said last week. Paul routinely attracts big crowds of young adults with his message of less government, drug legalization and ending war. He drew 1,200 people to an Oct. 21 University of Iowa appearance. This poll shows that Paul does better with younger voters than older people — he’s the first choice for 18 percent of those under 35. But it’s Mitt Romney who wins this age group, with 27 percent. Cain gets 21 percent. RICK PERRY June Iowa Poll: Not yet a candidate October Iowa Poll: 7 percent This is the first Iowa Poll measuring support for Rick Perry, 61, who entered the race in South Carolina on Iowa straw poll day, Aug. 13. He’s tied for fifth with Newt Gingrich at 7 percent. On Aug. 6, the Texas governor set the tone for his pending campaign with a day of Christian prayers in Houston that drew 30,000 believers. He invited other governors to join him in praying for God’s guidance through the country’s moral and financial struggles. Yet Perry finds support from just 7 percent of born-again Christians. Only Jon Huntsman fares worse with this group, at zero. Herman Cain does best, at 26 percent. Michele Bachmann is next at 11 percent. Perry blazed to an Iowa polling zenith of 29 percent — 11 points ahead — in a Rasmussen Reports survey on Aug. 31. His numbers have collapsed since, attributed to his tangled speaking skills in debates. He is now a second-tier candidate, said Christopher Larimer, a political science professor at the University of Northern Iowa. MITT ROMNEY June Iowa Poll: 23 percent October Iowa Poll: 22 percent Romney, 64, glides in at 22 percent, down one point from June. More than anything, this poll shows how polarized likely GOP caucusgoers are about him. Romney is more popular than any other candidate with the under-35 age group. He’s the first choice for 27 percent of them, compared to 21 percent for Herman Cain and 18 percent for Ron Paul. He also is top choice among seniors, with 33 percent. Cain is at 15 percent, his poorest showing among any age group. Among those who say their minds are made up, Romney gets 24 percent, tying with Paul for first. Evangelical voters stalled his campaign here four years ago, and this survey shows they believe his social conservative bona fides are suspect. He’s at the bottom of their list, save for Jon Huntsman, who gets not a single vote. Another big warning flag for Romney: Those who definitely intend to caucus don’t like him much. This group is 38 percent of those polled, but Romney is the first choice of just 10 percent of them. Cain is the strongest among definite attenders with 27 percent. And likely caucusgoers don’t see him as their backup: 11 percent designated him their second choice, behind Cain and Gingrich. RICK SANTORUM June Iowa Poll: 4 percent October Iowa Poll: 5 percent Santorum, 53, a religious conservative who has positioned himself as the steadiest anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage voice in the race, leads the candidates in the number of Iowa campaign visits, long considered a linchpin to success in Iowa. But born-again Christians have not rallied around Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania. He ties with Mitt Romney at 9 percent. Herman Cain leads with this group at 26 percent. Santorum intends to barnstorm about 20 Iowa counties this week to reach the every-county mark of 99. Christopher Larimer, a political science professor at the University of Northern Iowa, wonders whether 2011 has ushered in a new style for success in Iowa. “(Tim) Pawlenty and Santorum ran traditional campaigns in terms of what has worked in the past, but both have failed to catch on in Iowa,” he said. “Maybe all the critics who argue Iowa allows candidates to advance who perform poorly at the national level won’t hold this year.” Recommended Photos ||||| Republican Presidential hopeful Herman Cain campaigns in Talladega, Ala., Friday, Oct. 28, 2011. (Dave Martin/AP) In four early primary states, according to recent CNN polls,Romney significantly outperformed Cain with female Republicans in every contest save South Carolina. In Iowa, where the two contenders are statistically tied, Romney took 28 percent of female voters and Cain got 17. Politico reported Sunday that Cain was accused of sexual harassment by two former employees at the National Restaurant Association, which he led in the 1990s, and that the women left with financial settlements. Cain told Fox News Monday that he “never sexually harassed anyone” and “was falsely accused.” If even more women turn against Cain, it could give Romney — who already does better with female than male voters — the chance to pull ahead in the GOP presidential primary. The Des Moines Register wrote Sunday that in the new Iowa poll that showed Cain and Romney neck-and-neck, men were behind Cain’s success — 26 percent prefer him while only 18 percent backed Romney. The numbers were almost exactly the reverse for Romney with female respondents — the former governor beat Cain 27 to 17 percent. A national CNN survey last week found Cain performing ten points better with men than with women while tying Romney overall. Fox News found similar results. And in recent Time magazine head-to-head matchups with President Obama, Romney was only 8 points behind Obama with women while Cain was 21 points back. While conservatives rallied around Texas Gov. Rick Perry after the Post reported on a racial slur written on a rock at the candidate’s hunting camp, so far Cain has not gotten similar support. Conservative Women for America, a right-leaning Christian group, is asked for more answers from Cain; the group’s president told Politico she once left a job due to sexual harassment. So did former White House press secretary Dana Perino said on Fox News Monday morning. Strategist Karl Rove and former National Republican Campaign Committee Chairman Tom Davis (R-Va.) also criticized Cain’s response. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The news article discusses allegations of inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment against Herman Cain, a former Republican presidential candidate in the 2012 race. Concerned Women for America (CWA), a right-leaning women's group, called on Cain to address these allegations, which involved female employees at the National Restaurant Association. POLITICO had reported that multiple employees accused Cain of inappropriate behavior and financial settlements were reached with several women who then left their jobs. CWA president Penny Nance asked Cain to directly answer questions about the allegations, sharing her personal experience with sexual harassment and emphasizing that it should never be tolerated. She noted, however, that Cain's reported behavior was inconsistent with her experience with him. Cain continued to receive support from some conservative circles, but the article suggests that his ability to rally the GOP base to defend him might depend on how he addresses the allegations. Some high-profile Republicans like Dana Perino and Karl Rove criticized Cain's response. The article also provides a detailed analysis of various presidential candidate's positions and support in the polls, particularly focusing on the Iowa poll. Mitt Romney and Herman Cain were neck-and-neck at the time, with Romney doing better with female voters while Cain had more support from men. The impact of the allegations against Cain on his support from women remained to be seen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Noo noo I must learn Tommorow I have two exams :/ Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","completion":"The sentiment embodied by this tweet is a mixture of surprise, realization, urgency, and anxiety about the impending examinations. The use of \\"Noo noo\\" reflects a sudden, unexpected realization that they have upcoming exams on the following day and perhaps haven't prepared enough, which evokes a sense of disbelief, shock, or even slight panic. Simultaneously, the text communicates the feeling of urgency in the phrase \\"I must learn.\\" It demonstrates the individual's awareness that they need to study or perform some serious last-minute preparations in order to tackle the exams. This underlines the importance they place on their academic performance and their desire to succeed. Additionally, the user's choice to emphasize the fact that they have \\"two exams\\" adds weight to their situation. Instead of just one exam, which, although still significant, could potentially be managed better with some focused studying, the user points out that they face the challenge of two exams, which increases the pressure and workload, amplifying their feelings of anxiety and stress. The use of the word \\"Tommorow\\" heightens the urgency and reveals the short time-frame the individual has to prepare, further increasing the stress that they are experiencing. The use of shorthand text (abbreviating \\"tomorrow\\" and \\"I\\" and the emoticon-like concluding symbol) may suggest a rushed, pressured state of mind, as well as potential frustration. Lastly, the emoticon-like symbol \\":/\\" at the end of the tweet indicates a sense of worry, uncertainty and dissatisfaction with the situation they find themselves in, and could reflect their self-doubt or insecurity about their ability to perform well on the upcoming exams. In conclusion, the sentiment embedded in this tweet portrays strong emotions such as surprise, urgency, anxiety, and stress, all revolving around the realization of having two exams the next day and limited time to prepare. The tweet also highlights the importance of education, individual performance, and the pressure of short deadlines in the context of exams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As an unidentified voice over narrates, this trip to the country has alternate layers of meaning and understanding and this is evident in the overbearing presence of Jolly Jimmy Johnson (Derek Royle), the tour guide.

State Department Says U.S. Brought ‘Peace, Security’ to Syria in 2015 Over at the State Department’s official “DipNote” blog, John Kirby, the spokesperson for the department, is heralding Foggy Bottom’s 2015 accomplishments with the hashtag, #2015in5Words. In some cases, it’s a bit that works: For instance, the blog appropriately marks the thaw in relations with Cuba with, “Diplomatic Relations Re-established With Cuba.” However, in the case of Syria, the five words State used to describe the past year seem at the very least inappropriate and at the worst delusional. The Syrian entry, dated Christmas eve, is entitled, “Bringing Peace, Security to Syria.” Kirby’s entry notes that the conflict there “has continued to unfold in tragic ways over the course of 2015,” including the humanitarian crisis forcing refugees to flee the Syrian civil war, and human rights violations by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Kirby continues, “The United States and many members of the international community have stepped up to aid the Syrian people during their time of need,” and argued that Secretary of State John Kerry is leading the push to get Assad out of office, and pressed the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution designed to begin the political transition from the Syrian strongman. On the one hand, it’s understandable that State would note Syria in its 2015 roundup. The war there dominated headlines throughout the year, and leaving it off the list could draw more attention than actually including it. On the other hand, it’s hard to argue that the United States brought any significant “peace” or “security” to the Syrian people. According to the United Nations, as of October 2015 some 250,000 people have been killed in more than four years of civil war (casualty figures for 2015 alone are not yet available). More than 11 million refugees have left the region, many of whom swelled onto European shores in the fall of 2015; it’s not clear how many will ever get asylum in Europe, or elsewhere around the world, including in the United States. A March 2015 UN report also noted that four in five Syrians are now living in poverty. The Barack Obama administration, meanwhile, has struggled to keep pace with the rapidly deteriorating situation there. After spending years prioritizing Assad’s departure, Washington has now hinted that he could stay in power longer to aid in the fight against the Islamic State. The White House has also reluctantly found itself battling the Islamic State alongside Russia and Iran, staunch Assad supporters whose ultimate goals in Syria are unlikely to match those of the United States. After long promising there would be no American boots on the ground in Syria, meanwhile, President Obama signed off on the deployment of dozens of U.S. Special Operations personnel there. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the commandos are active in northern Syria, and are focused on building an anti-Islamic State partnership with Syrian Arab rebels. Diplomats are ever careful in the language they use to describe international affairs. When it comes to Syria, “peace” and “security” might not be the best choice to describe what the United States delivered there in 2015. With Russia now complicating U.S. war plans for the region, it might be a long time coming until those two things can be established in a nation destroyed by years of war.

His message got me thinking about the pivotal foreign policy events that took place this year, and a great hashtag – #2015in5Words – which was recently trending on Twitter. Surely the year was not without challenges. Our hearts are with the families that lost loved ones to terrorism, natural disasters, disease, and violence. Our work to secure our national interests and to build peace and enhance prosperity around the world continues in honor of them. At the same time, it’s also important to take a step back and look at how the United States has helped change the world for the better. Our diplomats have been busy, and they have met with significant success across a range of issues – each of these issues vital in their own way to ensuring the safety, security, and prosperity of the American people. So, here's my take on #2015in5Words. Diplomatic Relations Re-established With Cuba. #2015in5Words U.S. and Cuba Re-establish Diplomatic Relations: In January, Cuba and the United States began talks to re-establish diplomatic relations after 54 years. Those talks resulted in the July re-opening of the Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C. and the United States Embassy in Havana. To mark the occasion, Secretary Kerry traveled to Havana, Cuba, where he watched as the American flag was raised at the Embassy building there. By his side stood three retired U.S. Marines – the very same ones who lowered the flag at our Embassy in Havana more than five decades earlier. The achievement is just the first step in strengthening our relationship with the Cuban people, and those links continue to deepen with each new development, like the resumption of scheduled flights and mail delivery between our two countries. We look forward to further deepening these ties in the New Year. (More about U.S.-Cuba Relations on DipNote) Winning Fight Against Violent Extremists. #2015in5words The White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism: In February, the White House hosted the Summit on Countering Violent Extremism (CVE), bringing together foreign leaders, senior officials from the United Nations and other international organizations, and private and civil society representatives to discuss the challenges facing nations working to prevent and counter violent extremism. This monumental summit launched an ongoing global CVE effort now underway that reaches throughout the world and across countless nations. Although challenges remain, we have made positive strides over the last year, including in our fight against ISIL. This forward progress will only continue as more countries pledge resources to the anti-ISIL effort and as citizens around the world increasingly reject ISIL's misguided ideology. Moving forward we know that together the global coalition – active both on the battlefield and on the airwaves – can and will degrade and ultimately destroy extremist organizations, like ISIL. (More on CVE) Protecting Arctic Climate and Communities. #2015in5words U.S. Chairmanship of Arctic Council: Secretary Kerry traveled to Iqaluit, Canada in April to attend the biennial Arctic Council Ministerial. While there, he formally assumed the two-year chairmanship of the Arctic Council from his Canadian predecessor and announced that the Council would focus on three key themes: the impacts of climate change; promoting Arctic Ocean safety, security and stewardship; and improving economic and living conditions for Arctic communities. The Artic it is not just a picturesque landscape. It’s a home. It’s an ecosystem. It has a history. And we all have a duty to protect it and its people.

After weeks of intense multilateral negotiations on the ground in Vienna, it was announced that an agreement had been reached, one that would ensure Iran’s nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful. On that day Secretary Kerry spoke to the press, stating that “the agreement we’ve reached, fully implemented, will bring insight and accountability to Iran’s nuclear program – not for a small number of years, but for the lifetime of that program. This is the good deal that we have sought.” (More about the Iran Deal on DipNote) Stemming Tide of Ebola Outbreak. #2015in5words Ebola Response: August 2015 marked the one-year anniversary of the United States government’s robust response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa, an unprecedented effort that has helped turn the tide of an unprecedented outbreak. The United States was actively involved in fighting Ebola from the beginning, sending more than 3,000 people – including aid professionals, public-health specialists, soldiers and logisticians from USAID’s Disaster Assistance Response Team and the Center for Disease Control – to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea at the height of the response to support more than 10,000 civilian responders. Even as the situation on-the-ground improved over the course of 2015, the United States continued to respond to the crisis, working to contain the outbreak of the virus with the goal of getting to zero new infections. And while the Ebola outbreak now has been brought under control, the U.S. remains steadfast in working with its partners to ensure monitoring continues unabated so as to prevent any resurgence of the epidemic. Health crises like Ebola threaten the security of communities and countries. The United States remains committed to helping nations build capacity to prevent events like this in the future, and build a brighter world for our children. (More about Ebola Response on DipNote) Committing to Ambitious Development Goals. #2015in5words Sustainable Development Goals Adopted by United Nations: At the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) hosted this past September in New York, UN member nations came together to adopt an ambitious set of global goals that seek to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. During UNGA, President Obama pledged the United States’ support for the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), saying “in times of disaster and crisis, the world can count on the friendship and generosity of the American people.” While enormous progress has been made in tackling the development challenges that confront millions around the world, there is still much to be done and the SDGs mark an important milestone in to global effort to put our world on an inclusive and sustainable course moving forward.

Not only does this agreement set high standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property, but it will also serve to deepen our partnerships throughout the Asia-Pacific region – a message Secretary Kerry reinforced when he said, “With today's successful conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, the United States and 11 other nations have taken a critical step forward in strengthening our economic ties and deepening our strategic relationships in the Asia-Pacific region.” (More about Trade on DipNote) Protecting Health of Our Ocean. #2015in5words Second “Our Ocean” Conference: Also in October, the Chilean government hosted the second global “Our Ocean” conference in Valparaiso. During the conference -- which brought together individuals, experts, practitioners, advocates, lawmakers, and the international ocean and foreign policy communities to look at ways to protect our ocean -- the United States announced the creation of two new national marine sanctuaries. Secretary Kerry also used the opportunity to underscore three key areas for engagement: ocean monitoring, stopping illegal fishing, and climate change. The United States will host the next “Our Ocean” conference in 2016 demonstrating the Secretary’s personal commitment to making preservation of oceans a central part of our security agenda.

On December 12, it was announced that a global climate agreement had been reached. Secretary Kerry lauded the historic moment, saying in Paris “I think that we’ve reached an agreement here that is the strongest, most ambitious global climate change agreement ever negotiated.” (More about COP21 on DipNote) Bringing Peace, Security to Syria. #2015in5words Syria: The conflict in Syria has continued to unfold in tragic ways over the course of 2015. From the humanitarian crisis endured by refugees fleeing violence, to the reprehensible human rights violations and violence carried out by the Asad regime, the Syrian people have borne a heavy load. The United States and many members of the international community have stepped up to aid the Syrian people during their time of need – the United States has led the world in humanitarian aid contributions since the crisis began in 2011. Led by Secretary Kerry, the United States also continues to push for a political transition in Syria, and under his stewardship, in December, the UN Security Council passed a U.S.-sponsored resolution that puts forward a roadmap that will facilitate a transition within Syria to a credible, inclusive, nonsectarian government that is responsive to the needs of the Syrian people.

Angered upon not being invited to the christening, Maleficent curses the princess, proclaiming that before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of an enchanted spinning wheel and die. After Maleficent leaves, Merryweather uses her blessing to weaken the curse so that Aurora instead will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's first kiss.

Pam Burkhart's character is a somewhat detached, self-absorbed, and absent mother to Jackie, played by Mila Kunis. Throughout the series, it is seen that Jackie's relationship with her mother is rocky and not very supportive. Pam is focused on her appearance and is more of a friend than a mother, which also affects how Jackie behaves and treats others. Pam's character is significant in the show because of the way it shapes Jackie's personality and development. During the time Brooke Shields played the role of Pam Burkhart, her storyline included a divorce from Jackie's millionaire father, Jack Burkhart, and an affair with Steven Hyde's (played by Danny Masterson) father, Bud Hyde (played by Robert Hays).

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Q: Context: As was discussed in previous concepts, both infectious and noninfectious diseases of the reproductive system can be very serious. But there are ways to keep your reproductive system healthy. What can you do to keep your reproductive system healthy? You can start by making the right choices for overall good health. To be as healthy as you can be, you should: Eat a balanced diet that is high in fiber and low in fat. Drink plenty of water. Get regular exercise. Maintain a healthy weight. Get enough sleep. Avoid using tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs. Manage stress in healthy ways. Keeping your genitals clean is also very important. A daily shower or bath is all that it takes. Females do not need to use special feminine hygiene products. In fact, using them may do more harm than good because they can irritate the vagina or other reproductive structures. You should also avoid other behaviors that can put you at risk. Do not get into contact with another persons blood or other body fluids. For example, never get a tattoo or piercing unless you are sure that the needles have not been used before. This is one of the most important ways to prevent an STI. Of course, the only way to be fully protected against STIs is to refrain from sexual activity. If you are a boy, you should always wear a protective cup when you play contact sports. Contact sports include football, boxing, and hockey. Wearing a cup will help protect the testes from injury. You should also do a monthly self-exam to check for cancer of the testes. If you are a girl and use tampons, be sure to change them every four to six hours. Leaving tampons in for too long can put you at risk of toxic shock syndrome. This is a serious condition. Signs and symptoms of toxic shock syndrome develop suddenly, and the disease can be fatal. The disease involves fever, shock, and problems with the function of several body organs. Girls should also get in the habit of doing a monthly self-exam to check for breast cancer. Although breast cancer is rare in teens, its a good idea to start doing the exam when you are young.

It has been claimed that Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis had a long-running personal vendetta against Channel 7 and in particular their Sunrise program. Monis spent six years lobbying the Australian media watchdog over what he perceived were breaches of broadcasting regulations involving Sunrise news segments. The hostage-taker died along with two of the 17 hostages he took in the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place just metres from Channel 7's Sunrise studio last week. The attack took place so near 7's offices it prompted speculation the Sunrise studio was his target from the very beginning, but that his initial plans went awry. Fairfax revealed that the 50-year-old first complained in mid-2007 to the ACMA about a Sunrise program broadcast on July 4 of that year. In later ranting letters to other authorities about the","completion":"matter, Monis claimed that the Sunrise program had deliberately manipulated the news and had shown a biased perspective in their coverage of certain events. He felt that the program was ignoring his concerns and continuously engaging in deceptive reporting practices. Monis also accused the show's producers and hosts of mocking him and dismissing any valid points he raised. His relentless pursuit of action against Channel 7 and the Sunrise team led to multiple failed attempts to bring legal claims against the broadcaster. The Australian media watchdog, ACMA, reviewed his complaints on several occasions, ultimately finding no wrongdoings on the part of the Sunrise program or its staff. Over the years, Monis continued to express his frustration with the show, even resorting to social media to voice his complaints. It became increasingly evident that his vendetta against Channel 7's Sunrise program had evolved into a deeply personal issue, bordering on obsession. With the Sydney siege as a terrifying culmination of his grievances against the program, it is undeniable that Man Haron Monis had a deep-rooted grudge towards Channel 7 and the Sunrise team. While the exact reasoning behind his actions remains a subject of debate, one thing is clear: the Lindt Cafe attack has cast a dark cloud over the station and those involved in the Sunrise program, forever staining the memory of that tragic day. It is crucial for media outlets to continue reporting on events as accurately and fairly as possible, while also being sensitive to the reactions of their audience.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Cake was formed in 1991 when John McCrea, a Sacramento, California native who had moved to Los Angeles with a band only to see it \\"quickly crumble around him\\", returned to Sacramento. He began looking for a new band to play with, having \\"grown tired of Sacramento's coffeehouse circuit\\", and quickly attracted trumpet player Vince DiFiore, guitarist Greg Brown, bassist Shon Meckfessel and drummer Frank French. All were active in the music scene at the time; DiFiore notes that \\"[McCrea] came back and stole us from other bands\\". The band soon came up with the name \\"Cake\\"; rather than referring to the foodstuff, the name is meant to be \\"like when something insidiously becomes a part of your life...[we] mean it more as something that cakes onto your shoe and is just sort of there until you get rid of it\\". Meckfessel soon left to attend college, and was replaced by Gabe Nelson. After touring and becoming part of the club scene in San Francisco, the band independently recorded and released Motorcade of Generosity in 1994, selling copies from their van as a method of paying touring expenses. Motorcade was named one of the best indie releases of 1994 by Pulse!, and after a concert at the Great American Music Hall Bonnie Simmons agreed to manage the band, leading to them signing a deal with Capricorn Records, who re-released the album in 1995. The first single, Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle, hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes. Critical reactions to the album were largely positive; Stephen Thompson in the Wisconsin State Journal described it as possessing \\"great lyrics, creative instrumentation and production that's about as simple as production gets\\", Thomas Conner praised it for being \\"soulful and smooth, witty and gritty, this record makes the ghosts of Bob Wills, Buddy Holly and Lou Reed smile\\" in the Tulsa World, and Matt Weitz in the Dallas Observer noted its \\"gimlet eye and sardonic humor\\". The album was eventually nominated for a Bammy Award in the category of \\"Outstanding Debut Album\\". Nevertheless, some critics were less appreciative; John Wirt, in The Advocate, praised the album's sense of humor and \\"delicious\\" irreverence but noted that \\"[the] musicianship in Motorcade of Generosity suggests the Cake guys are mediocre players\\". Mindy LaBernz, in The Austin Chronicle, described the album as \\"cover-free, and, since we're on the subject, genre-free. A quartet made five by a trumpet player, Cake carry themselves with the snittiness of technically proficient, lyrically aware music lovers, who are almost anachronistically untrendy and brazenly proud of it\\". The signing to Capricorn and re-release of Motorcade led to both French and Nelson leaving the band, citing their dislike of \\"the prospect of extensive national touring\\"; they were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani respectively. Fashion Nugget, Cake's second album, was released on September 17, 1996. Like Motorcade, it was produced by the band and released on Capricorn Records. Cake considered the album more professionally produced than Motorcade, despite references to its \\"raw\\" sound, and the reception was again generally positive; critics noted the broadening of Cake's sound, with Joshua Green noting in the Westword that \\"Nugget spans a broader range of topics than did Motorcade, with similarly appealing results\\", and Matt Weitz in the Dallas Observer saying that \\"The gimlet eye and sardonic humor of 1994's Motorcade of Generosity is intact, but Fashion Nugget is aptly named; it updates Motorcade with beatboxy soul and hip-hop rhythms\\". The album's first single, \\"The Distance\\", written by Greg Brown, became the band's biggest hit to date and is considered their \\"ubiquitous\\" song; it hit number 5 on the RPM Alternative 30, and entered the Modern Rock Tracks top 5. On the strength of \\"The Distance\\", Fashion Nugget was certified gold on December 9, 1996 and platinum on April 10, 1997. The second single from Fashion Nugget, a cover of the Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris song \\"I Will Survive\\", hit number 38 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. Although the band described it as a serious take on the original, one they'd been playing live for years, original performer Gloria Gaynor considers it her least favorite version of the song due to its use of profanity. Following Fashion Nugget's release, the band toured the United States, playing in cities including Tulsa, Chicago, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Dallas. They later toured overseas, visiting the United Kingdom as a support act for Counting Crows, playing their own shows alongside the tour at venues including Dingwalls in London. The band also toured Japan; a later tour of the US, starting in Minneapolis in June 1997, was cancelled due to illness when McCrea was diagnosed with \\"fatigue and extreme exhaustion\\". After McCrea recovered, the band continued touring, playing at the Big Stink festival in Vancouver, Washington, and the Jayhawk Music Festival in Lawrence, Kansas. 1997 also saw lineup changes; bassist Victor Damiani and guitarist Greg Brown both left, prompting speculation about the band's survival; McCrea noted that \\"Musically, there was a really great symbiosis and I really felt that it (their departures, especially Brown's) was the most stupid thing in the world\\", and said that he had considered dissolving the band. Brown and Damiani formed the \\"new-wave influenced\\" Deathray; their places within Cake were taken by Xan McCurdy and Gabe Nelson, whom McCrea persuaded to rejoin the band. For their fourth album, Comfort Eagle, the band signed a deal with Columbia Records. Comfort Eagle was both produced and arranged by the band, and was recorded at Paradise Studios in Sacramento and Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco. Following the recording, drummer Todd Roper left the band, citing the demands extended touring would put on his time, and the commitments his two children, Griffin and Bella, represented. He was replaced by Pete McNeal. The album's release was preceded by the release of its first single, \\"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\\", described as a parable about \\"the relationship between prosperity and the population boom ... There's nothing more procreational than economic prosperity\\". An accompanying video was directed by McCrea, and recorded using the DV system; it featured vox populi recordings of members of the public listening to the song and giving their opinion. \\"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\\" hit number 2 on the Bear Rock Top 10 in Canada and number 7 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks; the video became one of the 30 most requested tracks on MTV; Billboard writers later listed the video as the 5th best of 2001. Comfort Eagle itself was released on July 24, 2001, to good reviews; Michael D. Clark of The Houston Chronicle described it as \\"Cake at its best\\", while a reviewer for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution stated that the album's songs were \\"among the best of the band's career\\", praising McCrea for widening his vocal repertoire. James Montgomery, writing for UWIRE, noted a stylistic change, saying that \\"While the core sound of the band - honky tonk guitars, mariachi horns and salsa rhythms - remain intact, they have been stripped down to the core, replaced instead with ill Casio beats, rubbery funk and Stax-style horn bleats\\". The album sold 22,000 copies in its first week, the highest sales in the band's history, and eventually went gold. With the exception of a slot at the Atlanta On The Bricks Festival, playing for 90,000 people, the band chose to start the tour with small rather than large shows, such as in the Sacramento area, where they played for around 100 people. They launched their first full tour for the album in September, playing in the United States, Canada and across Europe. A second single, \\"Love You Madly\\", was released in 2002, with an accompanying video again produced by McCrea. The video featured DiFiore and McNeal competing in a cooking competition, judged by Rick James, Phyllis Diller and Jeff Smith, and was noted by Billboard as \\"continuing the fresh, witty, and downright fun style seen in the \\"Short Skirt\\" video\\". Cake had planned a second tour of Europe, followed by a series of shows around the United States, but in view of the September 11 attacks chose not to travel overseas. Instead, the band streamed a performance internationally from the Yahoo! headquarters in California, playing emailed requests. The United States tour went ahead as planned, with Cake playing concerts in Birmingham, Alabama, St. Petersburg, Florida, Salt Lake City, and Las Vegas. This was followed by the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, a traveling festival headlined and planned by the band and featuring Modest Mouse, De La Soul and The Flaming Lips. A second Unlimited Sunshine Tour was undertaken in 2003, featuring Cake, Cheap Trick and The Hackensaw Boys.

(Associated Press) 8:00 p.m. (6:00 p.m. GMT) President Obama has telephoned USAF Airman First Class Spencer Stone, Army National Guard Specialist Aleksander Skarlatos, and Anthony Sadler to commend and congratulate them for their courage and quick action aboard their Paris-bound train last night. Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said Obama expressed gratitude to the trio for their heroic actions forestalling an even greater tragedy. Obama wished Stone a full and speedy recovery, and expressed how proud all Americans are of their extraordinary bravery. ___ 7:40 p.m. (5:40 p.m. GMT) Spencer Stone, widely acclaimed as an American hero for his aggressive role in taking down the train gunman, was seen Saturday leaving a hospital in Lille where he was treated for a hand injury. He walked out, waved quickly and slipped into a black sedan with diplomatic license plates. It was not immediately clear where he was headed. Stone, who is in the Air Force, was also commended for helping an injured train passenger, a French-American, bleeding from a gunshot wound. That passenger, a teacher who resides outside Paris, was being treated in another hospital in Lille. French President Francois Hollande said in a statement that he spoke with President Barack Obama to personally thank him for the \\"exemplary conduct of American citizens who stopped an extremely serious attack.\\" ____ 5:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. GMT) Chris Norman, a British businessman who helped three Americans to subdue the train gunman, said he was working on his computer when he heard a shot and glass breaking. He said his first reaction was to hide. \\"Then I heard one guy, an American, say 'go get him,' and another American say 'Don't you do that buddy.'\\" Norman was the fourth to join in subduing the gunman. Norman told reporters: \\"He had a Kalashnikov, he had a magazine full, I don't know how many magazines he had. My thought was, OK, probably I'm going to die anyway. So, let's go. I'd rather die being active.\\" Norman, who was returning from a business trip in the Netherlands to his home in southern France, said the gunman was small and not visibly strong but \\"he put up quite a bit of a fight.\\" ___ 3:30 p.m. (1:30 p.m. GMT) The Belgian government has stepped up rail security after a gunman who boarded a Thalys train in Brussels was subdued by passengers on the Paris-bound service. After a meeting of the country's national security council Saturday, Prime Minister Charles Michel's office announced that mixed Franco-Belgian security patrols would be beefed up on the high-speed Thalys trains, which link major cities in the Netherlands and Belgium to Paris. Patrols and security checks will also be boosted at international rail stations, and more baggage checks will now be carried out. Police have also been warned to be on alert at major events and public gatherings. Before the incident, Spanish authorities had warned Belgium about a suspect in the country with links to Islamic extremists. However, the suspect held in France has not been officially identified. ___ 2:55 p.m. (12:45 p.m. GMT) French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade, whose finger was injured \\"to the bone\\" as he broke the emergency alarm glass, told the magazine Paris-Match that passengers thought they were going to die \\"because we were prisoners of this train.\\" Anglade said he, his two children and companion were in the last car, No. 11, one car away from No. 12 where the gunman was tackled and subdued. He said, \\"We heard passengers shouting in English, 'He's firing, he's firing. He has a Kalashnikov.'\\" He said he saw train personnel running down the corridor to take refuge in their work car, and claimed they locked the door and refused to answer desperate knocks. Then Anthony Sadler, one of the three Americans traveling together, came into their car and said the gunman had been subdued. \\"We were in a bad spot but with good people,\\" Anglade said. \\"We were incredibly lucky to have American soldiers with us. I pay homage to their heroic courage and thank them. Without them, we all would be dead.\\" ___ 1:45 p.m. (11:45 a.m. GMT) Spencer Stone, an American Air Force serviceman stabbed while tackling a gunman on a European train, has been transferred to a larger hospital in northern France. The Pentagon has said Stone's injuries are not life-threatening. Two officials at the hospital in the northern French city of Arras where Stone was initially treated said he was transferred Saturday to a larger hospital in Lille. They did not provide a reason for the move. Stone's traveling companions say he intervened to immobilize the suspect, and the gunman stabbed Stone with a box-cutter. Stone then acted quickly to help reduce the bleeding of another wounded passenger, they said, praising his bravery. Stone is stationed in the Azores and is from Carmichael, California, according to the stepmother of one of the Americans aboard. ___ 1:25 p.m. (11:25 a.m. GMT) French President Francois Hollande will meet with several American and French citizens who helped subdue a gunman on a high-speed train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris. Hollande's office said in a statement Saturday that he would meet with them at the presidential palace in the coming days to \\"express France's gratitude.\\" Three Americans, a British passenger and a French passenger were involved in the action to wrestle the man to the ground and disarm him after he fired a weapon on the train, according to accounts from three of them and French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.

Add Interest Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos, and Anthony Sadler were on a train from Amsterdam to Paris on Friday when a man armed with an automatic rifle and a box cutter started attacking passengers. Sadler was visiting Stone, 23, an Air Force airman first class stationed in Portugal, and Skarlatos, 23, an Army National Guard specialist stationed in Afghanistan. \\"I came to see my friends on my first trip in Europe and we stopped a terrorist,\\" Sadler told Eurovision. \\"It's kind of crazy.\\" Sadler said that during the ride they heard a gunshot and glass shattering in the train car behind them. They then saw an armed man entering their carriage and holding an automatic weapon as if he was ready to begin firing. \\"Alek just yells, 'Spencer go!' and Spencer just gets up within five seconds of the guy being in the car and just rushes back there,\\" Sadler said. \\"He gets up, I get up and Alek gets up and all three of us just rush back there.\\" Stone tackled the attacker to the ground, Sadler said. As Sadler, Skarlatos, and a fourth passenger, Chris Norman, jumped in to hold him down, the attacker pulled out a box cutter and slashed Stone, Sadler said. Stone's finger was nearly severed, according to his family. \\"I just wish he [Stone] didn’t have to get hurt, but they saved lives,\\" Stone’s mother, Joyce Eskel, told ABC affiliate KXTV-TV in Sacramento, California.

He was being interviewed by French counter-terrorism officials Saturday, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said. Cazeneuve said did not release the suspect's name, but said that if he is the man he says he is, then he is a 26-year-old Moroccan who Spanish authorities say is a member of the radical Islamist movement. A spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor said the man arrested was identified as Ayoub El Khazani. Belgian authorities were investigating where he lived and where he got the weapons, the spokesman said. According to Cazeneuve, the suspect was armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a 9mm automatic pistol and a box cutter. A French actor, Jean-Hugues Anglade, suffered non-life threatening injuries in the attack, said Cazeneuve, who also thanked the Americans for their courage and cool nerves. REUTERS ABC News' Mustafa Hameed and Rachel Katz contributed reporting. ||||| Sacramento college student Anthony Sadler was on his first trip to Europe when his heroism made him an international figure.

The attacker, armed with an automatic rifle and a box cutter, was thwarted by three Americans, one British national, and a French passenger who managed to tackle and disarm him. Two people were injured in the process, including an American Air Force serviceman who was stabbed while apprehending the attacker. French President François Hollande commended the passengers for their bravery and quick action in preventing a potentially deadly attack, expressing France's gratitude for their efforts. The Belgian government also stepped up rail security in response to the incident, with mixed Franco-Belgian security patrols being increased on Thalys trains and heightened police alert at major public gatherings."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Most people would think that aside from comets and stars, there is little else out there. But, since our space journey started we have left so much trash there that scientists are now concerned that if we don't clean it up, we may all be in mortal danger. The first piece of space junk was created in 1964, when the American satellite Vanguard I stopped operating and lost its connection with the ground center. However, since it kept orbiting around the Earth without any consequences, scientists became increasingly comfortable abandoning things that no longer served any useful purpose in space. It is estimated that there are now over 500,000 pieces of man-made trash orbiting the Earth at speeds of up to 17,500 miles per hour. The junk varies from tiny pieces of paint chipped off rockets to cameras, huge fuel tanks, and even odd items like the million-dollar tool kit that astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn Piper lost during a spacewalk. The major problem with the space trash is that it may hit working satellites and damage traveling spacecraft . Moreover, pieces of junk may collide with each other and break into pieces which fall back to the Earth. To avoid this, scientists have invented several ways for clearing the sky. Ground stations have been built to monitor larger pieces of space trash to prevent them from crashing into working satellites or space shuttles. Future plans include a cooperative effort among many nations to stop littering in space and to clean up the trash already there. Options: A A camera. B A tool kit. C A fuel tank.

With a 38-35 victory over the New York Giants at Giants Stadium Saturday night, the New England Patriots became the second team in the modern era of the National Football League to go undefeated (16-0) in the regular season. The only other team to have achieved this feat was the Miami Dolphins in 1972, who were 14-0 due to a different regular season structure at the time. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Patriots and the Dolphins played the same number of games. Available choices: a). Yes. b). It's impossible to say. c). No.","completion":"c). No. Although both the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins achieved an undefeated regular season, they did not play the same number of games during those respective seasons. The reason for this difference lies in the regular season structure at the time each team achieved their flawless records. In 1972, the NFL regular season was comprised of 14 games, allowing the Miami Dolphins to achieve a 14-0 perfect record. During that time, the NFL was divided into three divisions within each conference (AFC and NFC), with the regular season concluding with a four-team playoff structure. However, by the time the New England Patriots achieved their undefeated regular season in 2007, the NFL had undergone significant changes in its structure. The league had expanded to include 32 teams and divided them into four divisions within each conference (AFC and NFC). Consequently, the length of the regular season was extended from 14 games to the current 16 games, which allowed the Patriots to reach a 16-0 perfect record. Therefore, while both teams managed to go undefeated in their respective regular seasons, they did not play the same number of games due to the difference in regular season structure at the time of their achievements. The Miami Dolphins achieved their perfect season with a 14-0 record in 1972, while the New England Patriots attained their 16-0 record in 2007."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: How do I find the factor of the number? Second question: What is a simple formula to calculate the sum of the prime factors of a number? Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPTIONS: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"Option 1: No These two questions are asking about different things. For the first question, finding the factor of a number means identifying all numbers that can evenly divide into the said number. For example, the factors of 6 are 1,2,3,6 because these numbers divide evenly into 6. The process of finding factors by AI would be to divide the given number by all numbers less than or equal to its square root and checking if the remainder is zero. If the remainder is zero, then both the divisor and the quotient are factors. For the second question, a prime factor is a factor that is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself. For example, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. To calculate the sum of the prime factors, you add these prime factors together. For example, the sum of the prime factors of 6 is 2 + 3 = 5. The process to find the sum of prime factors by AI would involve firstly finding all prime factors. The easiest way to do this is by iteratively dividing the number by the smallest prime (2) and continue this process with the quotient until it is not divisible anymore, then go to the next smallest prime. Repeat these steps until all that remains is a prime number, that’s the last prime factor. After finding all the prime factors, simply add them together. So, the first question deals with finding all factors (not necessarily prime) of a number and the second question deals with finding only the prime factors of a number and furthermore calculating their sum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These pollutants react with water, oxygen, and other substances in the air to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), which then fall to the ground as acid rain. Step 2: Evaluate the scenario in Beijing Beijing recently opened several new coal-fired power plants. Coal-fired power plants are significant sources of SO2 and NOx emissions. These pollutants contribute to Beijing's high potential for acid rain. Step 3: Evaluate the scenario in Montreal In Montreal, manufacturing plants have significantly reduced their SO2 emissions after a recent referendum. Lower SO2 emissions mean a reduced likelihood of acid rain in the area. Step 4: Compare the two scenarios Beijing has recently increased its potential for acid rain with the opening of new coal-fired power plants, while Montreal has reduced its potential for acid rain due to lower SO2 emissions from manufacturing plants. Answer: Based on the provided information, Montreal is less likely to have acid rain compared to Beijing, since Montreal has reduced its sulfur oxides emissions, and Beijing has recently added coal-fired power plants which increase its sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions, both of which contribute to acid rain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Former English Premier League referees have jumped to the defense of Howard Webb after criticism of his performance in Sunday's World Cup final. Webb, the first referee to officiate the European Champions League final and World Cup final in the same season, dished out 13 yellow cards and one red as Spain defeated the Netherlands 1-0 in a tempestuous clash at Soccer City, Johannesburg. Dutch coach Bert Van Marwijk and several of his players suggested the English official favored the Spanish, and Netherlands fans booed Webb and his assistants when they collected their medals after the game. But ex-referee Jeff Winter, who took charge of several fiery encounters between English giants like Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, was full of praise for Webb's performance in extremely testing circumstances. \\"I thought he had a superb game,\\" Winter told CNN. \\"I find it very difficult to remember a more testing game than that at any level. I thought the players' behavior and discipline were abysmal. \\"It was as if the Dutch had decided the only way they were going to stop Spain was by kicking them, harassing the referee and being obnoxious throughout. \\"From a referee's point of view, if the players don't want to be controlled it's virtually impossible to control them. Had it had been a referee without his experience of the European game, they might have lost control within the first 30 minutes.\\" Webb's tally of 14 yellow cards -- including the red shown to Netherlands defender Johnny Heitinga in extra-time - was a record for the World Cup final. 1.

Positive In the world of low-budget, cheesy science fiction films, “Invasion of the Alien Spacelings” surely triumphs as an immensely entertaining and exciting cinematic experience for audiences craving a thrilling dose of extraterrestrial action and kitschy special effects. The film, released in 1965, follows the unexpected adventure of a small midwestern town that is suddenly invaded by the aforementioned Alien Spacelings – and their intergalactic escapade subsequently leaves a trail of havoc on the human population. Directed by the ingenious Roger Starbeam, “Invasion of the Alien Spacelings” turns its low-budget limitations into distinctive creative strengths. Starbeam maximizes the movie's limited resources by employing crafty camera angles and takes full advantage of the colorful set design, which boasts an eclectic mix of pulpy retro-futuristic main street Americana. The plastic flying saucers, visibly dangling from thin fishing wires, perfectly encapsulate the delightful campiness that the film proudly flaunts. One of the major highlights of the film is its eccentric characters. The protagonist, Sheriff Hawkins (played by the charismatic Johnny Ravework), is a multilayered and complex individual. He's a young, battle-ready Vietnam War vet that aptly embraces the role of a local town hero in the wake of the alien invasion. Opposite Hawkins is the enigmatic and feisty Astrid (played by the equally magnetic Judy Stardrop), a brilliant scientist who comes to the rescue by deciphering the aliens' encrypted communication signals. Their undeniable on-screen chemistry serves as a strong emotional pillar throughout the narrative. The Alien Spacelings themselves are an interesting blend of imaginativeness and camp. Although their costumes are clearly nothing more than repurposed wetsuits discreetly covered with green and blue paint, the actors' enthusiastic efforts to portray these unhinged creatures add an undeniably refreshing and infectious energy to the film. These cosmic beings have traveled millions of light-years with only one goal in mind: to consume all the sugar available on Earth, as this sweet substance is crucial to the survival and evolution of their species. The plot of “Invasion of the Alien Spacelings” takes wild twists and turns, providing non-stop entertainment to the audience. In one memorable scene, the town's beloved baker, Granny Willows, triumphs over an Alien Spaceling with her powerful rolling pin. It's hilarious, campy moments like these that elevate the movie to new heights of B-movie glory. Moreover, the film's oddly infectious musical score, composed by Murray Synchroflux, ties the story together. An electrifying mix of theremin-infused orchestral themes and bopping jazz numbers creates an amusing, otherworldly auditory experience that leaves moviegoers tapping their feet in delight. In conclusion, “Invasion of the Alien Spacelings” is an outstanding, somewhat overlooked film that celebrates the creativity and originality of B-movies in the science fiction genre. With its iconic characters, cheesy special effects, and unforgettable twists, the film captures the essence of a thrilling adventure while never taking itself too seriously. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable ride into the unknown that leaves fans of vintage sci-fi clamoring for more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

His erstwhile title rival Vettel will be just as disappointed with second place. The 26-year-old was fastest after the first laps in the top 10 shoot-out but after Webber pipped him on the Australian's final run, Vettel failed to improve. Vettel flicked his head in frustration several times as he crossed the line after completing his final lap. Webber said: \\"This weekend has gone pretty smoothly. Not the smoothest path to the start of Q2 or Q1, we were not electric. We changed the car quite a bit and I got more and more comfortable as the session went on.

Write an article with the title: \\"All Russian athletes to be banned from Paralympic Games in Rio\\"","completion":"Title: All Russian athletes to be banned from Paralympic Games in Rio Introduction In a shocking turn of events that has sent waves of disappointment and disbelief throughout the international sports community, it has been announced that all Russian athletes will be banned from participating in the upcoming Paralympic Games in Rio. This decision has been reached following a series of investigations and findings that pointed to systematic, state-sponsored doping within the Russian sports system. Background The journey that led us to this point has been both tumultuous and difficult for all parties involved. Starting with the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games, there were widespread allegations of doping within the Russian sports system. These allegations prompted further investigations led by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which eventually led to the publication of the McLaren report. The McLaren report, released in July 2016, presented evidence of a widespread state-sponsored doping program within Russia. The investigation, carried out by Canadian lawyer and WADA investigator Richard McLaren, discovered several instances of cheating and deception within the Russian system. Among these instances were the swapping of urine samples to avoid positive tests, manipulation of doping test results, and the involvement of the Russian government in facilitating these activities. Decision-making process After the McLaren report, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) was left with a difficult decision. With the evidence laid out in front of them, the IPC had to come to terms with the fact that the Russian sports system had been systematically cheating the international sports community. In light of these findings, the IPC called for a complete ban of Russian Paralympic athletes from the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio. The IPC's decision was not made overnight. It took several rounds of debates and discussions before they finally reached a consensus. Amidst growing tensions and the stakes constantly rising, it was a decision that would change the course of the Paralympic Games forever. In the end, the IPC resolved to uphold and protect the integrity of the Paralympic movement, even if it meant excluding an entire nation from the competition. Support and backlash As expected, the IPC's decision to ban Russian athletes from the Paralympic Games was met with mixed reactions from various stakeholders within the international sports community. For some, the decision was applauded as a necessary step towards ensuring a fair and level playing field for athletes from around the world. The ban was seen as a clear message that no nation will be allowed to corrupt the Paralympic movement through cheating and deception. On the other hand, there were those who criticized the IPC's ruling as being overly strict and unjust. Russian sports authorities and government officials have consistently denied any involvement in the alleged state-sponsored doping program. They have decried the wholesale ban as collective punishment, claiming that innocent athletes will be unjustly denied the opportunity to compete on the biggest stage of their careers. Impact on the Paralympic Games and beyond The banning of all Russian athletes from the Rio Paralympic Games certainly taints the event with an undeniable air of controversy. The absence of Russian athletes will undoubtedly reshape the competitive landscape in Rio, opening up opportunities for other nations to claim medals that would otherwise have been contested by Russian Paralympians. However, the ban does not only affect the upcoming Paralympic Games but has far-reaching implications for the future of sports in Russia and the international sports community as a whole. The entire saga has highlighted the urgent need for a comprehensive overhaul of global anti-doping practices, as well as more robust systems for ensuring transparency and accountability among sports officials. Conclusion The banning of all Russian athletes from the Paralympic Games in Rio is a potent reminder of the importance of protecting the integrity of sports. While opinions remain divided about the fairness and severity of the ban, it is clear that the Paralympic movement, as well as the greater international sports community, must remain vigilant and take decisive action to root out doping and its corrosive effects on the spirit of fair competition. Only by doing so can we ensure a more just and equitable playing field for all athletes, regardless of their nationalities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After she awakens from one, she looks at her dream journal, which includes drawings detailing characters and events from the first film; during this, she recalls a vision that picks up immediately where the first film ended: after the Tall Man's minions attacked Mike through his bedroom mirror, Reggie heard the commotion and ran upstairs to his aid. He tried to get a shotgun, but was attacked by Lurkers and had to flee, although he managed to surreptitiously snuff the pilot lights on the stove. Once upstairs, he dodged the Tall Man and rescued Mike, and the two dove out of the bedroom window to escape as the gas fumes reached the living room fireplace and destroyed the house. Following this, Liz pleads for Mike to find her, as she fears that when her grandfather dies, the Tall Man will take him.Having been institutionalized as delusional since the first film, Mike feels he can no longer ignore Liz's dream pleas, and fakes his recovery to obtain a doctor's release.

In Syria, the opposition is not waiting for President Bashar al-Assad to fall. Anti-government activists in recent weeks have used a Google crowdsourcing program, Map Maker, to rename key streets, bridges and boulevards after their revolutionary heroes, according to opposition figures and the Syrian government. The idea, activists say, has been to expunge the vestiges of the Assad family’s 40-year rule and to commemorate protesters who have fallen over the course of an 11-month-old uprising. “They have the right to be remembered by the Syrians,” said Rwadan Ziadeh, a representative of the Syrian National Council, an exile group. “They are making new history.” On Google, names have changed over time as the maps are updated with user proposals, which are approved by other users as well as Google editors. The names on Google Maps are sometimes different from those on Google Earth. The overall result, however, has been a patchwork of Assad-era and revolutionary names, sometimes side by side. (GOOGLE EARTH IMAGE from JANUARY PROVIDED BY ogleearth.com/Last month, this major Damascus highway was identified on Google Earth as being named after Hafez al-Assad, the father of Syria’s current president, and Ibrahim al-Kashosh, an icon of the current uprising. ) The campaign started a couple of months ago on Facebook, said Rami Nakhle, another exile opposition figure, and it has quickly gained the Syrian government’s attention. On Monday, the country’s envoy to the United Nations, Bashar al-Jafaari, digressed from a speech before the General Assembly to accuse Google of participating in a foreign plot to meddle in Syria’s internal affairs and undermine its leader. “What does Google have to do with the names of streets in small Syrian cities and villages?” Jafaari said, referring to changed street names in the restive towns of Homs and Idlib. “This is a flagrant violation of United Nations General Assembly, the resolution of the Arab League pertaining to the standardization of the geographic nomenclature.” The renaming campaign hasn’t happened only online. On Syrian streets, members of the opposition have changed signs with their own hands. Ziadeh said activists in his home town, Daraya, tore down the sign on a street named after President Assad’s older brother, Basel al-Assad, who died in a car accident in 1994. In its place, they erected a sign honoring Ghiyath Matar, a 24-year-old tailor whose signature gesture — handing out flowers to Syrian soldiers — has come to symbolize the opposition movement’s nonviolent beginnings. Anti-government activists throughout the Middle East have effectively harnessed the power of the Internet, particularly social media, to fuel public support for their causes. Google, which employed Wael Ghonim, an early leader of the popular uprising that brought down Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, has emerged as a particularly high-profile symbol of the forces of tumult. The Internet giant declined to make someone available to discuss its mapping practices in detail. But spokeswoman Deanna Yick said Google has built its maps from “a wide range of authoritative sources, ranging from the public and commercial data providers, user contributions and imagery references. “Overall,” Yick said, “this provides a very comprehensive and up-to-date map, but maps are constantly changing along with the real world, so we’ll continue to review data and make changes as new information becomes available.” The effort to exploit the Internet has in some ways been more critical in Syria, where the government has imposed a tighter media blackout, than in other countries that have undergone upheaval during the Arab Spring. Protesters have hacked government Web sites, smuggled cellphone images outside the country showing evidence of the government crackdown, and run live streams from towns including Homs, where the United Nations asserts that more than 300 people have been killed in the past two weeks. Stefan Geens, author of the Ogle Earth blog, which tracks Google Maps, said the renaming of Syrian streets and other landmarks represents the latest front in efforts to use crowdsourcing to promote political views. In 2008, he said, Tunisian activists using Google Earth posted links to a YouTube video on top of the view of the presidential palace in Tunis. The video featured former political prisoners describing torture they suffered under the government. But Geens said Syria’s is the first uprising he knows of in which activists have used online mapping programs to rewrite history. He compared a Google map of the town of Latakia with a crowdsourced map produced by OpenStreetMap. Both showed 8 March Avenue, named for the date of the 1963 military coup that brought the Baath Party to power and installed Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad’s father, as president. But the Google map also carried the date March 15, an apparent reference to the official birth of the 2011 popular uprising in Syria. “It’s obvious this was crowdsourced. This is the risk of crowdsourcing: One could infiltrate and change names for political purposes,” Geens said. “I am absolutely convinced that this is not something intentional on Google’s part to subvert the authority of Assad.” The Syrian government might not be convinced. The U.N. diplomatic protest came several weeks after Damas Post, a Syrian government Web site, noted that a major Damascus highway was identified on Google Earth as being named after both Hafez al-Assad and Ibrahim al-Kashosh, another icon of the current uprising. On Tuesday morning, Assad’s name was nowhere to be seen. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain.

News article: Women allegedly held as slaves for 30 years in south London originally met their captors in a “collective” after meeting them through a “shared political ideology”, police have disclosed. Commander Steve Rodhouse, of Scotland Yard, also revealed the couple accused of holding the three women against their will were of Indian and Tanzanian origin, and came to live in Britain in the 1960s. The address where the women lived with their alleged captors has been revealed as a tidy three-storey council block in Peckford Place, Stockwell, south London. One neighbour said the elderly couple who lived at the address appeared to be \\"dominant\\" over the other occupants. It emerged earlier this week that the three victims - a 69 year-old Malaysian, a 57 year-old Irish woman and a British woman aged 30 - were rescued from the property last month and had been subjected to what police described as “emotional control” for decades. Neighbours expressed their shock and surprise at the drama which had unfolded in recent days at the flat on the Angel Town estate. One man said he had seen a woman in her 30s, who appeared to be of Indian origin, entering the house on two occasions in recent months. \\"She looked completely normal. She was wearing a headscarf and just went into the flat on the times I saw her,\\" said Jose Pereira, 54, a cook. One resident, who did not want to be named, described the occupants as an elderly Indian couple, a woman in her 30s and another woman of Indian appearance in her mid-50s. He said: \\"I thought the elderly couple were looking after the others, as if they were carers, but there was something strange about it all. \\"The older couple were definitely the ones in charge, they were the dominant ones, you could tell that. \\"The young girl was very quiet and would not say very much. She was very pretty. I have to say the older couple were very polite.\\" Another resident, who would only give her name as Sophie, described how she spotted one of the women being pushed in a wheelchair by another of the occupants of the house three weeks ago. Mr Rodhouse said officers were beginning house-to-house inquiries nearby in a bid to learn more about the extraordinary incident. Mr Rodhouse said: “The suspects are of Indian and Tanzanian origin that came to the UK in the 1960s. “We believe that two of the victims met the male suspect in London through a shared political ideology, and that they lived together at an address that you could effectively call a ‘collective’. “Somehow that collective came to an end and how the women ended up continuing to live with the suspects. “How this resulted in the women living in this way for over 30 years is what are seeking to establish, but we believe emotional and physical abuse has been a feature of all the victims’ lives. “The people involved, the nature of that collective and how it operated is all subject to our investigation and we are slowly and painstakingly piecing together more information. I will not give any further information about it.” Mr Rodhouse revealed the younger of the three victims had a birth certificate but added: “That is all the official documentation we can find.” Officers believe the 30 year-old woman has lived with the suspects and the other victims all her life. The rescue was staged after the 57 year-old woman secretly gained access to a telephone and contacted Freedom Charity, which works with victims of enforced labour. She first contacted them on 18 October and following negotiations over a week, the three women left the property on October 25 when the occupants of the house were out. They were moved to a safe location where they have been receiving specialist help. It is not yet known if they are related. On Thursday the alleged captors, both aged 67, were arrested and questioned but have since been released on bail until January. Mr Rodhouse said no-one had reported the three victims missing to police between they day they left the house and the day of the arrests. He added: “I understand the huge public interest in this case, the desire for information and the shock that it has caused. “However, we must take every step to protect the identities of the victims who are understandably emotionally fragile and highly vulnerable. “For that reason will not provide any information that will lead to the identification of the suspects or these women that require our every effort to protect them.” A Aneeta Prem of Freedom Charity Earlier, police said the women had been \\"brainwashed\\" because of the fear instilled in them by their captors, and were held by \\"invisible handcuffs\\". At the Angel Town estate Sara Habtemichael, 41, a mother-of-three, said: \\"It's so very sad what seems to have happened there. \\"Can you imagine what was going on? I've lived here for five years and never really noticed the people who lived at that address. \\"When I first heard about it on th news I coudl never have imagined it would be opposite where I live. it's just awful.\\" Another resident, Peter Nosike, 37, said: \\"It seems almost impossible that something like this could happen here. It's just shocking. \\"I know most of the people who live on this block but I've never noticed the people who lived there, which is strange because it's quite open on the estate and we all overlook each other.\\" Aneeta Prem, founder of the Freedom Charity, said: “We have seen an extraordinary rise in calls to our helpline since the rescue of the three women came into the public domain. “We received five times as many calls in 24 hours as we normally do in one week and are needing to increase our resources to cope with this extra demand. “These women have had traumatic and disturbing experiences, which they have revealed to us. “What needs to happen now is that the three victims, who have begun a long process of recovery, are able to go through their rehabilitation undisturbed, without being identified.” ||||| Police are examining whether three women who were held in a south London house under what detectives described as extreme emotional control for 30 years were part of a cult which operated through beatings and brainwashing to bind them to their captors. The complex relationship between the women and the couple who are suspected of exerting such influence over them that in three decades they never tried to leave, is at the centre of what senior officers indicated on Friday was going to be a lengthy inquiry. Officers are also investigating whether the youngest woman, who is aged 30 and thought to have been born inside the house, was the daughter of the 57-year-old Irish woman who eventually reached out for help last month in a phone call to a charity she had seen on the news. The Guardian understands the 30-year-old's father is allegedly the 67-year-old man who was arrested with his partner, also 67, on suspicion of domestic servitude, false imprisonment and offences against the person. On Friday, both were released on police bail after questioning. According to those close to the case, the 30-year-old's birth was registered with the authorities and as such should have sparked visits from health visitors and midwives, but it is not known whether that happened. She never went to school, but is able to read and write, and has been described as intelligent. Two sources close to the case indicated that the three women were held in the house through a relationship of control which was akin to a semi-religious cult. The third woman freed was a 69-year-old from Malaysia. The police revealed on Friday that the details emerging were unlike any domestic servitude or forced labour case they had investigated before. The women were able to leave at certain times, but always in a controlled and chaperoned situation. Commander Steve Rodhouse, of the Metropolitan police, said: \\"We do not believe that this case falls into the category of sexual exploitation, or what we all understand as human trafficking. \\"It is not as brutally obvious as women being physically restrained inside an address and not allowed to leave. We are trying to understand what were the invisible handcuffs that were used to exert such a degree of control over these women … What we have uncovered so far is a complicated and disturbing picture of emotional control over many years, brainwashing would be the simplest term.\\" His colleague DI Kevin Hyland said the women suffered beatings in the house. Aneeta Prem, founder of the Freedom Charity, which helped rescue the women, said they lived in basic conditions. \\"Their movements were controlled while they were in the house. They had to perform various duties within the house and they weren't given options not to do those things.\\" Rodhouse also revealed that the suspects – who are being investigated by the UK Border Agency over their immigration status – were arrested by the Metropolitan police four decades ago and may have been in touch with other public services over the years. He said: \\"To the outside world, they may have appeared to be a normal family. This does mean that over the course of many decades the people at the heart of this investigation and their victims will probably have come into contact with public services, including our own.\\" He added that the two suspects \\"were arrested by the Metropolitan police in the 1970s\\". The women were being looked after by the Freedom Charity – which helped to rescue them after the Irish woman made a call for help on 18 October after seeing the founder on the television news. On 25 October, they walked to freedom at a pre-arranged time. Prem said the organisation had received calls from other people saying they were being held. \\"This has to be a story of hope. A number of calls are coming through from people who have seen the media coverage and want to tell us they are in the same situation,\\" she said. One report suggested that it was the failure to call for medical help when the oldest woman suffered a stroke that led to the call to the charity. Hyland, who is leading the investigation, said the very process of the women explaining what had happened over such a long period of time was traumatising in itself. He added that the whole of his team of 37 officers were working on the case and removed 55 bags of evidence amounting to more than 2,500 exhibits from the property in south London. Prem, who has met the women several times, said that the couple suspected of holding them were like any other couple and were not extraordinary. As such she believes the neighbours didn't know. \\"If you'd been in a village maybe this wouldn't have happened because people would have noticed something, but I think in the centre of London you don't notice.\\" The women are understood to be concerned that the suspects have been released without charge on police bail. But Rodhouse said the investigation would take \\"some considerable time\\". He said: \\"We are unpicking a story that spans at least 30 years of these women's lives, and all of this requires police activity to turn that into evidence. While that process continues we have released the suspects on bail, but they have not returned to the property.\\" A CPS spokesperson said: \\"We have provided the Metropolitan Police Service with some very early investigative advice on this matter. We have not been asked to consider any evidence or to give charging advice at this stage.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Three women, aged 69, 57, and 30, were allegedly held as slaves in south London for 30 years. The women, hailing from Malaysia, Ireland, and Britain, respectively, were originally introduced to their captors through a shared political ideology and have since lived under their emotional control. The accused are an Indian and Tanzanian couple that migrated to the UK in the 1960s. The victims resided with their alleged captors in a three-storey council block in Peckford Place, Stockwell. The women endured what police described as extreme brainwashing and emotional coercion, tied to them in a manner akin to an obscure kind of cult, bound by \\"invisible handcuffs\\". The women were permitted to leave the house only in a controlled and supervised manner. Officers characterised this case as unique as it doesn't typically align with standard cases of human trafficking or sexual exploitation. The youngest victim, a British native, had lived with the suspects all her life and is believed to be the daughter of the 57-year-old Irish woman. She was born in the house and never attended school, although she can read and write. The rescue was made possible following a call from the Irish woman to the Freedom Charity, a charity working with victims of forced labour. Post-negotiations, the victims were released from the property and are currently receiving unique care and support at an undisclosed location while officers continue their investigation. The suspects in question were arrested and questioned, but have been released on bail until January. The authorities are slowly but steadily gathering more information about the case, being cautious to protect the victims' identities due to their vulnerable and highly sensitive emotional state."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For Hayek, the supposedly stark difference between authoritarianism and totalitarianism has much importance and Hayek places heavy weight on this distinction in his defence of transitional dictatorship.

In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \\"totalitarianism with authoritarianism,\\" and said that he was unaware of \\"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Trudeau to be questioned over reports of fundraisers offering privileged access Justin Trudeau will be questioned by Canada’s ethics watchdog over reports of political fundraisers that allegedly offered privileged access to the prime minister and his cabinet ministers for a price. The development marks the first time in a decade that the ethics commissioner has questioned a sitting prime minister and is a turning point for Trudeau who swept to a majority government last year on broad promises to run a transparent administration that would abide by the highest standards of ethics. The scandal began brewing in October, after a series of media reports documented Liberal party fundraisers being held in the homes of wealthy Canadians and which offered access to members of Trudeau’s government for up to C1,500 (1,100) a ticket. The reports raised questions of whether the government was opening itself up to behind-the-scenes lobbying, such as a report by the Globe and Mail that quoted a British Columbia multimillionaire who said he had urged the prime minister to allow Chinese investment in senior care and real estate development just as the government was reviewing a bid by a China-based company to purchase a majority stake in one of British Columbia’s largest chains of retirement homes. The allegations, which have left Trudeau and his government fending off daily accusations of wrongdoing, triggered complaints to the ethics commissioner from the opposition Conservatives and the New Democratic party. Responding to the complaint from the Conservatives, Mary Dawson, Canada’s ethics commissioner said in a letter on Thursday that while there is no evidence to date to suggest that Trudeau violated the country’s conflict of interest act, she would query Trudeau over his involvement with the fundraising events. A copy of the letter was provided to the Guardian. Addressed to interim Conservative leader, Rona Ambrose, the letter noted Dawson’s unease over the issue. “While the information provided in support of the allegations is not sufficient to cause me to initiate an examination under the act at this time, your letter and media articles leave me with concerns in relation to Mr Trudeau’s interactions with individuals involved with the canola export agreement, Wealth One Bank and Anbang Insurance Group,” Dawson wrote. No timeline was given as to when she would question Trudeau. A spokesperson for the ethics commissioner confirmed that Dawson is looking into the matter and noted that it is the usual practice of the commissioner to follow up with questioning when the office receives a letter containing allegations. Based on the answers provided by the prime minister, the ethics commissioner will then determine whether a full-scale investigation should be launched. In late October, Canada’s lobbying commissioner announced it would launch an investigation into the fundraisers in order to determine whether any of the government rules around lobbying had been breached. The allegations of trading cash for access have come as a blow to Trudeau, as they appear to contradict accountability rules issued by the prime minister after his government came into power last year. The rules, which aim to go one step further than the fundraising rules that ban corporate and union donations and limit individual donations to a maximum of C1,500 annually, state “there should be no preferential access to government, or appearances of preferential access, accorded to individuals or organisations because they have made financial contributions to politicians and political parties”. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trudeau said he would work with the ethics commissioner to answer any questions she may have. “We have very strict rules on fundraising at the federal level and no one is suggesting that we are not following those rules. And that’s something that is important for Canadians to remember,” he said. “Our commitment is to show the highest level of ethical standards, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.” Earlier this week, Trudeau acknowledged that government business is discussed at the fundraisers – contrary to what officials from the Liberal party had previously told reporters – but insisted that donors have no special sway when it comes to government policy.","completion":"Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, is to be questioned by the national ethics watchdog over allegations of political fundraisers offering privileged access to Trudeau and his government. Liberal party fundraisers, reportedly held in the homes of wealthy Canadians, were said to offer privileged access at 1,100 a ticket. The allegations come in the wake of media coverage of behind-the-scenes lobbying for Chinese investment in senior care and real estate development by a British Columbia multi-millionaire. Mary Dawson, the Canadian ethics commissioner, said she would question Trudeau over his involvement with fundraising events, though she confirmed there was no evidence to suggest he had violated the country's Conflict of Interest Act. No date has been given for the interrogation, which the ethics commissioner will use to ascertain whether a full-scale investigation is necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: a ) 11 , b ) 12 , c ) 17 , d ) 19 , e ) 21","completion":"To solve this problem, follow these simple steps: Step 1: Understand the problem The original class has an average age of 40 years, and 12 new students join the class with an average age of 32 years. This change causes the overall average age to decrease by 4 years. We need to find the original number of students in the class. Step 2: Set up the equation Let x be the original number of students in the class, and let T be the total age of all students in the original class. The average age is calculated by dividing the total age by the number of students. Therefore: Original average age = T / x = 40 Step 3: Use the information provided in the problem When 12 new students join the class with an average age of 32 years, the total age of all students becomes T + (12 * 32) and the total number of students becomes x + 12. The new average age will be 4 years less than the original average, so: New average age = (T + 12 * 32) / (x + 12) = 40 - 4 = 36 Step 4: Solve the equation Now we have two equations: (1) T / x = 40 (2) (T + 12 * 32) / (x + 12) = 36 First, solve equation (1) for T: T = 40*x Now substitute this into equation (2): (40*x + 12 * 32) / (x + 12) = 36 Simplify the equation and solve for x: 40x + 384 = 36x + 432 4x = 48 x = 12 Step 5: Identify the answer The original strength of the class was: x = 12 (Option b) So the correct answer is option b) 12."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Bees will begin to chew max until it becomes softened - The chewed up wax will be stored inside of a honeycomb - Worker bees continue chewing and softening wax from within - The chewed up wax is steadily added, making the hive bigger and bigger - The bees will house nectar, honey and pollen within the honeycomb's cells - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of this process is the collection of raw materials by the worker bees to produce the wax required for building and expanding the honeycomb structure. This begins with the foraging worker bees venturing out from the hive in search of nectar-rich flowers. While foraging, these worker bees also collect pollen from the flowers, which is an essential protein source for the colony. The nectar, on the other hand, is their primary source of carbohydrates, providing them with the necessary energy for their various activities within and outside of the hive. Upon ingesting the nectar, the sugar it contains is converted by enzymes into a substance called bee bread, which is stored in their honey stomachs. As the bees continue to collect nectar and consume it, their bodies begin to produce wax from special glands located on the underside of their abdomen. These glands secrete tiny wax flakes, which protrude from the surface of the bee's body and can be easily removed by the worker bees. It is this raw wax material that becomes the essential building block for constructing and enlarging the honeycomb structure within the hive. Thus, the foraging and collection of nectar by worker bees, combined with the secretion and processing of this raw material into usable wax, serve as the critical first steps in the honeycomb building process. This task plays a vital role in the colony's health, organization, and overall survival, as the honeycomb is used not only for storing nectar, honey, and pollen but also for housing their young and providing protection for the queen bee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last names of the band members in the passage that didn't have trouble with deportation? from the following article ? Koschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the district into music venues, and he initially placed the Beatles at the Indra Club. After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.During the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the \\"exi\\" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles. When Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany, McCartney took up the bass. Producer Bert Kaempfert contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as Tony Sheridan's backing band on a series of recordings for Polydor Records.

As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA. After reading the above, is \\"Because to be denied to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to oppose justice\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Why should Barnes' frequent volunteering with the Atlanta Legal Aid Society not be viewed as rare?\\"?

What is the most logical next event? How to select paprika Look for paprika in supermarkets, gourmet grocery stores and stores specialising in spices and herbs. It is also possible to purchase it online. Select paprika in good condition. Available choices: (a). In the fridge, rub some paprika on your hands. Be sure to dry your hands before eating it. (b). Check the appearance of the cloves. Fresh cloves develop a greenish appearance and may look bitter or rotten. (c). Paprika should be : In date ground finely and evenly shiny in colour and consistent Choose paprika according to your recipe needs. Paprika is available in various styles, including smoked. (d). Although paprika is a natural spice, it's not healthy for humans; the oils will cause serious illnesses. Look for even better quality paprika than what is advertised on market-bought soups or casseroles.","completion":"(c). Paprika should be: In date, ground finely and evenly, shiny in colour, and consistent. Choose paprika according to your recipe needs. Paprika is available in various styles, including smoked. When selecting the most appropriate paprika for your needs, it's essential to consider not only the quality of the spice but also its specific characteristics. Paprika is a ground spice made from dried bell peppers and chili peppers, and it comes in various forms, primarily sweet, hot, or smoked. Each type imparts distinct flavors and properties, so it's crucial to select the right variety for your recipe. First and foremost, always check the expiration date on the packaging. Spices do not last forever and gradually lose their potency and flavor profile over time, which means that using an expired product may impact the taste of your dish. Ground paprika should be fine and evenly textured. This ensures that the spice will mix well with other ingredients, preventing clumping and allowing the flavors to blend smoothly. A consistent, fine grind also indicates proper processing and contributes to an even distribution of flavor. The colour of the paprika should be shiny and consistent throughout, indicating that it has not been exposed to excessive light, heat, or humidity, which can cause the spice to deteriorate and lose its flavor. Paprika naturally has a vibrant red hue, and a shiny, even coloration showcases its freshness and intensity. To make the most appropriate choice for your recipe, consider the different styles of paprika available. Sweet paprika is the most common variety, offering mild, slightly sweet flavor notes. Hot paprika, as its name suggests, is spicier and may be more appropriate for recipes that require a touch of heat. Smoked paprika is another option; it is made by smoking the peppers before drying and grinding them, adding a deep, smoky flavor profile that pairs well with hearty dishes and meats. In summary, to select the best suitable paprika for your culinary needs, always verify the expiration date, ensure the ground consistency and vibrant color, and choose the specific type – sweet, hot, or smoked – that aligns with the desired taste and characteristics of your dish. By doing so, you'll maximize the flavor, aroma, and overall enjoyment of your culinary creation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour.

Given the following passage \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian.

Question: Where is Von Stein caught by Officer Gast? Movie title: The Third Generation Movie plot: P.J. Lurz, an industrialist with an office in a Berlin high-rise, informs his American headquarters that the company has difficulty selling its security-related computer systems to the West German government in Bonn. Nevertheless Lurz has hatched a secret plan to boost sales. Meanwhile Susanne, Lurzâs secretary, receives a phone call with the message: The world as will and idea. This is a code phrase among a secret group of thirty-something middle-class leftists and would-be terrorists to which she belongs. The phrase has been taken from the central work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation. With these words, Susanne sets an ambiguous covert plot into motion, alerting the members of the terrorist cell of an upcoming meeting. They are: August Brem, the ringleader; Susanne's composer husband Edgar; feminist history professor Hilde Krieger; Petra Vielhabor, a housewife who is constantly arguing with her banker husband Hans; and Rudolf Mann, a clerk in a record store. P.J. Lurz is informed by Gerhard Gast, the inspector-general of the police, that he is being watched and is under police protection. Gast has also arrived to pick up Susanne, his daughter-in-law. En route to their home, Susanne and Gerhard stop at a hotel room and have sex. They have been carrying on an affair with sado-masochistic undertones. The Gast family has dinner together: Gerhardt, Susanne, her husband Edgar, the caustic grandfather, the delusional pianist grandmother and the young coupleâs small son. During dinner Grandpa Gast tells Edgar that every generation needs a war. The terrorists gather at Rudolfâs large apartment, but August is annoyed by the presence of Rudolfâs roommate Ilse Hoffman, a drug addict. August sees her as a threat to their secret activities.

However, considering the context provided, if you meant to ask about how the characters and their activities are caught by Officer Gast, here's what happens: Officer Gast, being the inspector-general of the police, learns about the secret group of middle-class leftists and their plot. He's in a unique position since he is having an affair with Susanne, who is a part of the terrorist cell. Throughout the movie, Gast keeps a close eye on their activities and the secret group. Towards the end of the movie, the group kidnaps an industrialist, Peter Lurz, but ends up releasing him. The police, led by Officer Gast, become even more aware of the terrorists' activities and follow the group closely. Eventually, the police capture and arrest the members of the terrorist cell, foiling their plans. Officer Gast's role in the movie is complex, as he is personally involved with Susanne and is aware of the group's actions but still takes an active part in dismantling their activities and capturing the members."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body. It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better.

Three years ago, the residents of Galena, in Alaska, were forced to abandon their homes when the Yukon River flooded the town. The Alaska Air National Guard and the National Army Guard evacuated around 300 residents from the surrounding area, many of whom eventually returned to find their homes no longer suitable for habitation. Since then, the town has been rebuilt and one of the residents, Adriana Hevezi, invited British photographer Ed Gold to document the re-formed community having seen his book, Wales: Portrait of an Alaska Village at a friend's house in Fairbanks. Gold took up the challenge and set off to reach the Alaskan community. One of the first pictures Gold took was of the funeral of long-time Galena resident Sidney Huntingdon, whose casket was taken on sledges behind snow machines along the frozen Yukon River to the cemetery. Gold spent more than six weeks in Galena, which is just 80 miles (130km) from the Arctic Circle, from late 2015 to early 2016, shooting on film. He chose to use a 35mm Contax II camera made in the mid-1930s and a Polaroid Pathfinder 110A from the mid-1950s, and found himself constantly battling with the effects of cold weather on equipment and film stock. While there, Gold found himself helping residents search for Andrew Henry, of Ruby, who had gone through the ice on the Yukon River while travelling between Ruby and Galena. His body has not been recovered. Gold's portraits capture some of the residents, along with their personal history. I came to Alaska in 1986 to look for work, any kind of work. There was a depression in Washington State so I came up here. I got sucked into adventuring straightaway so didn't do any work. Me and a good friend drove to Eagle. We had no money and ran out of everything but we built a raft and travelled down the Yukon River to Galena. The raft was 24ft long with a gas stove, a little house on it with a chicken coop and two chickens. We had hundreds of pounds of rice and beans but eventually we ran out. We'd stop at villages and hang out and let the chickens get used to land. My girlfriend was pregnant and we asked for work along the way. Everyone said go to Galena as we'd find work there. We got here, jumped off the raft - I had already drawn up a sign saying \\"looking for work\\" and I put it in the liquor store. Within an hour, I had got work and I have been here ever since. This house was built in 1971 by Jenie Olson, a teacher out here and it was raised about 3ft after the flood in 2013. The water was literally on my carpet. We bought it as an abandoned house in 1994. It's just one bedroom, it had been vandalised by kids, written all over the walls. One of the main reasons I've stayed is I have really great people who I work with. It's a great community - if you're in need they'll have a raffle for you and can raise over 5,000 in a night. There's about 450 people here right now. To live here, you need to be versatile, self-starters, self-entertainers. Hunting and trapping is right out your back door. Over the years, I have gotten to the stage where the dark and the cold in the winters has really gotten to me. It's a great place to save money as there are no stores to spend but other items are twice as expensive so you have to tighten your belt. When the river decided to flood, that was the day change was beckoned. My Mom was up here and she asked me to come up to help her out. She bought me a ticket. I told my boss and girlfriend I was going for a week. I saw a few weird things when I arrived like large icebergs on the side of the road and cars flipped over. On the flight up, a guy asked what I can do and he offered me a job there and then for 25 an hour. I helped my Mom and a lot of others out and decided that moving to Galena was a good idea. My girlfriend moved up with me. Everyone's a one-off here. When you go outside you don't know what you're going to find. In the city, if you look at how people get their endorphins, they are totally entertainment-based from an iPhone or an arcade. Living here instils values within you which are useful to have in the first world, like survival. I've learned how much more there is to learn about bush living but I don't want to be here forever. I have a Ducati motorbike I want to travel on and I want to go base- jumping in other countries. There's no billboards or adverts here. I think that the luxuries that people have come to expect are not sustainable here. A lot of things that are important become secondary concerns, like what to eat and where to get shelter. In the bush, we just get things done. This is the last structure on the last road out of town for hundreds of miles. It's right on the edge of town, to untouched wilderness. I was born in Nulato in 1927 and was adopted right after I was born. I never knew who my real parents were until I was nine years old. I was on my way to school then my cousin, John Henry, ran up to me and said you have two moms and two dads. I got into a fight with him and pushed him then ran home. I told my stepmom and on the way to school the next day he said it again and that's how I found out. Once in a great while I'd see my parents but not stay with them. In 1940, I went to Catholic school in Holy Cross for seven years. From Holy Cross, I went to Bethel and I got married and I didn't come home for 36 years. I had 14 children. Only six are still living. When I came home I had nothing and was lucky to get a job cleaning rooms at the firefighting department. I was divorced by then. I have 103 grandchildren. They're all scattered all the way down the coast to Anchorage and I have two or three great-great-great grand baby girls. I come from the Tanana village on the Yukon River, Alaska. My dad, Sidney, was half white and half Athabascan, his dad was all white - a miner from New York. My mother, Angela, is full Athabascan. When I was 12, I'd watch the dog sledding on a TV and in 1972 I was a helper and handler for Carl, my brother, at the start of the Iditarod Great Sled Race at Anchorage town, a race he won in 1974. I decided to try mushing eight years ago and I am the first deaf musher. I plan on going to college, to do something in the medical field as I like to help people. My grandmother made my kuspuk [hooded top] this past summer, she does a lot of sewing. My mukluks [boots] have seal skin bottoms and are made from hide and beaver. My grandma got them for me and I've had them for two years, I wear them a lot to potlatches [traditional feasts] and cultural days at school. The log cabin has been abandoned for as long as I can remember. It's run-down inside with old possessions lying around. I went inside because I was just curious, it was kind of spooky in a way, I felt like I shouldn't touch anything. I have had this bicycle of over 20 years and, apart from my parents, this is the second longest relationship I've had with anything. That's more or less true, I do have a sister also who qualifies as a longer relationship. It was purchased in 1997 near my home town of St Charles, Illinois. I bought it at a time when me and my friends were interested in long-distance bicycle trips. I call my gloves \\"loose dogs\\" because there have been incidents when I have been wearing these mitts and dogs have run up and acted aggressively towards my gloves thinking that perhaps they are two dogs wanting to play. Extreme cold plunge mitts are critical gear for me. Being functional here is all about having the right gear and having the right attitude. I wear a thin-lined glove under them and they're usually too warm. Mentally it gives you a feeling that you have a fighting chance with these, that I will not get frostbite. I started the retail hardware part of it in late 2012 and I'm just guessing I have about 20,000 items for sale in this store.

I sell these knives for processing fish and game. The bullets are .22 calibre. Their main purpose is for harvesting small game - upland grouse, spruce land grouse and ruffed grouse. I'm a hunter and trapper and started when I was nine years old in Iowa. Not that many people trap anymore. I think that 5,000 are licensed in the whole of Alaska.

What we can infer from the statements made by Marc Kasowitz, President Trump's personal lawyer, is that there might be some tension between him and the media. He accuses James Comey of leaking privileged information and points out the discrepancy between the dates of the New York Times quoting the memos and Comey's claim of leaking them in response to a tweet. This could suggest that Kasowitz is trying to discredit the media's use of leaked information, which may hint at a strained relationship between him and the press.

If \\"A child in a care bears blanket\\", does it logically follow that \\"A child wraps a care bears blanket around its body.\\"?","completion":"To determine if the statement \\"A child in a Care Bears blanket\\" logically follows that \\"A child wraps a Care Bears blanket around its body,\\" let's analyze step-by-step: 1. Understand the statements: The first statement (\\"A child in a Care Bears blanket\\") indicates that there is a child and that the child is somehow within the confines of a Care Bears blanket. The second statement (\\"A child wraps a Care Bears blanket around its body\\") describes the action of a child wrapping the Care Bears blanket around their body. 2. Determine the relationship between the statements: The first statement does not specify how the child is in the Care Bears blanket, whether wrapped, covered, or just touching it. The second statement specifies a particular action - that the child wraps the blanket around their body. 3. Evaluate if the first statement logically follows the second: Since the first statement does not provide enough information about the child's interaction with the Care Bears blanket, we cannot conclude that the child wraps the blanket around their body based solely on the knowledge that the child is \\"in\\" the blanket. It's possible, but other scenarios could also apply, such as the child lying on top of the blanket or being covered by the blanket without wrapping it around their body. 4. Conclusion: It does not logically follow that \\"A child in a Care Bears blanket\\" means \\"A child wraps a Care Bears blanket around its body.\\" There is not enough information available in the first statement to conclude the specific action of wrapping the blanket around the child's body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: There's no point in clicking below, as he has not comment. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To analyze whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true, we need to understand the meaning and context of both sentences. Sentence 1: \\"Click below for his unctuous commentary on this.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is directing the reader or listener to access a presumably insincere, overly sincere, or excessively flattering commentary made by someone referred to as \\"he.\\" The term \\"unctuous\\" implies that the commentary is likely to be disingenuous or smarmy. This sentence assumes that there is a commentary available for the reader or listener to access, and that this commentary is noteworthy for its insincere nature. Sentence 2: \\"There's no point in clicking below, as he has not comment.\\" This sentence is conveying that there is no purpose in following the instruction given in the first sentence; in this case, clicking below. The reason provided is that \\"he,\\" the person referred to in the first sentence, has not provided any commentary. The use of \\"not comment\\" could be a typo or grammatical error, as the correct phrasing would typically be \\"has not commented\\" or \\"has no comment.\\" Now, we will consider the possibility that the first sentence is true, and how it affects the truth of the second sentence. If Sentence 1 is true, it means that there is a commentary provided by \\"he,\\" which features an insincere tone. In this situation, the second sentence's claim that \\"he has not comment\\" would be false because the first sentence has established the presence of a commentary. As a result, the assertion that there is \\"no point in clicking below\\" would also be false, as there is, in fact, a commentary to access. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is not true. The two sentences present conflicting information; one stating that commentary exists, while the other denies its existence. With the first sentence being true, we can conclude that the second sentence is false in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Compare the main subjects and the timeframes: - Both sentences mention \\"Since March 11\\" - the timeframes are the same. - Both sentences discuss the market's major indices/indexes - the subjects are the same. 2. Compare the events described and their contexts: - Both sentences talk about the lowest levels since hitting multi-year/multiyear lows in October - the events and context are the same. - Both sentences mention the tech-laden Nasdaq as the relevant index - the index in focus is the same. 3. Compare the outcomes: - Both sentences state that the Nasdaq has climbed nearly 20 per cent/percent - the outcome is the same. The only differences in the sentences are the slight variations in the words used (indices vs indexes, multi-year vs multiyear, per cent vs percent).

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart the water - The water breakes into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons - Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into NADPH - Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis - A:","completion":"The missing first step in the process is the absorption of sunlight by the chlorophyll and other accessory pigments present within the chloroplasts of the plant cells. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. It plays a critical role in supporting life on Earth, as it is the primary source of oxygen and organic compounds required for various organisms, including humans. Here is a more detailed and complete sequence of events in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis: 1. Absorption of light: The process begins when chlorophyll and accessory pigments (such as carotenoids and phycobiliproteins) in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts absorb photons from sunlight. This excites the electrons in the pigments to a higher energy state, initiating the photosynthetic process. 2. Excitation of electrons and formation of a high-energy species: The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart water molecules (H2O) through a process known as photolysis. This step is crucial as it provides the necessary electrons, hydrogen ions (protons), and oxygen molecules needed for the subsequent reactions. 3. Generation of oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons: As you mentioned, the water breaks into oxygen (O2), hydrogen (H2), and electrons. The oxygen produced diffuses out of the plant as a waste product, which is vital for the survival of aerobic organisms. 4. Electron transport chain and generation of ATP: The energized electrons are passed along a series of proteins called the electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane. As the electrons move through this chain, they release energy that helps to pump protons across the membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient ultimately drives the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), an essential energy molecule for the plant and other living organisms. 5. Formation of NADPH: Finally, hydrogen ions and the energized electrons are used to convert NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) into NADPH, a high-energy electron carrier molecule. NADPH plays a critical role in the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) of photosynthesis, where it helps convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into glucose (C6H12O6). In summary, the missing first step of the process is the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll and accessory pigments, which excites electrons and initiates the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions produce oxygen as a waste product, ATP as an energy source, and NADPH as an electron carrier, all of which contribute to the overall process of photosynthesis and sustenance of life on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Why Student Athletes Continue To Fail Seventy-four college underclassmen have been declared eligible for the NFL’s upcoming draft, but Ohio State’s quarterback Cardale Jones won’t be among them. A few days after winning the national championship game in January, Jones shocked fans and football analysts by saying he wasn’t ready to go pro, that it was important for him to graduate from college first. What made the announcement all the more surprising, beyond the fact that Jones may never again be as desirable an NFL prospect as he is the year he won a national championship, was that his previous claim to fame was a notorious tweet posted two years ago in which he complained about the “college” part of being a college football player. He wrote that he’d gone to Ohio State to play football, not “to play school,” and that classes were pointless. Jones now regrets and disavows that tweet. Earlier this month, he was tweeting that nothing is more important than education, under the hashtag “StudentBeforeAthlete.” It’s hard to know how sincere his attitude adjustment has been, or how sincere his initial dismissal of academics was. What is clear is that Jones and his conversion represent a messaging coup for his university and for the NCAA, which has maintained for decades that its primary goal is to help scholar-athletes receive an education that would prepare them for life beyond sports. Despite the NCAA’s insistence that it is concerned about student athletes’ academic growth, it often feels as though “student” plays second fiddle to “athlete.” Indeed, on a typical day, a visitor to the NCAA homepage will be overwhelmed by the articles (and videos) about athletics but will not find a single article (or video) about the academic achievements of the athletes. This also seems to hold true for many of the NCAA’s member schools. The University of North Carolina and Syracuse are just two of the most recent universities to be under the spotlight for academic scandals involving student athletes. UNC offered a “no show” class for student athletes (where students received grades for phantom classes that they didn’t attend), and Syracuse allowed academically ineligible athletes to compete. And while these cases are the ones currently grabbing headlines, they are hardly unique; The Chronicle of Higher Education is reporting that 20 additional schools are being investigated for academic fraud. And what about the student athletes themselves? Student-athletes tend to take easier classes and get lower grades than non-athletes. This is not only true for schools from power conferences in big-money sports, it has been observed in Division III liberal arts colleges and Ivy League schools, neither of which even offer athletic scholarships. It’s tempting to believe that student athletes care only about their sport, and not about their schoolwork, as many popular commentators have suggested – and as Ohio State’s Jones once tweeted — except that in the dozen years that I’ve been teaching in university settings, that hasn’t been my experience at all. I’ve taught hundreds of Division 1 student athletes at several different schools, and they have been among the hardest working students I’ve encountered. The student athletes I’ve worked with have viewed their sport as a complement to, not a replacement for, their studies. My observations were hardly unique. One of my students, Josh Levine, ran a youth hockey clinic and was upset by the widespread perception that the students he worked with did not care about school. After several conversations about the issue, we decided that the only way to find out the truth was to run a study. And so we did, surveying 147 student athletes (including some still in high school) involved in various team sports from football and basketball to lacrosse and golf about how much both they and their teammates cared about sports and academics.” Here’s what we found: When student athletes were asked how much they care about athletics, they rated their interest a healthy 8.5 on average, on a scale of 1 to 10. But when asked the value they place on academics, the result was higher than 9 on average. If anything, the average student athlete cares more about his studies than his sport. #StudentBeforeAthlete indeed. So why do they underperform in their classes? One possible and intriguing reason suggested by our study is that student athletes don’t think their teammates take academics as seriously as they do. When asked to assess how much their teammates cared about athletics, the athletes were close, guessing 8.8. However, when asked to evaluate how much their teammates cared about academics, those same athletes guessed only 7.8 – far below the 9+ average. Why is this important? Because when an athlete thinks that the rest of the team doesn’t care about academics, that athlete tries to fit in by pretending not to care either. In a perverse form of peer pressure, Cardale Jones’s tweet about classes being worthless may be what student athletes tell each other in an effort to fit in, based on the mistaken belief that if they care about academics, they are in an uncool minority. All of this creates a distressing and self-perpetuating cycle. Tight-knit student athletes will seek ways of fitting into a culture that they perceive as neglecting academics (by defaulting into majors of dubious merit and spending less time doing homework), knowing that their habits are observed by teammates. When their teammates observe those habits, it reaffirms the (false) conviction that caring about academics is an unfortunate aberration, best suppressed. One of my co-authors on this project, Sara Etchison, has described this process particularly well: “There are student athletes who want to excel in the classroom, but think their teammates would judge them for it, so they study a little less, or take an easier major. And it turns out, that’s how virtually everyone on the team feels, but there’s never an opportunity to realize, ‘Oh wait, all of us really care about what’s happening on the academic side.’” This is a phenomenon that psychologists call “pluralistic ignorance” – when private preferences differ from perceptions of group norms. It leads people to engage in public behaviors that align more with the perceived norms than with their true preferences. The tragedy is that the norms are false – in reality, everybody would be happier if they just behaved in line with their true preferences. Pluralistic ignorance has also been shown to underlie the phenomenon of binge-drinking on campuses. A study conducted at Princeton University revealed that a majority of students who drink excessively did so not because they wanted to, but because they felt that was what their friends wanted to do. Once they all had a more accurate assessment of what the group norm was, the amount of alcohol consumed declined. This suggests that helping student athletes do better in the classroom may be as simple as letting them know that their teammates care as much about academics as they do. Many of them care deeply about the education they are receiving, and should care, because financial success in professional sports will elude the vast majority of them. As the NCAA and the media focus more attention on athletes’ academic performance, one of the best ways to improve the education of student athletes is to give them license to pursue their academic goals by making it clear that their teammates, and society as a whole, support them in their academic endeavors. For this to happen, we will need many more stars like Cardale Jones speaking out about the importance of education, instead of tweeting about the pointlessness of going to class. Daniel Oppenheimer is a professor of psychology and marketing at the Anderson School of Management at UCLA. He is the author of over 30 peer-reviewed journals, and several books, including Democracy Despite Itself: Why a System that Shouldn’t Work at All Works So Well. In addition to numerous awards for his teaching and research, he won the 2006 Ig Nobel science humor award. He wrote this for Zocalo Public Square.","completion":"This article talks about student athletes and their challenges in balancing school life and sports. Cardale Jones, a college football player, decided to graduate first before entering the professional league. Despite being very talented in the field, he chose to prioritize education over sports. Though there are other student athletes who feel pressured by their teammates to focus on sports and care less about academics, it is important to promote education as a priority. By supporting their academic goals and giving them the license to pursue it, we can improve the overall well-being of student athletes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A number of writers mentioned Bertin's eventful career, in tones that were, according to art historian Andrew Carrington Shelton, either \\"bitingly sarcastic [or] fawningly reverential\\". There were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years. Aware of Bertin's support of the July Monarchy, writers at the La Gazette de France viewed the portrait as the epitome of the \\"opportunism and cynicism\\" of the new regime. Their anonymous critic excitedly wondered \\"what bitter irony it expresses, what hardened skepticism, sarcasm and ... pronounced cynicism\\".Several critics mentioned Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century art historian Albert Boime described them as \\"powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled\\". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a \\"fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\\" Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: \\"A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature\\".The work's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited.

Jahrhunderts. Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German Erwin Panofsky's analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early Italian renaissance. Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler continued and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience.

Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose talent was recognized by an award of £100 from the British Institution in 1828? ? In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable...

Goalkeepers are allowed to handle the ball if the ball is played back to them by an action other than a kick or throw-in (such as a header), but defenders are not permitted to attempt to use a deliberate trick to pass the ball to the goalkeeper with a part of the body other than the foot to circumvent the rule. This would include flicking the ball up with the foot and then heading the ball back to the goalkeeper, or heading a ball on the ground that would otherwise be regularly playable with the foot. What's the best answer to this question: can a goalie pick up a back pass?

The other choices are not correct because they do not consider the specific situations in which a goalkeeper can handle the ball. In this case, a back pass is allowed as long as it is done in a way that follows the rules, like using the head instead of the foot."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, the meridian passes through Russia and Fiji as well as Antarctica. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys.

In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her. The narrating nurse probably believes that: - Connie was worth defending before she took action - not enough information - Connie will report the then impatient nurse for pouring cold water on her - Connie will come back one day to thank her The answer to this question is:","completion":"The narrating nurse likely believes that: 1. Connie was worth defending before she took action: The nurse felt empathy towards Connie and her situation, and recognized that Connie deserved to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of her condition. 2. Not enough information was provided about Connie's condition: The narrating nurse was a junior staff member and may not have had access to all of the details about Connie's medical history and diagnosis. This lack of information may have added to the mystery and intrigue of Connie's sudden recovery. 3. Connie might report the impatient nurse for treating her poorly: Since Connie regained her memory and cognitive abilities, she might remember the mistreatment she experienced at the hands of the impatient nurse and potentially report her actions to the hospital administration. 4. Connie could come back one day to express gratitude: The narrating nurse may hope that Connie, now recovered, might return to the hospital one day and express her appreciation for the support and kindness she received from the narrating nurse during her time at the ward. Ultimately, the narrating nurse probably felt a deep sense of satisfaction in standing up for Connie, and she may often ponder the impact of her actions and the potential repercussions for the impatient nurse who treated Connie poorly. Additionally, she might wonder about Connie's life outside the hospital and hope that she found happiness and fulfillment after her miraculous recovery."},{"prompt":"Question: What does Janine discover in Ben's pocket?

Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to harden off seedlings Stop adding water or fertilizer to the plants a week or 2 before you transplant seedlings to the outdoors. Place a small table under a tree or in another shady part of your outdoor space to harden off seedlings at first. Set plants outdoors on the table for an hour or 2 at the beginning of the hardening off process. Pick from: [a]. Put the plants outdoors during mid-day, when the sun is at its warmest. Protect the seedlings from wind with a wooden board.. [b]. After the skin on the plant overheats or becomes discolored, remove the plant for a little while. Cut back the seedlings in early summer after the first frost so that they won't be as brittle.. [c]. Wait for a frost if new leaf growth occurs after two or three days to then transplant pods. If you notice a frost forming on the plant, repot your seedlings and continue to plant them further after the last watering.. [d]. During this time, also plant seeds; your seeds should lay outside in a well-draining, care-packed mixture of wet leaves. Do not cut or re-plant any seedlings until after the first cloudy day..","completion":"[a]. Put the plants outdoors during mid-day, when the sun is at its warmest. Protect the seedlings from wind with a wooden board. Explanation: [b] is incorrect because it recommends removing the plants after overheating or discoloration, which are already signs of stress. It also recommends cutting back the seedlings after the first frost, which is not related to the hardening off process. [c] is incorrect because the statement is confusing and not relevant to the hardening off process. Waiting for frost before transplanting seedlings would actually be harmful to the plants. [d] is incorrect because it talks about planting seeds, which is not related to the hardening off process for seedlings. Also, cutting or re-planting seedlings after the first cloudy day is not a recommended practice for hardening off seedlings."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Mark Bailey didn't dream of becoming a judge. Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work. Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission. The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice. The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana. \\"This award came as a real surprise to me.

Vive le France? Not so for those earning more than 1.3 million a year, especially after Socialist President Francois Hollande announced he would introduce a top income tax rate of 75%. It has become a real point of contention, with some -- including top sports stars -- threatening to move abroad. Depardieu ditches France for Putin's Russia \\"I'm not surprised that they want to play there because it's the best league, but I am surprised by just how many French players have gone there at the same time,\\" former","completion":"France international and Tottenham Hotspur player David Ginola told CNN. The 75% income tax rate has certainly created waves throughout France, especially among the high-earning celebrities, business professionals, and athletes. This increase was aimed at fighting economic disparity and tackling the budget deficit. However, this decision has caused a significant number of wealthy individuals to rethink their residing situation. The French exodus towards countries with more lenient tax policies has gained significant attention due to the number of celebrities and star athletes who have chosen to leave. Gérard Depardieu, a prominent French actor, made headlines when he took up Russian citizenship in response to France's tax increase. Top sports stars have also been affected. Footballers, particularly those who sign with big French clubs like Paris Saint-Germain, are often paid salaries within a range that subjects them to the 75% tax rate. Players in other European countries generally have lower rates, such as 45% in England and 47% in Germany. The focus on French talent in foreign football leagues like the English Premier League has been intensified by these tax changes. In addition to the lure of reduced tax obligations, the English Premier League also offers international exposure and the potential for higher earnings from brand endorsements and sponsorships. Though France's affinity for football remains strong, players and teams are facing challenges due to the tax system. Major Parisian football clubs like Paris Saint-Germain have expressed concerns that this tax rate could prove detrimental to the development and competitiveness of their teams, ultimately hindering their ability to attract and retain top talent. Moreover, small businesses and entrepreneurs have been affected by this policy, as the considerable increase in taxation has led many to seek better opportunities elsewhere, such as in neighboring countries with more favorable economic climates. This trend could, in the long run, harm France's overall growth and innovation as promising new businesses choose to operate in other European countries. The top income tax rate of 75% has undoubtedly generated a wealth of discussion in France and beyond. While it has been praised by some for fostering a more equitable income distribution, it has also garnered criticism for spurring an exodus of high-income earners, entrepreneurs, and star athletes. Ultimately, the success of this policy will depend on its long-term impact on both the French economy and its ability to maintain its cultural and athletic prowess on the world stage. With an ongoing debate around the merits of such a tax rate, only time will tell whether this move by the French government will lead to growth or hinder their nation's economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? somewhat problematic","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"somewhat problematic\\" can be perceived as negative, given that it implies there are issues or challenges present. However, it is important to consider the context in which the sentence is used to determine its overall sentiment. In the given context, \\"problematic\\" has a negative connotation implying that something is causing problems, difficulties, or concerns. The modifier \\"somewhat\\" softens the negativity associated with the term \\"problematic,\\" making the overall sentiment less extreme. This might evoke a sense that while there is an issue, it might not be entirely negative or unsolvable. For example, consider the following sentences: 1. \\"The weather today is somewhat problematic for our picnic.\\" 2. \\"I found the instructions for the assignment to be somewhat problematic.\\" In both instances, the sentiment can be seen as negative because there are issues or concerns present. However, the word \\"somewhat\\" implies that there may be a degree of subjectivity in interpreting the extent of the problem, making the sentiment less negative than if the word \\"problematic\\" were used alone. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"somewhat problematic\\" is essentially negative due to the issues or challenges it suggests, but the use of \\"somewhat\\" makes it less intense. It is essential to consider the context in which the phrase is used to understand the overall sentiment more accurately."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We need to find the value of \\"p\\" that makes everything balance perfectly. Our equation looks like this: 347*p - 121*p - 731*p - 4582*p - 55957 = 0 First, we need to add and subtract all the parts with 'p' in them. Imagine these like your toy blocks, and we are putting the same type of blocks together. So let's do that: (347 - 121 - 731 - 4582) * p - 55957 = 0 Now let's do the math inside the parentheses (the numbers we need to add and subtract): (226 - 731 - 4582) * p - 55957 = 0 (-505 - 4582) * p - 55957 = 0 (-5087) * p - 55957 = 0 Now our equation looks like this: -5087*p - 55957 = 0 Next, we want to make this equation easier to solve by getting rid of the negative signs (like flipping our toy blocks to face the right way). We can do that by multiplying both sides of the equation by -1: 5087*p + 55957 = 0 Now, we want to get all the 'p' parts on one side and the number parts without 'p' on the other side, like separating the toy blocks into different groups: 5087*p = -55957 To find out the value of 'p', we need to divide that big number without 'p' (-55957) by the number next to 'p' (5087). I know these numbers seem really big, but we can do it: p = -55957 / 5087 When we divide, we get the answer for the value of 'p': p ≈ -11 So, little buddy, the value of 'p' that solves the equation is approximately -11.

Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\" Paragraph: Two continents had different histories.

Input: Passage: Robertson moved to Central States Wrestling, where he won the majority of his titles. On October 22, 1981, he won the NWA Central States Television Championship with a victory over Gene Lewis. He lost the belt to Oliver Humperdink later that year but soon regained it in a rematch. On February 18, 1982, however, he dropped the belt back to Lewis. This allowed Robertson to focus on the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship, which he won a total of five times. His first reign came in October 1981 when he teamed with Rufus R. Jones to defeat Buzz Tyler and James J. Dillon. His next reign came in March 1982 when he teamed with Steve Regal to win the belts from Roger Kirby and Jerry Valiant. The title changed hands twice more that month, as Kirby and Valiant quickly regained the title only to drop it back to Robertson and Regal. Two months later, Kirby and Valiant won the belts back again. Robertson found a new partner, however, and won the championship by teaming with Hercules Hernandez in August. The reign lasted less than a month, but Robertson and Hernandez held the belts one final time after another victory in September 1982. The following year, Robertson's main success came as a singles wrestler. On February 10, 1983, he won the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship with a victory over Manny Fernandez. He lost the belt to Bob Brown two months later but regained it in a rematch the following week. Robertson's final title reign ended when he dropped the title to Race on June 2, 1983.

Reduce the amount of time goats are milked. Identify and segregate or cull affected goats.","completion":"Title: Enhancing Pre-Milking Hygiene Practices to Reduce Infection Risks and Maximize Efficiency in Goat Farming Introduction Goat farming has gone through a revolutionary change over the years, providing livelihood for millions across the globe. As goats play a vital role in the sustenance and economic benefits to farmers, it becomes imperative to adopt effective strategies that ensure high-quality milk production, minimize risks to health, and promote efficiency in milking practices. This article will shed light on building better pre-milking hygiene practices, reducing the time taken to milk goats, and identifying and segregating or culling impacted goats. Enhancing Pre-Milking Hygiene Pre-milking hygiene practices are critical in ensuring the production of high-quality milk while reducing the spread of infections or contamination that could lead to illness for farmers and consumers. Simple but effective steps can be implemented to promote better hygiene practices. They include: 1. Consistently washing hands: Farmers need to wash their hands thoroughly before and after handling goats, thus minimizing the chances of transmitting infections. 2. Cleaning and sanitizing milking equipment: Regular and thorough cleaning of milking tools and supplies is vital in mitigating the spread of bacteria and other pathogens that could enter the milk supply. 3. Providing a clean and dry milking environment: Regularly cleaning and sanitizing the milking area helps prevent the build-up of bacteria, which could contaminate the milk or infect the goats. 4. Washing the goat's udders: It is essential to clean the udders of the goats before milking to reduce bacterial contamination in the milk. This also helps keep the goat healthy and prevents the spread of pathogens. 5. Training farm laborers: Workers involved in the milking process should be trained on proper pre-milking hygiene routines to comply with standards and ensure a healthy environment for both humans and goats. Reducing Milking Time By reducing the amount of time goats are milked, farmers can improve efficiency and minimize stress on the animals. Here are ways to accomplish this: 1. Implementing automated milking systems: Advanced milking machines can help save time and labor while promoting consistency in the milking process. These systems also ensure that the right amount of milk is extracted, thus preventing any loss due to over-milking. 2. Regular maintenance of milking equipment: To prevent delays caused by malfunctioning equipment, it is crucial to regularly maintain and repair milking tools. This ensures smooth and efficient functioning, leading to reduced milking time and enhanced productivity. 3. Scheduling and organization: By establishing a routine milking schedule and organizing the goats in a systematic manner, farmers can quickly and consistently attend to each animal, minimizing the time spent on milking. Identifying and Segregating Affected Goats Proper identification and segregation or culling of impacted goats is crucial to maintain a healthy herd and guarantee high-quality milk production. Here's how to achieve this: 1. Regular health checks: Keep a watchful eye on the goats for signs of illness, infections, or diseases that may affect their milk production. Regular health checks will also alert farmers to potential problems before they become widespread among the herd. 2. Segregation of affected goats: If any goats show signs of mastitis, a highly contagious disease among goats, or other contagious illnesses, they should be segregated from the herd to prevent the spread of infection. 3. Culling: In cases where the affected goat is not responding to treatment or poses a significant threat to the rest of the herd, farmers may opt to cull the animal. This difficult decision helps to maintain the overall health and productivity of the goat farm. Conclusion Improving pre-milking hygiene, reducing milking time, and effectively identifying and segregating or culling affected goats are essential measures to ensure a productive and healthy goat farm. Implementing these measures can lead to higher milk quality, increased profits, and a better life for both farmers and goats worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. James Lawrence Levine (; born June 23, 1943) is an American conductor and pianist. He is primarily known for his tenure as Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera (the \\"Met\\"), a position he held for 40 years (1976-2016). He was formally terminated by the Met from all his positions and affiliations with the company on March 12, 2018 over sexual misconduct allegations which he denies. Levine made his Metropolitan Opera (the \\"Met\\") debut at age 28 on June 5, 1971, leading a June Festival performance of Tosca. Following further appearances with the company, he was named principal conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in February 1972. He became the Met's principal conductor in 1973, and its Music Director in 1975. In 1983, he served as conductor and musical director for the Franco Zeffirelli screen adaptation of La Traviata, which featured the Met orchestra and chorus members. He became the company's first artistic director in 1986, and relinquished the title in 2004. In 2005, Levine's combined salary from the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Met made him the highest-paid conductor in the country, at 3.5 million. During Levine's tenure, the Metropolitan Opera orchestra expanded its activities into the realms of recording, and separate concert series for the orchestra and chamber ensembles from The Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. Levine led the Metropolitan Opera on many domestic and international tours. For the 25th anniversary of his Met debut, Levine conducted the world premiere of John Harbison's The Great Gatsby, commissioned especially to mark the occasion. On his appointment as general manager of the Met, Peter Gelb emphasized that Levine was welcome to remain as long as he wanted to direct music there. Levine was paid 2.1 million by the Met in 2010. Following a series of injuries that began with a fall (see below), Levine's subsequent health problems led to his withdrawal from many Metropolitan Opera conducting engagements. Following a May 2011 performance of Die Walkure, Levine formally withdrew from all conducting engagements at the Met. After two years of physical therapy, Levine returned to conducting with a May 2013 concert with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. On September 25, 2013, Levine conducted his first Met performance since May 2011, in a revival production of Cosi fan tutte. Levine was scheduled to conduct three productions at the opera house and three concerts at Carnegie Hall in the 2013-14 season. On April 14, 2016, Met management announced that Levine would step down from his position as Music Director at the end of the 2015-16 season. Levine was paid 1.8 million by the Met for the 2015/16 season. He assumed the new title of Music Director Emeritus, which he held until December 2017, when in the wake of allegations that Levine had sexually abused four young men, the Met suspended its relationship with him and cancelled all his future scheduled performances with the company.

It's increasingly clear that this is the case with school bullying :Only news reports about it have increased, not the behavior itself. In fact, both bullying and fear of it are down among US middle school students The rate of students who reported fearing an attack or harm at school at all has dropped dramatically, from nearly 12% in 1995 to less than 4% in 2011. For black and Hispanic students, it's an even more encouraging shift--from more than 20% of both groups of students worried about being attacked at school to less than 5% in 2011. The decline in actual physical violence in schools is even more dramatic: It was down 74% between 1992 and 2010, according to the latest US Department of Justice data. What about cyberbullying? Online _ increased from 6% in 2000 to 9% in 2005 to 11% in 2010 between, and it's interesting to note that it increased less between 2005 and '10 than in the first 5 years tracked. Because social media is very much a reflection of school social life for young people, the peer aggression seen in social media is a lot like the peer aggression seen on school bathroom walls. So once it finds its \\"dead level,\\" it will probably decline in the same way verbal and written aggression have. Besides education and crime prevention at the social level, medicine treatment and better access to mental healthcare also contribute to this downward trend in victimization of self and others. The rise of social media is what people don't typically think of as a positive force in society. But Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire says, \\"These technologies might have prevented crime and bullying by providing more ways of help, more forms of social supervision, and interesting activities that destroy forms of alienation that lead to crime\\".

Es erfordert jedoch eine größere politische Entschlossenheit, die Blockierungen beim Gemeinschaftspatent aufzuheben, das sich zu einem Symbol für die Fähigkeit oder die Unfähigkeit der Union entwickelt hat, ihre gesteckten Ziele verwirklichen zu können. Translate to English","completion":"However, it requires greater political determination to break the deadlock on the Community patent, which has become a symbol of the European Union's ability or inability to achieve its set goals. The European Union has been working towards establishing a unified and streamlined patent system through the introduction of a Community patent, also known as the European Union patent. This Community patent is intended to provide a single, cost-effective patent protection system covering all member states, eliminating the need for obtaining individual patents in each country, which can be a time-consuming and expensive process. Breaking the deadlock on the Community patent has been challenging due to various political, economic, and legal factors. These challenges stem from differing perspectives, interests, and concerns of the member states. One such challenge is the language regime for filing and processing patent applications. The European Union has 24 official languages, and translating patents into every language can be a costly and time-consuming process. The need for a balance between reducing costs and ensuring effective communication across all member states has been a point of contention. Another issue is the legal framework surrounding the enforcement of patents and the resolution of disputes. Like national laws, patent laws differ across European Union countries, which can lead to inconsistencies in the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. The establishment of a unified European patent court has been proposed as a solution; however, concerns about its jurisdiction, legal basis, and cost-effectiveness have yet to be fully addressed. Furthermore, economic disparities among European Union member states have also contributed to the deadlock. Economically powerful nations, such as Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, have been more inclined to support the Community patent, citing the potential for improved competitiveness and innovation. In contrast, smaller and less economically developed countries may fear potential disadvantages, such as higher costs or reduced national control over intellectual property rights. Overcoming these challenges requires greater political determination from all European Union member states. This requires a willingness to compromise, find mutually beneficial solutions, and demonstrate a commitment to making the Community patent a reality. For the European Union, the ability to break the deadlock on the Community patent will indeed be symbolic of its capacity to achieve its set goals and foster economic integration and innovation through collaboration. By effectively addressing the concerns of all stakeholders and moving forward together, the European Union can turn the Community patent from a symbol of its inability to a symbol of its success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: For years, Jevon “Goldie” Lawson dealt crack on the steps of a 7-Eleven in a rough part of this blue-collar town. He smoked the rocks he didn’t sell and often appeared as strung out as his customers. But in 2008, he moved into a 400,000 house, started driving a champagne-colored Humvee, and made himself the star act of his own hip-hop label. He abandoned the crack business. Found something better, he told associates. What he found was OxyContin from Southern California, where organized drug rings were colluding with rogue doctors and pharmacies to obtain enormous quantities of the drug. Illicit OxyContin devastated the entire Everett region. At the height of the drug’s popularity, it was a factor in more than half of the crimes in Snohomish County. Abuse of the drug touched off an epidemic of painkiller and heroin addiction, which continues to this day. The crisis swept up many young people, such as Katie McKnight, the daughter of an Everett physician whose dependency outlasted seven trips to rehab, and Brandon Smith, who lost a promising career at Nintendo and, ultimately, his freedom to OxyContin. An Inland Empire branch of the Crips trafficked pills out of L.A. and by plane. The destination was Everett, Wash. Authorities in Everett knew much ofthe drug was coming from traffickers in the Los Angeles area, but they were unable to determine how pills were getting on the black market. A Times review of court records and law enforcement reports suggests that several people who sent OxyContin from Southern California to Lawson in Everett were buying pills from Lake Medical, a clinic near MacArthur Park that was a front for a drug ring. The records, along with interviews of law enforcement officials, indicate that Inland Empire Crips gang members drove bags of OxyContin north on Interstate 5 to Washington State and sent couriers aboard planes to Seattle with pills strapped to their bodies. At the time OxyContin was ravaging Everett, Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, was tracking the voluminous prescriptions written by Lake Medical’s doctors as well as the extraordinary quantities of pills ordered by corrupt pharmacies filling those prescriptions. It did not track Lake Medical pills to their final destinations, however. It wasn’t until years later, after authorities brought down the ring, that Purdue shared the information with law enforcement. By then, 1.1 million pills had spilled onto the black market. Everett, a city of 100,000, hugs Port Gardner Bay about halfway between Seattle and the Canadian border. Ferries crisscross the blue-gray waters of Puget Sound; the snowcapped Cascades rise behind the modest skyline. A thriving mill town at the turn of the 20th century, Everett has seen its fortunes rise and fall with various industries — shipbuilding, lumber, iron and canneries. The largest employers today are Boeing, which assembles four types of airliners at a plant along Interstate 5, and the U.S. Navy, which has a deep-water port on the north end of town. The region had long grappled with methamphetamine abuse. But with the California pills flowing to Lawson, OxyContin became the community’s most pressing drug problem. Lawson wasn’t shy about the source of his new wealth. He wore a pendant necklace with a map of the West Coast in diamonds and a trail of gems the color of 80-milligram OxyContin connecting Los Angeles and Washington state. He sold the 80-milligram tablets — the maximum-strength pill favored by addicts — in bulk to local gangs that used small-time dealers to peddle them for up to 80 a piece. Dealers sold pills in parks, outside grocery stores and at car washes. The aluminum foil that addicts used to smoke the pills littered parking lots and sidewalks. Some grocery stores gave away foil squares to discourage the rampant shoplifting of Reynolds Wrap. Addicts burglarized homes, picked pockets, stole identities, robbed businesses and prostituted themselves. Young women in pasties and thongs offered sexual favors alongside lattes at a proliferation of drive-in “bikini” espresso stands. OxyContin seemed to attract people with no criminal records and stable homes, jobs, and families. “They were a segment of society you would never have anticipated,” said Coleen St. Clair, a former Snohomish County prosecuting attorney who worked in the narcotics unit. Katie McKnight was smart and beautiful, a gifted athlete and the daughter of an Everett internist. A friend had given her a pill in 2006 during her first year at a local community college and, in the words of her mother, Mary, “that was it.” To buy pills, the young woman stole her sister’s graduation money, her parents’ checkbook and, twice, her mother’s engagement ring. She tried to snatch a woman’s purse in a grocery store parking lot, shoplifted and, for a time, worked as a stripper. Her father was familiar with OxyContin, but in his many years at a busy city clinic, he had never come across a patient who required a maximum-strength dose. He struggled to comprehend how his daughter was getting her hands on large numbers of 80-milligram tablets. “It seemed so completely outside the realm of possibility,” Robert McKnight said. When Lawson began dealing OxyContin in Everett, the 24-year-old had finished a year in prison for theft and her parents were doing everything they could to help her stay sober. They let her move back into her childhood bedroom, drove her to 12-step meetings and supported her efforts to find a job. But Katie relapsed, often spending nights at a motel where, the authorities said, dealers connected to Lawson sold 80s in the parking lot. On one car ride to a treatment center, her mother recalled, Katie studied her reflection in the visor mirror. After several long moments, she said quietly to herself, “I am so broken.” To Brandon Smith, who worked in marketing for Nintendo, OxyContin seemed less a dangerous narcotic than a status symbol. The popular crowd openly smoked the “green beans” on pieces of foil. “It was socially acceptable,” said Smith, who lived near Everett. “It was almost the new weed.” Smith became addicted, then got clean for a time. But in January 2009, at the age of 24, he relapsed. The flood of OxyContin into Everett had driven down prices and more people than ever were selling. By the summer of 2009, Smith had a 150-a-day habit. He’d been forced out of his job for stealing. He’d spent his 401(k) and sold his belongings. On a July afternoon, he was out of cash and going into withdrawal. He saw only one way out. He walked into a tanning salon near Everett and pointed a gun at a clerk. “Give me all your money,” he told her. He committed another robbery later that day. And the next. And the next. The cashiers didn’t notice the gun was a fake. What they did remember was that the man holding it was polite and apologized as he left. Two weeks into the 2009 spree, a local TV news program broadcast surveillance video of the “Tanning Salon Bandit.” Smith’s mother, watching at home, immediately recognized her son and phoned police. Officers surrounded him as he left his apartment the next morning. As they trained their weapons on him, he would later recall, he felt a brief sense of confusion. “It’s just me, guys,” he remembered thinking. “It’s just Brandon.” Smith confessed to at least 17 robberies. He was sentenced to 14 years in state prison, where he remains today. “I never meant to hurt anyone,” he told detectives. “One thing led to another.” Working OxyContin cases for the Snohomish Regional Drug Task Force, Det. Nicole Richardson spent many of her days talking to addicts and their families. “It impacted probably every aspect of the local community,” Richardson recalled. “A couple of individuals with the right connections in California flooded the Snohomish County market and unfortunately made a huge problem.” Investigators in Everett arrested Jevon Lawson in 2010, about the same time an L.A. drug task force was closing in on members of the Lake Medical ring. Federal prosecutors in L.A. won convictions of the clinic leaders while their counterparts in Seattle successfully prosecuted Lawson and several Californians supplying him with OxyContin. In Everett, Jevon “Goldie” Lawson bought bags of pills from L.A. gangmembers. He sold them to local dealers in Mill Creek and other places around the region. A defendant in one of the Washington state cases, a San Bernardino woman who pleaded guilty to laundering nearly 1 million as part of a conspiracy to supply OxyContin to Lawson, had purchased large quantities of OxyContin pills from Lake Medical, according to a DEA analyst’s report and an informant’s statement to authorities. The prosecutors did not allege in court that the OxyContin in Everett came specifically from the Lake Medical ring, and internal Purdue emails reviewed by The Times did not indicate that Purdue knew of a connection. Ultimately, the authorities in Everett built their case against Lawson and his associates with old-fashioned police work — surveilling drug spots, working informants and carrying out buy-and-bust operations. He pleaded guilty to federal drug charges in 2011 and is serving an 8-year prison term. In August 2010, two years after the OxyContin crisis began in Everett, Purdue introduced a new tablet that was more difficult to turn into powder. Addicts could no longer smoke the pills, but many of them moved to heroin, which is chemically similar and cheaper. Dealers who had been selling heroin to the same small group of drug users for years suddenly found themselves with a booming new clientele of, as one former dealer from Everett recalled, “upper- and middle-class children.” Today, heroin addiction is a public health crisis in Snohomish County; more than 40 residents fatally overdose each year. Katie McKnight had used heroin and other drugs when she couldn’t afford OxyContin, but after the pill reformulation, she became a full-time intravenous heroin user. In the fall of 2011, she was living in a squalid apartment with a drug dealer boyfriend and praying for sobriety. “God please give me some kind of way to get into detox to get the help I need to kick the dependence and have my life back,” she wrote in pink cursive in her journal on Oct. 1, 2011. “I seriously feel like I’m slowly dying. I need help!” Nineteen days later, she overdosed in her apartment. Her parents stood outside in the cold, misty darkness for an hour while paramedics worked to revive her. Finally, a police officer came out and told them their daughter was gone. The McKnights keep her ashes in an urn on their nightstand. Robert McKnight often wakes thinking about his daughter. “You kind of look back and ask yourself, “What if the OxyContin was not there?’” he said.

Signifying the town as 'blue-collar' implies its working-class nature and perhaps its vulnerability to such illicit activities.

Ohio Billy may live in Ohio, a state in the Midwest region of the United States. As the owner of the finest clothing store in the Midwest, it is likely that Billy's store is located in a bustling and populous area where a wide range of customers can access his high-quality and fashionable items. Ohio offers a variety of cities and towns, such as Columbus, Cincinnati, or Cleveland, where his store could thrive due to the higher population and the potential for increased foot traffic. Option A, strip mall, is not applicable as it is a type of location where his store might be situated, rather than a place for Billy to live. Similarly, option E, shopping mall, is also a possible location for his store but not for his residence. Option B, heaven, is an unrealistic and metaphorical option for where Billy might live. Option D, city or town, is a vague answer. While it indicates that Billy may live in a city or town, it does not provide a specific region or place within the Midwest. Therefore, the most suitable option to answer the question of where Billy, the owner of the finest clothing store in the Midwest, might live is Ohio.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose departure inspired the song, \\"Rosy Won't You Please Come Back? ? The story is partially inspired by the Davies brothers' older sister Rose, who emigrated to Australia in 1964 with her husband Arthur Anning. Her departure devastated Ray Davies, and it inspired him to write the song \\"Rosy Won't You Please Come Home\\", included on the 1966 album Face to Face. The lead character in the album, the fictional Arthur Morgan—modelled after Anning—is a carpet layer whose family's plight in the opportunity-poor setting of post-war England is depicted. Writer Julian Mitchell detailed the story line and characters in depth, explaining in the liner notes for the album's LP release: Arthur Morgan ... lives in a London suburb in a house called Shangri-La, with a garden and a car and a wife called Rose and a son called Derek who's married to Liz, and they have these two very nice kids, Terry and Marilyn. Derek and Liz and Terry and Marilyn are emigrating to Australia. Arthur did have another son, called Eddie. He was named after Arthur's brother, who was killed in the battle of the Somme. Arthur's Eddie was killed, too—in Korea. Davies would later comment in his autobiography, X-Ray, that Anning later \\"told me that he ... knew it [Arthur] had been partly inspired by him ... [it] reminded him of home ... I told Arthur that I felt guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but he shrugged off my apology, saying that he was flattered.\\" With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England that Arthur once knew (\\"Victoria\\", \\"Young and Innocent Days\\"), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons (\\"Australia\\"), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home (\\"Shangri-La\\"), the resolve of the British people during the Second World War (\\"Mr. Churchill Says\\"), the privations that marked the austerity period after the war (\\"She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina\\"), and the death of his brother in World War I (\\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\", \\"Some Mother's Son\\").

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Around every Lunar New Year holiday, China becomes a country on the move. The holiday crush this year is estimated to be even heavier than before. Government officials suggest that Chinese people will take to the air, roads and railways 3.62 billion times over a 40-day period around the nation's most important holiday this year as people push their way home for family gatherings or to satisfy their new-found passion for travel. Getting tickets to all those would-be travelers is a _ challenge that tries your patience annually. And the pressure for the railway system is always the greatest. Railways are the transport of choice for low-cost long-distance travel, and that's where the ticketing system regularly falls down. Much of the criticism has focused on the railway's online purchasing system, which has been unable to keep pace with the huge demand and also failed to stop scalpers from easily getting many of the hard-to-find tickets. Railway officials believed that online sales were the fairest way to get tickets for travelers, and told reporters that the public need to be patient. While by now the railway service is far from satisfying, efforts are being made to provide online identity checks that would reduce the ticket scalping problems, and the situation is expected to get better in a few years. Meanwhile, for those traveling by car, good news is that the country's extremely expensive highway tolls will be removed for the period of the official holiday. Question: We can learn from the text that around the New Year holiday, _ . Options: A: there will be 3.62 billion people going home B: many people have to buy railway tickets from scalpers C: the railway system will break down as usual D: not railways but cars are the best choices for traveling A:","completion":"many people have to buy railway tickets from scalpers"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have: -6c - 10c - 2727 + 2279 = 0 First, let's combine the terms containing the variable c: -6c - 10c = -16c Now, let's put the constant terms together: -2727 + 2279 = -448 Now, we have a simplified equation: -16c - 448 = 0 Our next step is to isolate the variable (c). To do this, we need to move the constant term (which is currently subtracted) to the other side of the equation. Since the constant term is -448, we'll add 448 to both sides of the equation: -16c - 448 + 448 = 0 + 448 -16c = 448 Now, to find the value of c, we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of c, which is -16: c = 448 / -16 c = -28 So, the solution to the given equation -6c - 10c - 2727 + 2279 = 0 is c = -28."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the topic that this about: The UK Conservative Party has some challenging environmental policies, though there are several glaring gaps. Available choices: a). World; b). Sports; c). Business; d). Science/Tech;","completion":"d). Science/Tech The topic this passage relates to is Science/Tech, more specifically pertaining to environmental policies and sustainable development. The passage briefly discusses the environmental policies of the UK Conservative Party, highlighting that there are some significant gaps in their approach. Environment and sustainable development are considered part of the Science/Tech topic since they are deeply intertwined with advancements, innovations, and policy changes that involve scientific research, technological breakthroughs, and their implementation in various sectors. In recent years, environmental issues have gained increasing importance in the political agendas of various countries, and the UK is no exception. As a part of their strategy, the UK Conservative Party has pushed for the adoption of cleaner energy sources, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and increased focus on preserving natural resources. However, critics argue that these policies do not go far enough in addressing climate change and other pressing environmental challenges facing our planet today. Here are some of the key environmental policies under the UK Conservative Party: 1. The Climate Change Act: A significant cornerstone of the UK's environmental initiatives, the Climate Change Act (2008), mandates a legally binding reduction of at least 80% of greenhouse gas emissions compared to the levels in 1990 by the year 2050. The Conservative Party supports this ambitious goal and has expanded it with a new target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 2. Offshore Wind Energy Generation: The Conservative Party's environmental plan includes a focus on increasing the UK's offshore wind energy generation capacity. The party aims to have up to 40GW of installed offshore wind energy by 2030, which would provide clean energy for millions of households across the country. 3. Plastic Waste Reduction: To reduce plastic waste, the UK Conservative Party has introduced a ban on plastic straws, stirrers, and cotton buds since 2020. Moreover, the party pledged to work towards eradicating all single-use plastics in government departments and to encourage businesses to follow suit. Despite these policies, many critics argue that there are important gaps in the UK Conservative Party's environmental approach. Such gaps include: 1. Lack of Comprehensive Plans to Phase Out Fossil Fuels: While the Conservative's energy policies have focused on renewable sources, they lack concrete plans to phase out fossil fuels entirely, especially in sectors like transportation and heating. 2. Inadequate Focus on Nature Conservation: The UK’s environmental policies do not address issues like habitat loss, wildlife conservation, and biodiversity degradation as effectively as they should. The government's plans to promote economic growth and infrastructure development often overlook these aspects, which can pose long-term consequences for ecosystems and ultimately human well-being. 3. Limited Support for Sustainable Agriculture and Food Production Systems: The Conservative Party has been criticized for not taking strong enough stances on promoting sustainable agriculture and encouraging the reduction of food waste. Developing efficient policies to address unsustainable farming practices and pesticide overuse remains a challenge. To summarise, the passage is related to the Science/Tech topic, as it brings attention to the environmental policies implemented by the UK Conservative Party and highlights the need for significant improvements to address the pressing environmental challenges ahead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 1910 Chinese expedition to Tibet or the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1910 was a military campaign of the Qing dynasty to establish direct rule in Tibet in early 1910. The expedition occupied Lhasa on February 12 and officially deposed the 13th Dalai Lama on the 25th. Qing rule of Tibet was established in the early 18th century after the 1720 Chinese expedition to Tibet, but it was essentially a protectorate rather than a direct rule. The actual rule also waned considerably with the gradual weakening of the Qing dynasty in the 19th century. After the British expedition to Tibet in 1904 and the Sino-British treaty in 1906, the Qing decided to establish direct rule over Tibet and thus sent such an expedition in 1910. As Professor Dawa Norbu stated, \\"The British military expedition and subsequent convention made the Chinese realize that their power in Tibet had disappeared. So, in 1910 China invaded Tibet, and the Dalai Lama fled to India.\\" In the late winter of 1910, the Manchu government in Beijing was furious with the 13th Dalai Lama. His government, having witnessed the dissolution of its domains in Khams by Qing administrators, and fearing that the amban in Lhasa was going to eliminate its temporal authority, cut this imperial officer off from the sustenance that the Tibet government had guaranteed him in a prior agreement with the Qing court. When a relief column arrived in Lhasa from Sichuan to break the amban out of his isolation, the Dalai Lama fled for British India. However, the direct rule over Tibet proved short-lived: after the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution and the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil in 1911-1912, Qing rule essentially ended in Lhasa and other parts of Tibet. All Qing forces left Tibet by the end of 1912.

Step 2: Consider the options - We need to find which option is most relevant to the context of the question. Options: - ocean - southern Europe - Japan - rice paddy - Italy Step 3: Evaluate each option - I will now go through the options one by one and decide if they fit the question or not. Option 1: Ocean - This option is not related to the context of the question. John is trying to get an authentic pizza, and it's unlikely he would find that in the ocean. Therefore, we can eliminate this option. Option 2: Southern Europe - Southern Europe is known for having several countries that have a strong tradition of authentic pizza, such as Italy and Greece. This is a possible option regarding the context of the question, so I'll keep it. Option 3: Japan - Although Japan has adopted some Western food practices, it is not primarily known for authentic pizza. The question is asking specifically for an authentic pizza experience, so Japan is less likely to provide that, compared to other options. Thus, we can eliminate this option. Option 4: Rice paddy - A rice paddy is an agricultural area used for growing rice, and it has no relevance to the context of the question. John is looking for authentic pizza, not rice, so we can eliminate this option. Option 5: Italy - Italy is widely considered the birthplace of pizza, and it is renowned for having a rich tradition of authentic pizza. This option is highly relevant to the question, so I'll keep it. Step 4: Compare the remaining options - We are left with Southern Europe and Italy as possible options. Step 5: Make the final decision - Although both Southern Europe and Italy are possible locations to find authentic pizza, Italy is more specific and directly related to the pizza tradition.

Movie plot title: The Cabin in the Woods Movie plot: The movie opens with a pair of middle-aged men walking through some kind of facility discussing mundane details about marriage and potential children, while a younger woman in a lab coat is trying to inform them about an incident at the Stockholm facility. The two men are not particularly concerned about what she is telling them. They mention that the facility in Japan will get the job done, and that their U.S. facility usually comes in second place. As they board a golf cart and drive off, the younger of the two men invites the older one to come over to his house for the upcoming weekend.The scene shifts to a room in a college town where Dana (Kristen Connolly) and Jules (Anna Hutchison) are talking about school. Apparently, Dana had an affair with one of her professors and it ended badly. Jules's boyfriend Curt (Chris Hemsworth) walks in and throws a football at the girls. It flies out the window and Curt's friend Holden (Jesse Williams), a fix-up for Dana, catches it down below. The guys are there to pick up the girls for a long weekend at a lakeside cabin that Curt's cousin owns. Dana finishes packing and they all go downstairs to pack up the RV.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: For 3-7 days, track when, what, and how much you drink, and when and how much you urinate. After several days, you’ll likely start to notice clear patterns to your urination habits. Ideally, you should use a collection cup to record how much you urinate each time. Alternatively, you can just estimate the amount as “a lot,” “average,” and “a little.” After you’ve kept track of when you usually urinate, build a schedule around this data. To start out, try to set up the schedule so that you urinate every 2 to 2.5 hours during the daytime. For example, schedule a “pee break” when you wake up (6:30 am), then when you arrive at work (9:00 am), then right before your lunch break (11:30 am), and so on. Do your best to stick to your schedule. Waiting 5-15 minutes can help stretch your bladder so that, over time, it can hold more urine. If you really need to go, however, just go. If you start your schedule by urinating every 2 hours, move to 2.25 hours between restroom visits the next week, then 2.5 hours the week after that. Your end goal should be to urinate every 3-4 hours. While the average adult urinates every 3-4 hours, this may not be manageable for you. Stretch out your pee breaks slowly, and stop when you seem to have reached your limit. To practice, start urinating, then make yourself stop the stream of urine by contracting your muscles. These are the muscles of your pelvic floor. Once you know what it feels like to contract the pelvic floor muscles, you can do Kegel exercises at other times throughout your day. Try doing Kegel exercises during commercials while watching your favorite show, sitting at your desk, lying down, or filling up your car with gasoline—you can do them at almost any time, really. Try to do these exercises at least 3 times a day and at least 3-4 days a week. If you continue to need to urinate frequently despite your efforts to retrain your bladder, visit your doctor for a checkup. If you have to pee frequently and urgently, you may have an over-active bladder (OAB), which is a rather vaguely-defined medical condition that should be diagnosed by your doctor. OAB can often be treated by making healthy lifestyle changes—like improving your diet, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, and quitting smoking—and possibly by taking medication. Also speak to your doctor if you have any type of issues with incontinence—that is, releasing urine when you don’t intend to.","completion":"The article provides a guide on how to create a urination schedule, practice bladder control through Kegel exercises, and when to consult a doctor for potential over-active bladder (OAB) or incontinence issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Even after Bin Laden's departure from the area, CIA officers hoped he might return, seeing the camp as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up. The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance.

The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem.

These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over Bin Laden. The Taliban did not take him seriously, however.

Input: Question: What form of government did the place Palma was born in have at the time of her birth? Passage 1:Although originally proposed to the French space agency CNES, it was considered too complex and expensive for a single national programme. Its acceptance within the European Space Agency's scientific programme, in 1980, was the result of a lengthy process of study and lobbying. The underlying scientific motivation was to determine the physical properties of the stars through the measurement of their distances and space motions, and thus to place theoretical studies of stellar structure and evolution, and studies of galactic structure and kinematics, on a more secure empirical basis. Observationally, the objective was to provide the positions, parallaxes, and annual proper motions for some 100,000 stars with an unprecedented accuracy of 0.002 arcseconds, a target in practice eventually surpassed by a factor of two. The name of the space telescope, \\"Hipparcos\\" was an acronym for High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite, and it also reflected the name of the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who is considered the founder of trigonometry and the discoverer of the precession of the equinoxes (due to the Earth wobbling on its axis). Passage 2:In 2017, it was announced that Ring of Honor had signed Gresham to a contract. In April 2017, Gresham teamed with Chris Sabin where they defeated Cheeseburger and Will Ferrara. Gresham along with Jay White, Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley formed Search and Destroy. On June 24, Gresham defeated Flip Gordon.

In a wildly chaotic presidential election starring a tycoon-turned-reality-television-star from New York and a socialist from Vermont, is there room for another billionaire from Manhattan’s East Side? That is a central riddle facing former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg as he contemplates a third-party bid for the White House. Donald Trump’s resounding victories in South Carolina on Saturday and in Nevada’s caucuses Tuesday have solidified his status as the Republicans’ front-runner. On the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s unexpected surge — and landslide win in New Hampshire — have kept him in the race even as Hillary Clinton has regained some momentum following her narrow victory in Nevada last weekend. What remains unknown is whether Bloomberg, 74, is willing to insert himself into a contest that remains unpredictable even as the field of candidates winnows. [In Nevada caucuses, Trump scores a third straight victory] Speaking on CBS's \\"Face the Nation”, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Sunday, Jan. 24, that he would welcome a third party run from Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City. (Reuters) Bloomberg went out of his way last week to bemoan a campaign he described as a “race to the extremes,” with candidates exploiting Americans’ loss of faith in a political system that is “corrupt, gridlocked and broken.” “That’s why you see the current candidates out there doing well, and not the conventional ones,” Bloomberg told a gathering at a Manhattan book party, an apparent reference to Trump and Sanders. Looming over the deliberations is the question of which party a Bloomberg candidacy would hurt more. With polls suggesting that Bloomberg would draw more Democratic than Republican voters, it makes little sense that Trump’s surge would prompt the former mayor to run. That said, Bloomberg’s viability may be strengthened if Clinton is damaged by a drawn-out nomination process. Bloomberg proved his capacity for defying naysayers 15 years ago, when he captured New York’s City Hall. But New York is not the United States, and it’s far from certain that swing-state voters would embrace a former Republican known for opposing guns, smoking and Big Gulp sodas. Nor is it clear that a measured, sober-toned business executive could command an electorate that so far has rewarded unceasing bombast over pragmatism. “You don’t solve problems by pointing fingers or making pie-in-the-sky promises,” Bloomberg told the gathering last week. “You solve them by bringing people together around common goals, promoting innovation, demonstrating independence and recognizing that compromise is not a bad word.” Bloomberg’s potential as a candidate is rooted in what the Gallup organization has identified as an ever-broadening swath of American voters who define themselves as independent and express dissatisfaction with both major political parties. For those voters, familiar names such as Clinton and Jeb Bush may seem like more of the same; meanwhile, Sanders, Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) may be too extreme, creating opportunity for Bloomberg, a former Democrat who turned Republican before declaring himself unaffiliated in 2007. “There is a broad constituency, and there will be a broader one still, given the polarization of this election,” said Douglas Schoen, Bloomberg’s pollster, who recently wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed article headlined, “Why Mike Bloomberg Can Win.” “He’d be the only one talking about bipartisan consensus and bipartisan decision-making and results-oriented policies,” Schoen said. “In a particularly unstable political situation like the one we’re in now, where there’s so much anger, it’s impossible to write off any credible candidate.” Bloomberg would face daunting challenges, not the least of which would be prevailing in enough states to reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. American voters have never elected a third-party candidate to the presidency. In 1992, when he faced President George H.W. Bush and then-Gov. Bill Clinton, Ross Perot managed to draw 19 percent of the popular vote. But he did not win a single state. On a logistical level, Bloomberg’s campaign would need to quickly assemble an army to gather more than 900,000 signatures needed to qualify for the ballots in all 50 states, with a parade of rolling deadlines beginning this spring. “Every state has a different process for getting on the ballot, and it’s implicitly designed to make it very difficult,” said Reed Galen, a Republican strategist who advised Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. “Is it plausible for him to get on the ballot? Yes. Easy? No.” Perhaps more crucially, Bloomberg would need to sell himself to a public that is largely unaware of him. A Quinnipiac poll earlier this month found that 56 percent of American voters had not heard of Bloomberg, the owner of the media company that bears his name. And a new poll this week from the Associated Press showed even more dire numbers — that a majority of voters of both parties would not even consider voting for him. Ed Rollins, the Republican strategist who advised Perot in 1992, recalled that the Texas billionaire’s appearances on Larry King’s CNN talk show galvanized a massive effort to get him on ballots across the country. Unlike the enthusiastic hordes propelling Trump and Sanders, the strategist said, Bloomberg “has none of that. He has a billion dollars, but there’s not a movement for him.” “My sense is that people telling Bloomberg to run are his New York dinner companions who are not happy with their choices,” Rollins said. “That’s not a constituency or a movement. “Arguably, he was a good manager of New York,” Rollins said. “But the vast majority of Americans don’t care about New York.” New York’s political establishment ridiculed Bloomberg when he ran for mayor in 2001. No matter his wealth, the argument went, a political novice running as a Republican could never win in a city awash in Democratic voters. “He was seen as another one of these rich guys who had nothing better to do,” said Bill Cunningham, a former Bloomberg adviser who recalled that his own friends said he was “crazy” for signing on with the mogul’s campaign. While the Democratic nominee, Mark Green, was weakened by a savage primary battle that year, he still held a formidable lead over Bloomberg as the general-election campaign began. Bloomberg’s willingness to spend 50 million of his own fortune on the campaign allowed him to inundate New Yorkers with television ads and mailings. His proven financial acumen became ever more attractive after the 9/11 terrorist attacks decimated New York’s economy. And an 11th-hour endorsement from then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani — exalted at that point for his handling of the 9/11 aftermath — was tantamount to a blessing. But Bloomberg also closed the gap by identifying and, over the course of many months, methodically appealing to 800,000 New Yorkers who were unaffiliated with either the Democratic or the Republican parties. It was an effort that his advisers tout as key to his narrow victory. For all that, said Kenneth Sherrill, a Hunter College political science professor: “Everyone was flabbergasted when he went over the top. No one expected it.” Still, Bloomberg’s success in New York may have little bearing on how he would fare in a presidential race, the outcome of which is determined not by the popular vote but by the electoral college. “What works in New York doesn’t necessarily work in the rest of the country,” said Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of a nonpartisan newsletter covering state and federal campaigns. “He’s the guy who’s known for being against guns and soft drinks. Is that going to play in Fairbanks, Alaska, or the suburbs of Indianapolis?” Competing in a three-way race, Bloomberg’s progressive stances may not be problematic if he needs to win only a plurality against opponents such as Trump and Sanders. But his success would depend on independents remaining estranged from the two major parties by November — and on their willingness to expend their vote on a candidate whose viability is uncertain. Despite claims of political independence, voters’ “partisanship runs pretty deep,” Rothenberg said. “There are people who say they’re independent who aren’t really independent. They don’t want to throw their vote away.” Then there’s the question of which party a Bloomberg candidacy would damage more. A recent USA Today-Suffolk University poll showed Sanders in a close two-way contest against Trump but losing to the reality-television star if Bloomberg were on the ballot (Bloomberg placed third). Ultimately, Bloomberg’s challenge would be to identify those states in which he could win a plurality and put together the necessary electoral votes, an analysis Rothenberg undertook this month in a column in Roll Call. What Rothenberg concluded is that Bloomberg would have little chance in what Gallup and he have identified as the country’s 20 most conservative states, including Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Oklahoma and South Carolina. Bloomberg would also face imposing challenges in the country’s most left-leaning states, such as Oregon, Vermont, Massachusetts, Michigan and Maryland. There’s little question, though, that Bloomberg’s candidacy would upend the current list of key swing states in the general election — states including Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida, Colorado and Virginia. Where Bloomberg could find success, Rothenberg said, is in states such as California, New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — all states that typically vote Democratic. Ohio is the only swing state on that list. And with so many states probably out of reach, Bloomberg “would have to run the table” in those and other states. “That won’t be easy. My bottom line is I don’t see it.” Trump’s and Sanders’s success may have made the art of political predictions risky, Rothenberg said, but the math isn’t adding up, “even for Michael Bloomberg with all his money.” “When you look at the puzzle,” he said, “it’s, at the least, very, very difficult.” Scott Clement contributed to this report.","completion":"As Donald Trump gains momentum with more victories, there is still the question of whether former New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, will contemplate a third-party bid for the White House. Many people are questioning the role of another billionaire in the presidential election, but with an unpredictable contest unfolding, even within a winnowing field of candidates, Bloomberg has not yet revealed his intentions. Although New York is not the United States, and it remains uncertain how receptive swing-state voters would be to Bloomberg's positions on certain issues, there is little doubt that Bloomberg's candidacy would alter the current list of key swing states in the general election."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: New polling out over the past 24 hours suggests that Bernie Sanders is in a dead heat with Hillary Clinton in Iowa. Those results come as Clinton is upping her attacks on Sanders over his past votes on gun control measures, and Sanders appears to be getting more aggressive about Bill Clinton and his role in his wife's campaign. Oh, by the way, the Iowa caucuses are also only 21 DAYS AWAY! With so much going on in the Democratic primary, I reached out to Tad Devine, chief strategist for Sanders's campaign, to get his take on the state of the race — and how his candidate can win. Our conversation, conducted via email and edited only for grammar and flow, is below. FIX: NBC/Marist released a poll Sunday that showed Bernie within the margin of error in Iowa. Does that jibe with what you guys are seeing? And if so, what explains the momentum there? Devine: We believe the race has tightened in recent weeks in Iowa. I think a number of factors have led to the tightening. First, Bernie's message is very powerful: America has a rigged economy that is sending most of the new wealth to the top, and it's being held in place by a corrupt system of campaign finance. The Clinton campaign went on TV in Iowa (and New Hampshire) on Aug. 4. We started our media campaign Nov. 4. I think we have made up a lot of ground in both places since then. Also, Bernie is a very strong messenger for that message. He is credible and authentic, and people understand that these fights against powerful interests are the work of his life. FIX: Hillary is going hard at Bernie on guns. How do you guys respond? How vulnerable is your candidate on his past voting record on guns? And what does it tell you about the state of the race that she is attacking Sanders as aggressively as she is? Devine: When I saw Secretary Clinton call into \\"Hardball\\" on Friday night, I knew they must be very concerned about what was happening in the early states and elsewhere. Bernie Sanders earned his D- lifetime rating from the NRA, as well as his most recent rating of \\"F.\\" He has supported a ban on assault weapons since the late '80s, when he lost his first race for the House of Representatives based on his pledge to ban those weapons. He has supported background checks as well, and supports a law preventing straw purchases of guns. Bernie supports President Obama's executive actions on guns, and the president's efforts to take on the gun lobby. The truth is, while there are past differences on some gun legislation, going forward there are not big differences on this issue. That is why I don't think the gun issue will change the outcome of the race. FIX: Bernie has long pledged not to attack Clinton (or the Clintons) on personal matters. But at a town hall in Iowa late last week, he said that what Bill Clinton did was \\"totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable.” Isn’t that a violation of his no-attack principle? If not, why not? Devine: I think if people saw the question he was asked at that town hall meeting and the context, they would not view that part of one sentence you cited as a \\"negative attack.\\" He was asked a question and gave an answer which, in part, is not dissimilar to what almost all Democrats were saying at the time of President Clinton's impeachment trial — that what the president did was wrong. Bernie also stated that he was running against Hillary Clinton, not Bill Clinton, and has made clear repeatedly that he is not interested in making President Clinton's past an issue in the campaign. Bernie wants to talk about the issues that affect the lives of people today in America. FIX: Let’s say Hillary wins Iowa. Bernie wins New Hampshire. What do you say to critics who insist that Sanders has no wins beyond Feb. 9 on the calendar? Where can he win next? And how, given how much he has struggled to win over black and Hispanic voters from Clinton? Devine: Fix readers may remember Walter Mondale's campaign against Gary Hart when Senator Hart won the New Hampshire primary. I do because I was counting delegates for Mondale. The momentum that comes from an early victory is huge, and I believe that Bernie's campaign is in position to take advantage of that momentum. We have strong campaigns on the ground in Nevada and South Carolina, and we have been on radio in Nevada since November and on TV in Nevada since late December. (The Clinton campaign joined us on TV in Nevada on Friday). We have also been on radio in South Carolina since November. So I think we can compete and win in a number of states, like Massachusetts, Colorado, Minnesota and Vermont on March 1st and elsewhere as we move into big battlegrounds like Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. As to support from Latinos and African Americans, I think that support is growing by the day. For example, in the most recent Field poll in California, Bernie's support with Latinos grew from 3.2 percent in May to 35.3 percent in the poll they released last week. And that all occurred in a state where we have had no paid media. I think it bodes well for our potential to win substantial support from Latinos, African Americans and others as they come to know more about Bernie and his plans for their future. FIX: Finish this sentence: Bernie Sanders is a better general election candidate than Hillary Clinton for Democrats because ____________. Now explain. Devine: He can build a broad-based coalition that will elect Democrats up and down the ballot. Bernie, alone among Democrats, can build the kind of coalition that Barack Obama built in 2008. It begins with young people who are supporting him as they did Obama. And it continues with independents. Gallup today released its latest survey with the headline \\"Democratic, Republican identification near historical lows.\\" Independents, for the fifth consecutive year in the Gallup survey, comprise over 40 percent of the American electorate. We are already seeing general election polling that recognizes Bernie as by far the strongest candidate for the Democrats [because of] his core strength with independents. The truth is if we do not have a nominee who can win support from independents and even some Republicans, we will lose. Bernie won 25 percent of the Republican vote in his last reelection to the Senate (with 71 percent of the total vote). Also, so many people who now feel left out and left behind will, we believe, be motivated to participate in the process because Bernie alone speaks with conviction and authority to the concerns that are at the center of their lives.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who recorded Bryter Layter? Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales. By 2014, more than 2.4 million Nick Drake albums had been sold in the UK and the US. A:","completion":"The last name of the person who recorded Bryter Layter is Drake.

We have this equation: -41*p - 143 + 184 = 0 First, let's add 143 to both sides of the equation: (-41*p - 143) + 143 = 0 + 143 -41*p = 41 Now, remember that division is the opposite of multiplication. So, to find the value of \\"p\\", we need to divide both sides by -41: p = -41 / 41 Now, a negative number divided by a positive number will be a negative number: p = -1 So the answer is p = -1.

River Tam (Summer Glau) is coercively conditioned by Alliance scientists into a psychic assassin. She is rescued by her brother Simon (Sean Maher). During her training, River inadvertently read the minds of several officers and learned top government secrets. Consequently, a top Alliance agent known only as the Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is tasked with recapturing her. The siblings have found refuge aboard the transport spaceship Serenity with Captain Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), first mate Zoe Washburne (Gina Torres), pilot Hoban \\"Wash\\" Washburne (Alan Tudyk), mercenary Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin), and mechanic Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite). Despite Simon's objections, Mal brings River on a bank robbery where they are attacked by savage and cannibalistic Reavers. They escape, but Simon decides he and River will leave Serenity at the next port. Once there, however, a television commercial causes River to attack numerous bar patrons, and Mal takes the siblings back aboard the ship. The crew contacts reclusive hacker Mr. Universe (David Krumholtz), who discovers a subliminal message designed to trigger River's mental conditioning. He notes River whispered \\"Miranda\\" before attacking and warns that someone else saw the footage. Mal is invited to visit Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin), a former Serenity occupant. Despite knowing she is held hostage as a trap, Mal goes to rescue her. The Operative confronts Mal, promising to let him go free if he turns over River. Mal refuses and escapes with Inara.

Waco, Texas, where temperatures hit at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit 78 days this year, received 5.83 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas got 1.37 inches of rain, while San Antonio received 3.06 inches -- a record for the date. The weather service forecast rainfall amounts over the central and southern Plains of 1-3 inches per hour, with totals of more than 10 inches possible in some places by Monday morning. \\"This should put a significant dent in the ongoing severe drought over portions of the area, but this amount of rain in a short period of time could also lead to possible flash flooding across northern Texas and Oklahoma,\\" the weather service said. It added that drought conditions are expected to persist because of the magnitude of the shortage. With much of the state in an exceptional drought, Texas has been scarred by one of the worst fire seasons in memory. Since wildfire season started in November, more than 3.8 million of the state's 167.5 million acres have burned in some 24,000 fires, according to the Texas Forest Service. Roughly 2,800 homes were destroyed. \\"What the state needs is several widespread rainfall events over several months,\\" the weather service said.

Inside the theater the movie echoed him: \\"Because all of you of Earth are idiots!\\" Tom sighed, not for the first time that evening. The Manager, who paid in cash every Sunday, had decided to take advantage of the bizarre tastes of his Generation X clients and offer an Ed Wood film festival. Bride of the Monster, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Night of the Ghouls ran on the second, smaller screen on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two bucks a head. The Manager was making a killing. Tom, who needed the job in order to move out of his parents' trailer home, found little about the Ed Wood canon amusing, although it was light-years beyond anything by Coleman Francis. Even so, Tom had been forced to hear the dialog of each film, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday... He only had to watch them once, having filled in for the Manager's weasel-featured nephew/projectionist Neoldner, who had called in sick to buy grass in Beloit. But he would have been able to forget the experience had it not been for the penetrating soundtrack which bled into the lobby. The ordeal, for tonight, was almost over - the concession stand closed after Plan 9. He hoped he had sold enough to keep his job - there was the worry that the Manager would increase his profit margin by manning the concession stand himself. But the Manager strolled out of the second theater with a broad grin, revealing his cutting overbite. \\"I don't know why,\\" the Manager exclaimed, \\"but they love it!\\" \\"Most of them are from the 'Ed 9 Film Society,'\\" Tom replied. \\"By the way, I need to restock the chocolates.\\" Question: Tom sighs by the glass counter: Options: A.

How to supervise hamsters outside of the cage Check for escape routes and problem areas first. Hamsters are really fast and are often hard to catch, so be sure you have a good grip on it before you lift it out of its cage. Move the hamster quickly to the area where you want it to spend time out of its cage. Pick from: - When handling hamsters, don't be shocked (and don't drop them) if they nibble or bite you. Let your hamster out of its cage carefully.; - If there are any abandoned areas, close off them. Identify all the old stalls and ground floor cages in your yard.; - Don't handle it too roughly, or you could injure it.

Movie plot title: Death Ship Movie plot: A mysterious black freighter sails through the night, apparently deserted. Detecting a cruise ship close by, the ship alters course as disembodied voices announce in German, \\"Battle Stations! Enemy in sight!\\" Aboard the cruise ship, the prickly Captain Ashland is making his final voyage, attended by his replacement, Captain Trevor Marshall, who has brought along his family. The freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn. Despite Ashland's best efforts, the charging freighter collides with the cruise ship, sinking it. (Some of the sinking scenes were taken from the 1960 film The Last Voyage and darkened to match the nightly effect.) The next morning, a handful of survivorsâMarshall, his wife Margaret (Howes), and their children Robin and Ben; a young officer named Nick and his love interest Lori; the ship's comic Jackie; and a passenger, Mrs. Morganâare adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby and he's brought aboard, barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it's the ship that attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is swung outboard by one of the ship's cranes, which lowers him into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost. Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia. Hatches open and close by themselves and lights go on and off while a swinging block knocks out Nick, who is exploring above deck. Meanwhile, a delirious Ashland hears a mysterious voice speaking to him in German, telling him \\"This ship has been waiting for you...It is your new ship....Your chance has come!\\" The others finally set up in a dusty bunk room, and they separate to retrieve supplies and the injured captain....

Question: What do the villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking? Movie title: The First Grader Movie plot: In 2003, a disc jockey announces over a Kenyan radio station that the government is offering free primary school education to all natives who can prove citizenship with a birth certificate. Kimani Maruge (Litondo), an 84-year-old villager, hears this and decides to take it upon himself to seek an education. Arriving at his local school, he meets Jane Obinchu (Harris), the principal and teacher. He expresses his desire to learn how to read. Her teaching colleague Alfred (Munyua), ridicules him and demands he leave. Later, Jane informs her husband Charles (Kgoroge) about Maruge. He discourages her in supporting his educational endeavor. After beginning his initial classes, Maruge is plagued by memories of his service during the Mau Mau Uprising against the British in the 1950s. He begins to hallucinate and becomes confrontational with the students, struggling to continue his academics. Controversy begins to stir over Marugeâs education. Soon enough, the story that an elderly man going to school becomes national headlines. Mr. Kipruto (Kunene), a superintendent of the school district, is alerted to the situation and strongly disapproves of Maruge's predicament and suggests that he go to an adult educational facility. Meeting with the head of the education board to plead Marugeâs case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution.

As you mentioned, apart from a little rain, the day turned out quite well, which could have positively impacted the animals' behavior and willingness to be present in their enclosures or outdoor spaces designated for them. Option A (None of the above) can be disregarded as it suggests that none of the listed reasons were responsible for the visibility of the animals. Option C (The animals were forced to be outdoors for the tourists) might not be the best explanation, as zoos typically prioritize animal welfare and do not force animals to be outdoors if it is not in their best interest. Modern zoos take into account the natural habitats and preferences of animals and do their best to mimic these conditions. Furthermore, forcing animals to be guests' entertainment tends to stress them, leading to negative consequences for their overall health and well-being. Option D (The animals were in their mating season) might be a factor in some cases as certain animals exhibit increased activity and visibility during mating season. However, this is likely to only apply to a specific subset of animals, rather than to the majority present at the Zoo. Moreover, mating seasons differ among animal species, making it unlikely to be the primary reason for the animals' visibility during your visit. In conclusion, the favorable weather conditions on the day of your visit to the Zoo (Option B) were most likely the primary reason for the high visibility of the animals. The comfortable weather might have encouraged the animals to venture out of their shelters and engage more in their enclosures, giving visitors an opportunity to see and appreciate them up close."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: (CNN) In response to recent guidance by the American Medical Association against the use of powerful LED lights, cities such as Phoenix; Lake Worth, Florida; and 25 towns in Connecticut are now opting for street lamps with lower color temperatures, meaning less blue light emission. The association's policy statement, released in June, suggested that LED lights with color temperatures higher than 3000 Kelvin had adverse effects on health, including eye damage and disrupted sleep patterns. The warning was aimed at large cities, where the standard color temperature for LED street lights is 5000K to 6000K. Lights with high color temperatures release more blue light, which cause more glare and discomfort to the eyes, according to the association.The American Medical Association recommends LED lights with less blue lightSome cities are replacing street lamps to improve public health Question:Longcore suggests using high-_ in areas known for criminal activity and less intense lights elsewhere.

We do this by subtracting 135 from both sides: 15*d + 135 - 135 = 0 - 135 15*d = -135 Step 3: Solve for d: Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 15 to get the value of d: (15*d) / 15 = -135 / 15 d = -9 Thus, the solution to the equation 7*d + 8*d + 733 - 598 = 0 is d = -9."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The primary difference between ASP.NET and .NET lies in their application and usage within the realm of programming. 1. Application and Purpose: ASP.NET is a web development framework used for creating web applications, and it is a part of the .NET platform. It provides a programming model and infrastructure to develop robust and scalable applications. On the other hand, .NET (also known as .NET Framework) is a software development platform developed by Microsoft. It provides a controlled programming environment where software can be developed, installed and executed on Windows-based operating systems. 2. Extensibility: ASP.NET is built around the .NET Framework, hence, it includes all features that the .NET Framework offers. It is not a standalone entity but a component within the overarching .NET framework. Conversely, .NET is a larger, more comprehensive framework that can facilitate the development of different types of applications – not just web-based applications. It supports the development of desktop applications, mobile applications, and IoT devices as well. 3. Programming Languages: With ASP.NET, you can use languages like C#, VB.NET, and J# among others, specifically for web application development. The .NET Framework is language-independent, meaning you can develop applications in several .NET languages such as C#, VB.NET, F#, and more. It provides a broad range of functionalities and supports various programming models.

It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore.

As Sam and Alex approached the school track, they were excited to try out the new whistle they've bought. They knew Coach Thompson had a knack for collecting sports gear, but little did they know that he already owned a whistle. It had been a tough decision between the whistle and the stop watch at the store, but ultimately, they thought the whistle would be a more useful investment for the team's day-to-day practice sessions. Coach Thompson appreciated the thoughtfulness of his students, but with a gentle grin, revealed his own whistle dangling from a lanyard around his neck. His well-worn whistle had been with him throughout his entire coaching career, and he was not ready to part with it just yet. Sam and Alex exchanged embarrassed glances but decided they could still put their newly bought whistle to good use. Instead of letting their purchase go to waste, Sam and Alex approached some of the younger athletes on the track team who were running their laps. They taught the newcomers various whistle signals that corresponded to different running drills, strategies, and tactics. The whistle's crisp and clear sound was easy to hear above the sounds of the athletes' pounding feet and the winds that swept across the track. As the weeks went by, the team nicknamed Sam and Alex \\"The Whistle Duo.\\" Their commitment to helping the younger athletes quickly made them into unofficial assistant coaches, and the progress of the team members was evident. The track team's performance improved significantly, owing largely to the efforts of the Whistle Duo and the communication system they've established via whistle signals. The day finally arrived for the state championships. Coach Thompson entered his team into several relay races, confident that the well-trained athletes would excel. The young runners, who had once been inexperienced and struggling, now began to shine under the persistent guidance of their dedicated mentors. As the relay races were about to start, Coach Thompson assembled the team for a few final words. It was then that he added a surprising new report to the state championships--Sam and Alex were to become official assistant coaches for the varsity track and field team. The friends were thrilled; their roles would now contribute even more to the team’s success. As the races began, Coach Thompson stood on the sidelines, occasionally blowing his trusty whistle. At the same time, Sam and Alex offered precise instructions and encouragement to the athletes, using their own whistle to signal specific strategies and adjustments to the runners. The state championships were full of intense competition, but the team's synchronicity, strengthened by the whistle communication system, pushed them one step ahead of the rest. In the end, the team secured a historic victory.

I would say no, because the first question focuses on the selection process and the second question is about understanding the meaning of the questions. So the answer is: [I] no [II] no"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Answer the following question: What was the name of the album that had it's press tour interrupted after Bono was seriously inured in a bicycle accident in Central Park on 16 November 2014? Answer the above question based on the context below: Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign. Songs of Innocence recalls the group members' youth in Ireland, touching on childhood experiences, loves and losses, while paying tribute to their musical...

Translate to English","completion":"Everyone agrees that fundamentalism can take on various forms. Fundamentalism, as a concept, spans across different spheres like religion, politics, and culture. It is essential to understand the various ways that fundamentalism manifests itself, as well as its underlying motives, to grasp its impact on individuals and society as a whole. In the religious context, fundamentalism often refers to an unwavering adherence to a set of beliefs or principles that are considered central to a particular faith. People who embrace religious fundamentalism may view their interpretation of their faith as the only valid one, and they may reject any attempt to modernize or adapt their beliefs. This can sometimes cause tension within religious communities, as well as between adherents of different faiths. One of the most evident cases of religious fundamentalism in recent history is that of Islamic fundamentalist groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Both groups have attempted to establish control over territories in the Middle East and elsewhere, implement strict Islamic law, and execute acts of terror in the pursuit of their goals. Similarly, Christian fundamentalism, though not as violent, can be observed in the United States and other countries, where conservative Christians seek to enforce their views on issues such as abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Political fundamentalism, on the other hand, is characterized by an unwavering commitment to a specific ideology, often accompanied by a rejection of alternative viewpoints and an unwillingness to compromise. In the extreme, this can lead to authoritarian regimes that suppress dissent and enforce their ideology on the population at large. Examples of political fundamentalism can be found in global history, including the Communist regimes of the Soviet Union and China, and the fascist governments in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy during World War II. Cultural fundamentalism, or ethnocentrism, refers to the belief that one's own culture is superior to others and should be preserved from outside influences. Advocates of cultural fundamentalism may resist the integration of immigrants and advocate for policies that place their own culture above others. In some cases, cultural fundamentalism can lead to nationalist movements that seek to establish a nation state with a single dominant culture. Throughout history, different cultural fundamentalist groups have emerged, such as white supremacists in the United States advocating for preservation of so-called white culture, or the Hutu-Tutsi ethnic conflict in Rwanda. In conclusion, fundamentalism is a multifaceted phenomenon that can emerge in various domains of human life, such as religion, politics, and culture. It often involves a rigid adherence to a set of beliefs or values and a refusal to entertain competing perspectives. This can arise in response to perceived threats to one's identity, society, or way of life. Undeniably, fundamentalism has the potential to cause division, conflict, and even violence due to its propensity to resist change and suppress dissenting opinions. Therefore, it is crucial to promote understanding, tolerance, and dialogue to mitigate the impact of fundamentalism on individuals and societies alike."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Barkley was born and raised in Leeds, Alabama, ten miles (16 km) outside Birmingham, and attended Leeds High School. As a junior, Barkley stood 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and weighed 220 pounds (100 kg). He failed to make the varsity team and was named as a reserve. However, during the summer Barkley grew to 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) and earned a starting position on the varsity as a senior. Barkley played collegiate basketball at Auburn for three seasons. Although he struggled to control his weight, he excelled as a player and led the SEC in rebounding each year. He became a popular crowd-pleaser, exciting the fans with dunks and blocked shots that belied his lack of height and overweight frame. It was not uncommon to see the hefty Barkley grab a defensive rebound and, instead of passing, dribble the entire length of the court and finish at the opposite end with a two-handed dunk. His physical size and skills ultimately earned him the nickname \\"The Round Mound of Rebound\\". During his college career, Barkley played the center position, despite being shorter than the average center. His height, officially listed as 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), is stated as 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) in his book, I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It. He became a member of Auburn's All-Century team and still holds the Auburn record for career field goal percentage with 62.6%. He received numerous awards, including Southeastern Conference (SEC) Player of the Year (1984), three All-SEC selections and one Second Team All-American selection. Later, Barkley was named the SEC Player of the Decade for the 1980s by the Birmingham Post-Herald. In Barkley's three-year college career, he averaged 14.8 points on 68.2% field goal shooting, 9.6 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.7 blocks per game. In 1984, he made his only appearance in the NCAA Tournament and finished with 23 points on 80% field goal shooting, 17 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocks. Auburn retired Barkley's No. 34 jersey on March 3, 2001. In 2010, Barkley admitted that he asked for, and had been given, money from sports agents during his career at Auburn. Barkley called the sums he had requested from agents as being \\"chump change\\", and went on to say, \\"Why can't an agent lend me some money and I'll pay him back when I graduate?\\" According to Barkley, he paid back all of the money he had borrowed after signing his first NBA contract.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"how can you generate heat?\\" is \\"electrical energy\\", given that mammals can generate heat with their muscles? A:","completion":"While \\"electrical energy\\" is one method of generating heat, it may not be considered as the most comprehensive or \\"right\\" answer to the question \\"how can you generate heat?\\" as there are various ways to produce heat, including through biological means, chemical reactions, and physical processes. Here are some common methods to generate heat: 1. Electrical energy: Passing an electric current through a resistive object (like heating coils or electric stoves) can produce heat. This is known as Joule heating or resistive heating. 2. Mammals using their muscles: Warm-blooded animals can generate heat through metabolic processes that include muscle contractions (shivering) and brown fat (non-shivering thermogenesis). 3. Chemical reactions: Reactions such as combustion (burning of fuels like gasoline, coal, or wood) or exothermic reactions (where heat is produced as a byproduct) generate heat. 4. Friction: When two objects rub against each other, the kinetic energy is converted into heat. This is the principle behind starting a fire using sticks or generating heat by rubbing hands together. 5. Nuclear reactions: Fission (where large atomic nuclei split) and fusion (where small atomic nuclei combine) release enormous amounts of heat in nuclear power plants or stars like the Sun. 6. Solar radiation: The sun radiates energy in the form of electromagnetic waves, which, when absorbed by objects on Earth, can cause them to heat up. 7. Geothermal heat: The Earth's core continuously generates heat due to radioisotope decay, which can be used for heating purposes through geothermal power plants. Considering the variety of ways heat can be generated, a more comprehensive answer to the question would be \\"Heat can be generated through various processes, including electrical energy, metabolic processes in mammals, chemical reactions, friction, nuclear reactions, solar radiation, and geothermal activity.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The city's Albert Einstein Hospital issued a statement Saturday saying the football legend -- born Edson Arantes do Nascimento -- was improving but still in intensive care battling an illness. Pele is lucid, talking and responding to antibiotics, the hospital said. He remains on temporary dialysis, which was a reason he was moved to the ICU in the first place, because the machine he needed was there. The hospital issued a second statement later Saturday, indicating that Pele continues to recover and that doctors plan to take him off dialysis early Sunday. Earlier this week, the 74-year-old was admitted to the medical facility -- the same place he recently underwent surgery to remove kidney stones -- for a urinary tract infection. The athletic icon had one kidney removed during this days as a player, his aide, Jose Fornos Rodrigues, told CNN.

The longtime Dean of the United States Senate served as its president pro tempore and chairman of both its Rules and Administration and Appropriations committees . He was a member of the Democratic Party . Having earned a reputation as a reclamation expert early in his congressional career , Hayden consistently backed legislation dealing with public lands , mining , reclamation , and other projects affecting the Western United States . In addition , he played a key role in creating the funding formula for the federal highway system . President John F. Kennedy said of Hayden , \`\` Every Federal program which has contributed to the development of the West -- irrigation , power , reclamation -- bears his mark , and the great Federal highway program which binds this country , together , which permits this State to be competitive east and west , north and south , this in large measure is his creation . '' Known as the \`\` Silent Senator '' , Hayden rarely spoke on the Senate floor . Instead his influence came from committee meetings and Senate cloakroom discussions where his comments were given a respect comparable to canon law . A colleague said of him , \`\` No man in Senate history has wielded more influence with less oratory , '' while the Los Angeles Times wrote that Hayden had \`\` assisted so many projects for so many senators that when old Carl wants something for his beloved Arizona , his fellow senators fall all over themselves giving him a hand .

Denmark is still neutral, but (Danish) Captain Andersen (Conrad Veidt) and his freighter Helvig are stopped in the English Channel by Lt. Commanders Ashton (Joss Ambler) and Ellis (Harold Warrender) for a cargo inspection in a British Contraband Control Port. He receives two shore passes for himself and his First Officer Axel Skold (Hay Petrie) to dine with Ashton and Ellis, but the passes (and Helvig's motorboat) are stolen by passengers Mrs. Sorensen (Valerie Hobson) and talent scout Mr. Pidgeon (Esmond Knight). From a cut-out newspaper train schedule, Andersen is able to figure out they are taking a train to London and catches up with them; but, when the train arrives in the blacked-out metropolis, he is only able to hold on to Sorensen. He invites her to dine at the restaurant of Skold's brother Erik (also Hay Petrie).

Given the below context: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The portion of the marginal cost curve above its intersection with the average variable cost curve is the supply curve for a firm operating in a perfectly competitive market. (the portion of the MC curve below its intersection with the AVC curve is not part of the supply curve because a firm would not operate at price below the shutdown point) This is not true for firms operating in other market structures. For example, while a monopoly \`\`has'' an MC curve it does not have a supply curve. In a perfectly competitive market, a supply curve shows the quantity a seller's willing and able to supply at each price -- for each price, there is a unique quantity that would be supplied. The one-to-one relationship simply is absent in the case of a monopoly. With a monopoly, there could be an infinite number of prices associated with a given quantity. It all depends on the shape and position of the demand curve and its accompanying marginal revenue curve. Can we conclude that is the marginal cost curve the supply curve?","completion":"Sure, little buddy! Let me explain it in a simple way. In a perfectly competitive market, where businesses are like players in a big game, each one tries to offer the best deal. These businesses are called firms. Now, imagine you have a lemonade stand. The more lemonade you make, the higher the cost you need to pay to make it. This is called the \\"marginal cost\\", or the cost of making one more glass of lemonade. The \\"supply curve\\" shows how much of something, like lemonade, the businesses want to sell based on the price people pay for it. In this big game, players or firms are more likely to make and sell lemonade when they can cover their costs, which means they make enough money to stay in the game. So, at that point, the marginal cost curve is like the supply curve for those firms. But, not all businesses play in the perfectly competitive market. Some are like the king of their own game, and they're called \\"monopolies\\". For them, it's not as simple as their marginal cost curve being their supply curve. They can set different prices for the same amount of their \\"thing\\", so we can't say their marginal cost curve is like their supply curve."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

She had always been in good shape during high school, but now, in her first year of college, she was suddenly ten pounds heavier. \\"My friends and I often had pizza or ice cream when we studied late at night,\\" she said, \\"and I was always drinking Coke to stay awake.\\" Celia's experience is common. Many students enter college and find it so different that they cannot deal with changes properly. They're away from their parents and in a new stressful environment. Pressures together with freedom to sleep and eat however they please cause many students to experience the \\"Freshman 15\\": gaining weight suddenly in their freshman year of college. Most students do not realize that the \\"Freshman 15\\" can cause some serious health problems. Of course, college-age adults are still developing bone mass, so gaining some weight is normal. Sudden weight gain, however, puts too much strain on the heart and lungs, resulting in little energy and some difficulty thinking and remembering. In later life, it can lead to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and possibly cancer. The solution to the \\"Freshman 15\\" is simple--pay attention to developing good habits! In general: * Eat normal-sized meals at regular times. Eat slowly and enjoy it, so you don't need to go back for more. * Keep only healthy snacks in your room--and don't snack too often! * Control drinking and smoking.

Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.

The Canaries, unbeaten since their opening day defeat at Wolves, were awful during the first half and deservedly trailed to goals from Joe Ralls and Aron Gunnarsson. But quickfire strikes from Martin Olsson and Wes Hoolahan levelled matters early in the second half, before Michael Turner and substitute Cameron Jerome finished the job. Norwich's second-half fightback saw the Canaries claw back from a two-goal deficit to win 4-2. Four goals in Norwich's second-half fightback saw the Canaries win 4-2 against Cardiff City.

Subs (not used): Odjidja-Ofoe, Whittaker, Murphy, Rudd,. Bookings: Lafferty, Turner. Goals: Olsson (54), Hoolahan (58), Turner (71), Jerome (87) Such an outcome had looked highly unlikely as Cardiff, challenged to prove their Championship title credentials by manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, raced out of the traps. Inside a minute Kenwyne Jones had seen his goalwards glancing header hacked clear, but there was no reprieve for Norwich in the fourth minute. Ralls seized on Turner's loose pass and drove beyond Alex Tettey to send a left-footed drive into the bottom corner. It was the young midfielder's second league goal for the Bluebirds, almost three years after his first. The visitors were all at sea although Kyle Lafferty almost levelled with a curling strike which David Marshall did well to punch away to safety. Norwich fell further behind in the 22nd minute. Jones played in Anthony Pilkington down the right, and his cross was expertly tucked home by Gunnarsson. Having dominated the opening half an hour Cardiff sowed the seeds of their own downfall by surrendering the initiative during the final 15 minutes of the half and, aside from one excellent John Ruddy stop to deny Federico Macheda's volley, they were not to regain it. Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson doubles Cardiff's lead in the first half as Norwich struggled to get a foothold. Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson runs away in celebration after doubling Cardiff's lead over a frustrated Norwich side. Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson is joined by Anthony Pilkington as the pair celebrate going 2-0 up. Cardiff let their 2-0 lead from the first half slip as a disastrous second 45 minutes saw Norwich net four times. The loss of Fabio to injury weakened the left-side of the Cardiff defence, with Declan John on in his place, and Norwich took full advantage. Firstly Hoolahan was given far too much room to get a ball into Lewis Grabban in the 54th minute. The in-form striker could not turn Sean Morrison but the ball fell kindly for Olsson to slot home from close range, on the Swede's return to the side after his ban for pushing referee Simon Hooper. Four minutes later Norwich were level. Nathan Redmond evaded Ralls and John to deliver a pinpoint cross for Jerome to power a header straight at Marshall, who could do nothing as Hoolahan gleefully dispatched the follow-up. Cardiff were rocked and they fell behind with 19 minutes to play. Tettey found space down the Norwich right and Russell Martin's mis-hit shot was turned in by Turner as Marshall appealed in vain for offside. The Bluebirds responded with Whittingham twice working Ruddy, and Turner being fortunate to only receive a booking after bringing down Nicky Maynard with the substitute through on goal. But former Cardiff striker Cameron Jerome put the result beyond doubt three minutes from time. Splintering the hosts' offside trap to round Marshall before tucking home. Neil Adams celebrates Norwich's 4-2 win at the end of the game after clawing back from 2-0 down at half time.","completion":"In an exciting Championship match at the Cardiff City Stadium, Norwich City produced an astonishing second-half fightback to claim a 4-2 victory over Cardiff City. Despite an underwhelming performance by Norwich in the first half, the Canaries managed to turn things around with an impressive display after the break. Cardiff kicked off the game in full force and took the lead in the fourth minute with a goal from young midfielder Joe Ralls. They continued to dominate the first half as Aron Gunnarsson doubled their lead in the 22nd minute with a fine finish, giving Cardiff a comfortable 2-0 lead going into halftime. However, Norwich emerged from the break with renewed energy and determination. Quickfire strikes from Martin Olsson in the 54th minute and Wes Hoolahan in the 58th helped the Canaries level the score at 2-2. As the game approached its final stages, Michael Turner put Norwich in the lead in the 71st minute, and substitute Cameron Jerome sealed the victory with a goal in the 87th minute. Norwich's comeback was notably aided by Cardiff's loss of Fabio to injury, which weakened their left-side defence. Additionally, Norwich's tactical adjustments and efficient use of substitutes contributed to their stunning comeback. This victory extends Norwich's unbeaten run after their opening day defeat at Wolves, while Cardiff will be left to rue their inability to hold on to a two-goal lead. The final score was: Cardiff City 2, Norwich City 4. Goals for Cardiff came from Joe Ralls (4) and Aron Gunnarsson (22), while Norwich's goals were scored by Martin Olsson (54), Wes Hoolahan (58), Michael Turner (71), and Cameron Jerome (87)."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology? ? The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter.

Choices: (I) yes; (II) it is not possible to tell; (III) no;","completion":"(I) Yes, it is possible to conclude that \\"Usually, a limited edition of anything has some value later.\\" This claim is supported by the logic that limited edition items tend to hold or increase in value over time due to their rarity, exclusivity, and collectible nature. There are several reasons why limited edition items hold or gain value over time: 1. Rarity: Limited edition items are produced in limited quantities, which means there are only a certain number of these items available in the market. This rarity makes them more valuable as they are sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. 2. Exclusivity: Limited edition items are often marketed as exclusive products, giving the buyers a sense of prestige and uniqueness. This exclusivity factor can enhance their desirability and may result in a higher value in the future. 3. Collectability: Some limited edition items become more collectible over time. For example, limited edition books, coins, stamps, or artwork can accumulate more historical and cultural significance as time passes, thus increasing their value. 4. Quality: Limited edition items typically have a higher quality and craftsmanship compared to mass-produced items. This enhanced quality can enhance the long-term value of the product. 5. Demand: If the demand for an item increases over time, and if the supply of that item is limited, the value of the item can increase by the basic principles of supply and demand. However, it is important to note that not all limited edition items will necessarily increase in value or hold their value over time. Some factors, such as changes in consumer preferences, market conditions, or the condition of the item, can negatively affect the future value. Additionally, the value of limited edition items can be subjective and can depend on the specific interests and preferences of collectors or enthusiasts. In conclusion, although there may be exceptions and factors that could affect the future value of some limited edition items, we can generally say that \\"Usually, a limited edition of anything has some value later.\\" This claim is based on the rarity, exclusivity, collectability, quality, and demand associated with limited edition items."},{"prompt":"Q: You are given an original reference as well as a system generated reference.

Here is a news article: The four people that authorities thought were missing since a twin-engine aircraft crashed Thursday morning on top of a building at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport apparently are the same four who were confirmed dead earlier in the day, authorities said. The pilot, retired air traffic controller Mark Goldstein, was the only one on board the plane. ||||| The Beechcraft King Air B200 that crashed Thursday morning at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport was manufactured 15 years ago and had been reacquired by its manufacturer earlier this fall. Federal Aviation Administration records show Beechraft Corp. at 10511 E. Central was the registered owner of the twin-engine turboprop airplane that received its airworthiness certificate on Dec. 18, 1999. The airplane’s prior owner was Sheetz Inc., an Altoona, Pa.-based convenience store chain, said Sheetz spokeswoman Tarah Arnold. “We sold the plane on Sept. 25 … back to Beechcraft,” Arnold said. An official from Textron Aviation, the owner of Beechcraft, said in an e-mail to The Eagle on Thursday that the company would not comment on any stories related to Thursday’s crash because it has been “invited” to participate in the National Transportation Safety Board investigation. That investigation has just begun, and no conclusions about the cause of the deadly crash are expected for months. It typically takes more than a year for the NTSB to render a final report for an airplane crash, although it often releases preliminary data sooner. Two aviation experts described the King Air line of airplanes as reliable. “The 200 was the first King Air with a T-tail,” said David Bernstorf of BSC Consulting, who was an engineer at Beechcraft and its predecessor companies for 37 years. “When I came to work at Beech, that was the first project I was assigned to.” Bernstorf said there have been a number of variations since the 200, the original certification of which was in December 1973. He said the B200 model, the type in Thursday’s crash, featured upgraded engines and an upgrade to its four-blade propellers. “It’s a pretty rugged airplane, has good performance,” he said. “It’s been around forever, and it’s a workhorse,” said John Eakin, owner of Texas-based Air Data Research. Eakin is a commercially licensed pilot and aircraft mechanic, and his company analyzes aircraft safety and crash information. He also said the Pratt & Whitney turbine engines that power the King Air have the same characteristics as the airplane. “It’s a good, solid engine that’s been around forever,” Eakin said. He said the King Air traces its history back to the Beech Queen Air in the 1950s. “Just offhand, I can’t think of any really spectacular problem that’s been found on them,” Eakin said. “A lot of airplanes are known for problems. The King Air isn’t known for anything bad.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"An airplane called the Beechcraft King Air B200 crashed at an airport.

Police say Zaevion was shot dead by gang members while trying to shield three young girls from the gunfire. \\"It was an honor for my son to protect another individual,\\" Dobson told CBS News. WVLT Zaevion's brother Zack was there when it happened. \\"I picked him up, and I sat him in my arms, and I was shaking him, and I was like, 'I love you, wake up, I need you, wake up,'\\" he said. Two of the teenage girls who Zaevion shielded from bullets have called the high school football standout a hero. \\"If it wasn't for Zaevion, me or her would have probably been shot,\\" one of them said. \\"I have a military background, that's the actions of heroes,\\" Knoxville police chief David Rausch told CBS News. He said Zaevion was caught in the crossfire of rival gangs. Rausch said one of the gang members who shot at Zaevion was Brandon Perry, who was retaliating after a group of men shot at his home. The chief said Perry ended up being shot and killed by a rival gang less than three hours after he shot at Zaevion. On Sunday, President Obama tweeted about Zaevion.

Zaevion Dobson, who wore jersey number 24 on Fulton High School’s football team, was killed while shielding three girls from random gunfire the previous night. (ADAM LAU/NEWS SENTINEL) By Kristi L. Nelson of the Knoxville News Sentinel There's no memorial on the porch at 2704 Badgett Drive — nothing to suggest a 15-year-old boy died there Thursday night. The yard is empty of crosses or flowers. In the street, neighbors in Lonsdale Homes public housing come and go from work or errands, grill food, play basketball in the street. Knoxville police say Fulton High School sophomore Zaevion Dobson took a bullet there, shielding three teenage girls from a stranger's gunshots. \\"He died laying on top of me,\\" one of the girls, Faith Gordon, said in a Twitter post. \\"That's my brother. Rest easy, Zae. I'll never forget you.\\" Gordon said the shooting happened so quickly, the girls didn't realize Dobson had been shot until after it was over, when he didn't leave the porch to go inside. She didn't say who lived at the apartment, where no one answered the door Saturday. Gordon and more than 100 other people attended a candlelight vigil in Dobson's memory Friday night at nearby Sam E. Hill Park, where the sign for the adjacent community center reads, \\"Remembering Zaevion Dobson, Falcon 24\\" — the jersey number he wore as a starting linebacker on Fulton's varsity football team this past season. Police have called the shooting gang-related, but investigators don't believe Dobson was a target. Police have linked the gunshots that killed him to two other shootings that night: one about three hours earlier, when 46-year-old Lisa Perry was shot at a Dallas Street house, and one about four hours later, when Perry's son Brandon, 23, was shot as his car crashed into an apartment at the Green Hills complex near downtown. He died several hours later. Police said Brandon Perry and Christopher Drone Bassett, 20, who was arrested Friday and charged with being a felon in possession of a gun and violating probation, drove to Lonsdale with another man and fired into the group of teens around 10:12 p.m. Neighbors said the teenagers were walking home after playing basketball at a local recreation center. \\"Most children that age would have ran,\\" said Denitra Cash, who lives between Badgett Drive and the apartment of Dobson's mother, Zenobia Dobson. \\"He didn't. He saved lives.\\" Cash said she grew up with Dobson's mother, well-known in the neighborhood and nicknamed \\"Tinkerbell.\\" Zenobia Dobson raised her three sons to be \\"the kind of boys who get up and go to church, get up and go to school, you don't have to pressure them to do the right thing,\\" Cash said. Cash's 7-year-old son looked up to Dobson and his older brother, Zack, a junior defensive back/wide receiver on Fulton's football team who was featured on ESPN's \\"SportsCenter\\" this fall after catching a pass while doing a back flip in practice. Thursday night's shooting \\"scares me to death,\\" Cash said. Many neighbors around the Badgett Drive apartment are refugees fleeing violence in their home countries in Africa and the Middle East. Hearing gunshots \\"brings back trauma,\\" said one man, who asked not to be identified. Some other neighbors questioned a connection to gang violence, which they said has been less prevalent over the past few years. Instead, they wondered whether it stemmed from jealousy of the brothers' sports talent. But 61-year-old Terry McAfee, who said he's lived in Lonsdale Homes \\"all my life,\\" said gang violence in the complex hasn't really subsided: \\"It's just gone undercover.\\" On Saturday, in a house full of family and friends offering support and prayers, Zenobia Dobson made plans for her son's funeral, set for the day after Christmas at 11 a.m. at Overcoming Believers Church on Harriet Tubman Street, to accommodate the expected crowd that her home church, Martin Chapel United Methodist, can't hold. Dobson asked that those who attend the funeral wear maroon, one of Fulton's school colors. Friends have set up an online GoFundMe account to cover funeral expenses. As of Saturday night, the effort had raised more than 27,000 toward its 30,000 goal. A GoFundMe effort to start a scholarship in Dobson's name had raised more than 1,000 toward its 10,000 goal. Friends and strangers alike have hailed Dobson as a hero on social media, with hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons retweeting a picture of the teen in his Fulton football uniform. Dobson's story gained airtime on CNN, ESPN and the three major TV networks; CBS Nightly News had a satellite truck set up on Fulton's football field Saturday afternoon, taping interviews with football coach Rob Black and others. Andre Canty, president of 100 Black Men of Greater Knoxville, said members of the service organization began mentoring Dobson in elementary school, then watched him turn around and mentor younger boys himself in high school. \\"He didn't wait until he was 18 or 19 years old\\" to give back, said Canty, who noted Dobson was involved with Knoxville Mayor Madeline Rogero's Save Our Sons Summit for young black men. \\"A lot of teenagers are not even thinking of someone else. He was a leader.\\" Dobson also worked with younger boys at the Emerald Youth Foundation. The foundation's director, Steve Diggs, is the team's chaplain and led the team in prayer during a meeting Friday, said Ben Conaway, Fulton athletic trainer. \\"We talk a lot about loving God and loving each other as brothers, as family, the importance of that,\\" Conaway said. \\"So that culture is active here already. Now is the time they can take that and really bond together, to grieve and support one another — especially Zack.\\" Members of Fulton's basketball team wrote Dobson's jersey number on their shoes before Friday night's game, Conaway said. A widely shared tagline on social media urged people to \\"Remember his name.\\" At Fulton, that's certain, Conaway said. \\"He treated people really well and loved on his friends a lot and was a joy to be around,\\" Conaway said. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short description of something that includes the main points and important details.

This atmospheric circulation pattern leads to low precipitation and high insolation, resulting in snow lines reaching above 6,500 meters (21,330 feet).

Please write a short summary for the following article: France’s Anthem, ‘La Marseillaise,’ to Unite Soccer Rivals Roy Hodgson, manager of the English national soccer team, said he hoped England's fans would join in singing the French national anthem, \\"La Marseillaise,\\" at the match between the two set for Tuesday. As Michael Cooper noted in The New York Times, the French national anthem, “La Marseillaise,” has emerged as a symbol of defiance and hope in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris last week. On Tuesday, France will play its first major sporting event since the attacks, a friendly soccer game against England at Wembley in London. In soccer, national anthems at sporting events are not always respected by opposing fans. But for this game, English supporters will be encouraged to sing along in solidarity, and the words will be displayed on the big screens to help them. It may be a stirring moment of peaceful unity between two nations with a rivalry dating to Agincourt. But a close look at the song’s lyrics, written at the height of the bloody French Revolution, adds a note of incongruity. “Allons enfants de la Patrie, le jour de gloire est arrivé,” the anthem begins, stirringly. “Arise, children of the fatherland. The day of glory has arrived.” The song then veers quickly into more bellicose language, going on about “L’étendard sanglant” (the bloodstained banner), “féroces soldats” (ferocious soldiers) and, disconcertingly, warning of enemies, “Égorger vos fils, vos compagnes!” (cutting the throats of children and consorts). The conclusion urges citizens, “Qu’un sang impur, abreuve nos sillons!” (“Let impure blood water our furrows.”) Subsequent verses continue the violent imagery, raising the disturbing specters of bloodthirsty tyrants, angry tigers and children sharing their forebears’ coffins. Of course, bombs are “bursting in air” in other national anthems, too. Perhaps when Englishmen and Frenchmen get together to sing off-key on Tuesday, it will be better not to listen too closely.","completion":"A soccer game between France and England is happening on Tuesday.

Question: Who was riding the horse? Movie title: Jane Eyre Movie plot: The movie begins in Gateshead Hall, where a ten-year-old orphan named Jane Eyre is living with her mother's brother's family. The brother, surnamed Reed, dies shortly after adopting Jane. His wife, Mrs. Sarah Reed, and their three children (John, Eliza and Georgiana) neglect and abuse Jane, for they resent Mr. Reed's preference for the little orphan in their midst. In addition, they dislike Jane's plain looks and quiet yet passionate character. Thus, the novel begins with young John Reed bullying Jane, who retaliates with unwonted violence. Jane is blamed for the ensuing fight, and Mrs. Reed has two of the servants drag her off and lock her up in the red-room, the unused chamber where Mr. Reed had died. Still locked in that night, Jane sees a light and panics, thinking that her uncle's ghost has come. Her scream rouses the house, but Mrs. Reed just locks up Jane for longer. Then Jane has a fit and passes out. A doctor, Mr. Lloyd, comes to Gateshead Hall and suggests that Jane go to school.Mr. Brocklehurst is a cold, cruel, self-righteous, and highly hypocritical clergyman who runs a charity school called Lowood. He accepts Jane as a pupil in his school. Jane is infuriated, however, when Mrs. Reed tells him, falsely, that Jane is a liar. After Brocklehurst departs, Jane bluntly tells Mrs. Reed how she hates the Reed family. Mrs. Reed, so shocked that she is scarcely capable of responding, leaves the drawing room in haste.Jane finds life at Lowood to be grim. Miss Maria Temple, the youthful superintendent, is just and kind, but another teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is sour and abusive.

As a professional juggler, he thought his reputation and the admiration from the public would offer a sense of safety and security, allowing them to ignore the early warnings from friends to flee Nazi Germany. Unfortunately, this proved to be a fatal mistake. Hans underestimated the extent of the danger posed by the Nazi regime and ultimately could not protect his family from the tragic consequences. It is clear that Hans grapples with survivor guilt and psychological issues after his experiences in the concentration camp. Throughout his journey in Haifa, Hans repeatedly acts out in fear and panic, demonstrating his inability to process his traumatic past. It is only when he allows himself to connect with others, such as the kibbutz resident Ya'el and the teenage orphan, Josh, that he starts to gain a new perspective on life and find the hope, strength, and support that he needs. In conclusion, Hans Müller initially believed that his fame as a professional juggler would protect him and his family from the impending tragedy during the Nazi regime. However, this proved to be a misguided belief and a grave error in judgment. As Hans embarks on a journey towards healing and acceptance, he learns the importance of connecting with others and facing his past with the support of those who genuinely care for him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As a young teenager at the time, Airwolf was compulsory viewing for a generation who wanted their \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" to have amazing gadgets and whizz-bang explosions. In many ways, the show was essentially Knight Rider in the skies: similar comic-book technology, a central character who was essentially a loner, and echoing the concept of one man making a difference. But in other, important ways, it was thematically very different from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and other action shows of the time. For one thing, the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need, but by Stringfellow Hawke's possession of Airwolf for essentially selfish reasons (as leverage to try to find his MIA brother, St John). And then there is the dark edge provided by basing the series firmly in an 80s Cold War context, complete with Soviet espionage and Central American dictators, not to mention the enemy within. Sure, The A-Team constantly referred back to Vietnam and the team's status as fugitives, but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself. With Airwolf, the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show - although this was (ill-advisedly) diluted as the series went on. With hindsight, the Cold War setting clearly dates the series, many of the stories are creaky and contrived, and much of what Airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology. But that's really not the point. Airwolf was rip-roaring fun, it tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big action sequences, and it didn't sugar-coat everything by miraculously ensuring nobody died. Sometimes it failed, but often it succeeded admirably - and on a TV budget to boot. For UK readers, DMAX (Sky channel 155) have just started (Jan 2008) daily re-runs of Airwolf. Set your Sky+ box for this blast from the past - we may even get the re-tooled, re-cast (and sadly vastly inferior) fourth season, which to my knowledge has never previously been shown in the UK.

Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions. Paragraph: Stef is a young girl interested in the geography of the world. For her birthday, she got two different representations of the Earth. Her grandparents gave her a map that uses the Mercator projection and her uncle gave her a globe. She is comparing how certain countries look differently on the two gifts and trying to figure out why that is. She is specifically looking at Norway, a country near the North Pole, and Mexico, a country close to the equator. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country will be less misshapen on the map?","completion":"Based on the paragraph provided and the background information on the Mercator projection, the country that will appear less misshapen on the map is Mexico. This is because Mexico is located closer to the equator in comparison to Norway, which is closer to the North Pole. The Mercator projection becomes more accurate within 15 degrees north or south of the equator, so any landmasses or countries within this zone will be less stretched and distorted in shape. Since Mexico falls within this zone, its representation on the map will be closer to its true dimensions, making it less misshapen compared to Norway, which will likely appear distorted due to its position near the North Pole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The question is asking about the issues or problems encountered with the mechanics of playback and recording, meaning the tangible, physical aspects involved in the procedure of recording and playing back sound. 2. The answer provided details about \\"acoustic limitations\\" which arise from \\"mechanical resonances\\". Acoustic refers to the properties or characteristics of sound. A mechanical resonance, in this context, refers when a system's natural frequency matches the frequency of some external force, potentially leading to damaging oscillations. This implies a tangible (mechanical) problem in creating or retrieving the recorded sound, which fits the requirement of the original question. 3. Moreover, the sentence specifies these issues apply to \\"both the recording and playback system\\". That fulfils the question’s requirement to address problems in both playback and recording mechanics. So, the answer provided does present a valid explanation to the issues related to playback and recording mechanics by elaborating on the impact of mechanical resonances on sound quality during the recording and playback process."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

Options: - race track - bed - ground - street - subway The answer is \\"street\\" because The answer is:","completion":"\\"street\\" because streets are the most common places where you would find gutters and rubber hitting it regularly. Let's examine each option in detail to understand why the street is the correct answer. 1. Race Track: While it's true that race tracks involve rubber from tires hitting the surface frequently, gutters are not a common feature found on race tracks. Race tracks have specific drainage systems to keep the track dry, and they focus more on efficient water management than traditional gutters. Furthermore, race tracks are more likely to be kept clean from dirt as it can interfere with traction and performance. 2. Bed: Beds would not have gutters or rubber hitting it regularly. A bed is meant for sleeping, and it generally remains indoors, away from gutters and rubber. Therefore, it can be ruled out as an option for this question. 3. Ground: The ground is a broad term and could refer to any surface of the Earth. While gutters and rubber might exist on specific types of ground, such as a street, it's not specific enough to accurately answer this question. 4. Street: A street is a paved public thoroughfare typically found in urban areas. Streets are engineered with drainage systems that include gutters to manage rainwater and prevent flooding. Additionally, streets are designed for wheeled vehicles, including cars and bicycles, with rubber tires that make contact with the street surface regularly. Dirt can accumulate on streets and in gutters from a variety of sources, such as wind, erosion, and regular traffic. Therefore, \\"street\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question as it satisfies both conditions: having gutters and rubber hitting it regularly. 5. Subway: Subways refer to an underground railway system found in various large cities. While subways might have drainage systems in place, the term \\"gutter\\" is not typically associated with subways. Additionally, the rubber from tires is not applicable to subway trains as they operate on steel rails. Dirt might be found inside subway stations, but the probability of finding a gutter and encountering rubber is low. In conclusion, out of the given options, \\"street\\" is the most suitable answer to the question of where one might find dirt in a place with a gutter and rubber hitting it regularly. Streets are designed to manage rainwater through gutters and accommodate vehicles with rubber tires, making it a prime location for dirt to accumulate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Throw away anything that is expired, spoiled, or otherwise inedible. While you're at it, you might want to.","completion":"While you're at it, you might want to thoroughly clean the interior of your fridge, including shelves, drawers, and door compartments. This will not only remove any lingering smells or stains, but it will also make it easier to see the contents of your fridge when you are trying to find specific items. Once you have cleaned your fridge, it is time to take inventory of its contents and organize them into different categories. Organizing your fridge according to food groups or zones can greatly simplify the process of finding what you need. Some common categories include: dairy, meats, fruits and vegetables, condiments, and leftovers. Furthermore, you can also separate items that need to be consumed quickly from those with a longer shelf-life, which can help reduce the amount of food that goes to waste. To make these categories easy to identify, consider the use of clear, labeled bins or containers for each group of items. This will be particularly helpful for smaller items, such as yogurts or fruit cups, that can easily become lost in the depths of the fridge if not properly corralled. Another important aspect of organizing your fridge is the placement of items according to temperature requirements. The bottom shelf and drawers are typically the coldest areas in the fridge, making them ideal for storing meats, poultry, and fish. In contrast, the top shelf and door compartments tend to be warmer, which is better for items like condiments and other non-perishable foods. Take advantage of your refrigerator's adjustable shelves and compartments to maximize space and functionality. Arrange shelves so that taller items can easily fit without obstructing your view of the fridge's contents. Use the door compartments to store frequently accessed items, like milk and juice, as well as condiments and dressings so you can quickly grab them without holding the door open for too long. Drawers should also be used effectively, with separate areas for fruits and vegetables to prevent spoilage and cross-contamination. In addition to categorizing and organizing your fridge's contents, be sure to rotate items regularly to ensure that older items are used up before they go bad. Check expiration dates frequently, and make a habit of moving items with closer expiration dates to the front, while placing items with longer shelf lives towards the back. This can be particularly helpful with items like yogurt, where new purchases can easily get mixed in with older ones, creating a confusing jumble of expiration dates. Lastly, maintaining an up-to-date inventory list of the contents of your refrigerator can be a helpful tool in preventing food waste and making it easier to find items when needed. By keeping a list on the outside of your refrigerator door, you can easily see what items are available without having to dig through the entire fridge. Plus, this can also come in handy when planning meals or creating shopping lists, as you'll have a clear understanding of what you already have on hand. In conclusion, making it easier to find things in your fridge can be achieved through regular cleaning and organization, categorizing and separating items, maximizing the use of compartments, rotating items according to expiration dates, and maintaining an updated inventory list. By implementing these strategies, you'll not only save time and energy when searching for specific items, but also reduce food waste and enjoy a more efficient and organized refrigerator."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Visitor Q Movie plot: The film's plot is often compared to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema, in which a strange visitor to a wealthy family seduces the maid, the son, the mother, the daughter, and finally the father, before leaving a few days after, subsequently changing their lives.[5] The film starts off with a question: \\"Have you ever done it with your Dad?\\"; the viewer then sees Miki Yamazaki, a young prostitute, trying to persuade her father, Kiyoshi, into having sex with her. Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten. Her young son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him. He then hits his mother with a rug beating stick. Later, bullies from the son's school come to the front of the house and shoot fireworks through the son's bedroom window. The mother is later seen injecting heroin. It does not seem to have a huge effect on her, though, suggesting she is a regular user.

Craig has to read a lot more contracts than Christopher because","completion":"Craig is a successful corporate lawyer in a thriving downtown firm, while Christopher is a small-town attorney who mainly deals with family law, real estate, and simple litigation matters. Although they both enjoy their respective fields, the complexity and volume of the contracts Craig encounters daily far surpass what Christopher needs to keep up with. As a result, Craig often finds himself spending hours poring over pages of legal jargon packed with technicalities and hidden loopholes. In the cutthroat world of corporate law, multi-million and billion-dollar deals hinge on the details, making the stakes incredibly high. Large corporations, eagerly seeking to enter into strategic partnerships, find themselves in a complex web of contract negotiations, acquisitions, and intellectual property issues. For Craig, thoroughly reviewing contracts is critical for ensuring that his clients are protected, their risks minimized, and their rights and interests secured. Moreover, Craig is responsible for drafting and editing comprehensive agreements, a task that demands meticulous attention to detail, a deep understanding of commercial and contract law, and an immense dedication to research. This further compounds the challenges and time commitments Craig faces on a never-ending basis. On the other hand, Christopher's rural practice typically involves straight-forward transactions and contracts that do not demand the same degree of scrutiny. For instance, his drafting of a will or handling a real estate purchase agreement hardly compares to the complexities of multi-party, international deals that Craig regularly contends with. Furthermore, Christopher's clients typically do not have the resources to enter into incredibly dense and extensive legal agreements, meaning they likely prefer simple yet effective contracts that can quickly and painlessly get the job done. Despite the apparent chasm between the workloads of Craig and Christopher, both lawyers bring certain virtues to the table. Craig's extensive experience in the labyrinth of corporate law equips him with unique insights and strategies for managing ambitious business deals. His ability to distill complex legal matters into actionable and accessible terms is something many clients prize. On the other hand, Christopher's interpersonal skills and knowledge of local law and regulations make him indispensable to his clients, who require a more intimately tailored approach to their legal matters. As a small-town attorney, Christopher knows the importance of being accessible and empathetic, and he strives to build lasting relationships, making himself a prominent figure in his community. In the end, the reason Craig has to read a lot more contracts than Christopher ultimately boils down to their respective legal specializations and clientele. While both lawyers face unique challenges, their individual skill sets allow them to thrive in their particular environments, serving the diverse needs of both small, local clients and large, international corporations. By embracing their differences, each attorney exemplifies the power of boundless dedication and boundless expertise in the ever-evolving world of law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"\\"Tickle\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the action of making each other laugh.

Step 1: Analyze the question The question is: \\"The children were making each other laugh, they did this via what?\\" The key information in the question is that \\"children were making each other laugh.\\" So, we are looking for an activity that can result in laughter. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers Now, let's evaluate the possible answers considering the information from the question. a. Play ball: While playing ball can be fun, it doesn't directly cause laughter between children. It may create some fun moments, but it's not the primary source of laughter in this context. b. Reading a book: Reading a book is generally an individual and silent activity that doesn't typically involve making others laugh. c. Jump rope: Like playing ball, jump rope can be an enjoyable activity, but it doesn't necessarily generate laughter between children. It is more about physical fitness and fun. d. Tickle: Tickling is an action that directly targets laughter. When someone tickles another person, it usually elicits an involuntary laughter response. Since the question mentions that the children were making each other laugh, tickling aligns well with this premise. e. See exhibits: Viewing exhibits is generally a passive activity that doesn't actively involve making each other laugh. Step 3: Determine the answer with the best alignment Based on the evaluation in the previous step, \\"tickle\\" is the answer that is most aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the act of making each other laugh, which is the core information provided in the question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

President Trump will propose a federal budget that would significantly increase defense-related spending by 54 billion while cutting other federal agencies by the same amount, an administration official said.

According to the White House, the defense budget would increase by 10 percent. Trump also will request 30 billion in supplementary military spending for fiscal 2017, an administration official said. But without providing specifics, the administration said that most other discretionary spending programs would be cut to pay for it. Officials singled out foreign aid, one of the smallest parts of the federal budget, saying it would face “large reductions” in spending. [Budget breakdown: What the Obama White House wants to spend money on] (Reuters) It is the first indication of spending priorities by the new administration, with the president set to arrive on Capitol Hill on Tuesday night for a speech to a joint session of Congress. But the full budget negotiations between Trump and Congress will not be complete for many months. In a statement at the White House on Monday morning, Trump said that his budget would put “America first” by focusing on defense, law enforcement and veterans using money previously spent abroad. “We are going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable to the people,” he said. “We can do so much more with the money we spend.” [Analysis: The U.S. foreign-aid budget, visualized] The White House did not specify how Trump’s budget would address mandatory spending or taxes, promising that those details would come later.

Social Security costs totaled about 910 billion last year, and Medicare outpaced defense spending with a total cost of 588 billion. Medicaid, interest payments on debt and miscellaneous costs made up an additional 1.2 trillion. White House officials declined to answer questions about the president’s priorities on a host of other fiscal issues, including infrastructure improvements and plans to pay for a wall between the United States and Mexico. Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), emphasized that the priorities outlined Monday do not reflect policy on broader fiscal issues, which he said will be addressed later. “We are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars,” Mulvaney told reporters. “A full budget will contain the entire spectrum of what the president has proposed.” (Reuters) Defense spending accounts for almost the same proportion of the federal budget as all non-discretionary domestic spending, meaning that the Trump administration’s proposal will result in a roughly 10 percent across-the-board cut in all other federal spending programs. Budgets for most federal agencies would be reduced substantially, said an OMB official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on a call with reporters to discuss the proposal. The announcement marks the beginning of a process in which the OMB will coordinate with agencies to flesh out the plan. Trump said his budget, which will be submitted to Congress next month, will propose “historic” increases in spending to bolster the country’s “depleted military,” and he said it will support law enforcement in an effort to reduce crime. [Trump team plans for infrastructure ‘task force’ to advance top spending priority] Trump noted that the country faces an urgent infrastructure problem, which he promised during the campaign that he would address with a 1 trillion infrastructure spending plan. Although the administration has not yet outlined whether infrastructure will be part of Trump’s budget proposal, the president spoke about it at length before a gathering of governors at the White House on Monday. “We’re going to make it easier for states to invest in infrastructure,” he said. “We spent 6 trillion in the Middle East, and we have potholes all over our highways and our roads.” He added: “Infrastructure, we’re going to start spending on infrastructure — big.” Republicans in Congress expect that the details released this week will be the first elements of a broader budget that will be rolled out next month. The Trump administration is expected to release a pared-down “skinny budget” the week of March 13 and a fuller list of requests by the end of March or early April, said multiple Republican congressional aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the process. Democrats have warned that under the current circumstances, Trump would be hard-pressed to make significant cuts to domestic programs without significantly reducing some government services. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday that the scant details the Trump administration released probably would lead to cuts to widely used programs. “A cut this steep almost certainly means cuts to agencies that protect consumers from Wall Street excess and protect clean air and water,” Schumer said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) added that deep reductions could have a major effect on programs that keep the American workforce competitive. “A 54 billion cut will do far-reaching and long-lasting damage to our ability to meet the needs of the American people and win the jobs of the future,” she said in a statement. “The President is surrendering America’s leadership in innovation, education, science and clean energy.” Individual agencies were expected to begin the customary process of sending budget requests for the upcoming fiscal year to the White House beginning Monday, the aides said. The OMB will then begin drafting an official request for fiscal 2018 and submit it to Congress in the coming weeks. Congress typically does not agree with the White House budget in full, even when the president and congressional leaders represent the same party. Republican leaders have not yet said when they will release their budget blueprint for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) told members at a GOP retreat in Philadelphia in January that he expects to act by July on a 2018 budget proposal that will lay out major spending cuts and begin the process of rewriting the tax code.

The White House took its first steps Monday toward what would be a dramatic reshuffling of the 3 trillion-plus federal budget, sending guidance to agencies that calls for a 54 billion increase in defense spending and corresponding reductions to most non-security agencies. While Office of Management and Budget officials briefed reporters on the plan this morning, President Donald Trump publicly explained his proposal to focus federal spending on national security, including boosts to the military, local law enforcement and the Border Patrol, while cutting domestic programs and foreign aid. Trump has said his budget will not include cuts to Medicare or Social Security, the usual targets of Republicans trying to trim federal spending. Story Continued Below “This budget follows through on my promise of keeping America safe, keeping out terrorists, keeping out criminals and putting violent offenders behind bars or removing them from our country altogether,” he said. The White House has not yet defined the depth of cuts to particular programs. But some targets, such as the EPA, are in the cross-hairs of conservative groups that want severe reductions in programs such as the Obama administration's climate initiatives. OMB Director Mick Mulvaney said Monday afternoon the Trump administration’s fiscal 2018 budget would include 462 billion in domestic funding and 603 billion in defense spending. The proposed defense total is a 54 billion increase above the Budget Control Act spending caps for defense. Mulvaney called it one of the “largest increases in history.” But the Obama administration also proposed a defense budget that busted the spending caps in fiscal 2018, and defense hawks in Congress were not happy with Monday’s announcement. “Such a budget request would represent an increase of 18.5 billion above the level proposed by President Obama for fiscal year 2018,” Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in a statement. “In other words, President Trump intends to submit a defense budget that is a mere 3 percent above President Obama’s defense budget, which has left our military underfunded, undersized, and unready to confront threats to our national security.” McCain and House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) have proposed a defense budget of 640 billion for fiscal 2018. Trump said the proposed increase in military spending “will be offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the federal government.” He didn’t offer specifics, though he pointed to recent attempts to negotiate military contracts, adding, “We cut the hell out of the prices.” OMB officials declined to comment on how hard the funding reductions would hit the EPA, which now has an 8.1 billion budget. But they did note the proposal would conform to Trump’s campaign pledges to take an ax to the agency. (The president promised on the campaign trail to \\"get rid of it in almost every form,\\" leaving only \\"little tidbits left.\\") Foreign aid, which makes up about 1 percent of the federal budget, will also be heavily targeted. “This budget expects the rest of the world to step up in some of the programs this country has been so generous in funding in the past,” an OMB official said. The president said he would “substantially” increase spending to law enforcement, on the local and federal levels, blasting violent crime in urban areas like Chicago. The Trump administration has not said how much money it will ask Congress to spend in total, or from where the cuts would come. Administration officials have said Trump’s budget blueprint will not touch entitlement programs or other mandatory spending, which makes up about two-thirds of federal spending each year. Trump hinted that he would provide some additional details in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, when he is expected to lay out his priorities for his first year. The White House will propose a full budget “later in the year,” but the budget “blueprint” agencies will now work on is expected by mid-March, the OMB officials said. Trump hinted that budget would adhere to fiscal standards, in line with previous remarks from close advisers like OMB Director Mick Mulvaney. “With the 20 trillion in debt, the government must learn to tighten its belt,” Trump said. But he also made clear he planned to stick with his big-ticket agenda items like infrastructure. Lamenting the state of the nation’s roads, bridges and tunnels, Trump promised massive investments nationwide. “We’re going to take care of that. We’re going to start spending on infrastructure, big,” Trump said. ||||| President Donald Trump speaks to a meeting of the National Governors Association,Monday, Feb. 27, 2017, at the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press) President Donald Trump speaks to a meeting of the National Governors Association,Monday, Feb. 27, 2017, at the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House says President Donald Trump's upcoming budget will propose a whopping 54 billion increase in defense spending and impose corresponding cuts to domestic programs and foreign aid. The result is that Trump's initial budget wouldn't dent budget deficits projected to run about 500 billion. White House budget officials outlined the information during a telephone call with reporters given on condition of anonymity. The budget officials on the call ignored requests to put the briefing on the record, even though Trump on Friday decried the use of anonymous sources by the media. Trump's defense budget and spending levels for domestic agency operating budgets will be revealed in a partial submission to Congress next month, with proposals on taxes and other programs coming later. The big, approximately 10 percent increase for the Pentagon would fulfill a Trump campaign promise to build up the military. The senior budget office official said there will be a large reduction in foreign aid and that most domestic agencies will have to absorb cuts. He did not offer details, but the administration is likely to go after longtime Republican targets like the Environmental Protection Agency. Tentative proposals for the 2018 budget year that begins Oct. 1 are being sent to agencies, which will have a chance to propose changes to the cuts as part of a longstanding tradition at the budget office. Trump's budget, once finalized and sent to Congress in mid-March, is sure to set off a huge Washington battle. Democrats and some Republicans are certain to resist the cuts to domestic agencies, and any legislation to implement them would have to overcome a filibuster threat by Senate Democrats. A government shutdown is a real possibility. Trump's budget also won't make significant changes to Social Security or Medicare, according to an administration official. Capitol Hill aides confirmed details of the upcoming blueprint on the condition of anonymity to discuss information that's not yet been made public. Trump's first major fiscal marker will land in the agencies one day before his first address to a joint session of Congress. For Trump, the primetime speech is an opportunity to refocus his young presidency on the core economic issues that were a centerpiece of his White House run. The upcoming submission covers the budget year starting on Oct. 1. But first there's an April 28 deadline to finish up the unfinished spending bills for the ongoing 2017 budget year, which is almost half over, and any stumble or protracted battle could risk a government shutdown then as well. The March release is also expected to include an immediate infusion of 2017 cash for the Pentagon that's expected to register about 20 billion or so and contain the first wave of funding for Trump's promised border wall and other initiatives like hiring immigration agents. The president previewed a boost in military spending during a speech Friday to conservative activists, pledging \\"one of the greatest build-ups in American history.\\" \\"We will be substantially upgrading all of our military, all of our military, offensive, defensive, everything, bigger and better and stronger than ever before,\\" he said. In an interview with Fox News Channel's \\"Sunday Morning Futures,\\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said cuts to Social Security and Medicare would not be part of the administration's first budget. Trump's priority is passing legislation to reduce middle-class and corporate taxes, he said. As a candidate, Trump promised to leave major entitlements untouched, breaking with some Republican leaders who believe the costly programs need to be reformed. The White House budget office issued a statement confirming that an interim budget submission will be released in mid-March but declining to comment on an \\"internal discussion.\\" \\"The president and his Cabinet are working collaboratively to create a budget that keeps the president's promises to secure the country and restore fiscal sanity to how we spend American taxpayers' money,\\" said Office of Management and Budget spokesman John Czwartacki. Czwartacki said that the March submission would only address agency operating budgets funded by Congress and that proposals on tax reform and so-called mandatory programs — they include food stamps, student loans, health programs and farm subsidies — will be released later. By increasing defense and leaving Medicare and Social Security untouched, the Trump final budget plan is sure to project sizable deficits. In the campaign Trump promised huge tax cuts but top GOP leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin don't want this year's tax reform drive to add to the budget deficit. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"President Trump plans to propose a federal budget that would increase defense spending by 54 billion while cutting federal agencies by the same amount, according to an administration official.

He is too cocky to be concerned when she reveals that she is the girlfriend of well-known gangster Willie Ryan. When Willie finds out, Belle reassures him she is in control of her emotions. Willie is not so certain about that, but is too shrewd to have Steve killed out of hand by his bodyguard, whom he jokingly calls his \\"Adopted Son\\" (Robert McWade).

The data provided gives us some insightful information about the restaurant that can be broken down into a detailed description of its offerings and atmosphere. First and foremost, the cuisine offered by Blue Spice is classified as fast food, which implies that the restaurant focuses on quick, convenient, and delicious meals. This may include a variety of dishes such as burgers, sandwiches, wraps, fries, and other on-the-go meal options that can be easily enjoyed by individuals who are pressed for time or are looking for an easy dining option. Despite offering fast food options, the price range at Blue Spice is notably higher than what one would typically expect for this cuisine type. With prices starting at £30 and above per meal, the restaurant is considered more upscale in comparison to most fast food joints. This higher price range could be attributed to factors such as the quality of ingredients used, gourmet-style preparation or cooking methods, unique flavors or menu options, and the overall ambiance and service provided at Blue Spice.

You should say \\"Thank you\\" when someone passes you the salt on the table, when someone walking ahead of you keeps the door open for you, when someone says you have done your work well, or you have bought a nice thing, or your city is very beautiful. \\"Thank you\\" is used not only between friends, but also between parents and children, brothers and sisters. \\"Excuse me\\" is another short sentence they use. When you hear someone say so behind you, you know that somebody wants to walk past you without touching you. It's not polite to break others when they are talking.

The new sentence claims that people are running for a fundraising campaign. Although this could be a possible reason for the running event, there is not enough information in the original sentence to deduce this with certainty.

The Nuisance Calls Task Force said cold-callers should not cause \\"severe distress\\" to consumers. Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) cold-callers could face fines of up to 20% of their annual turnover under the proposals. And Ofcom and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) will be able to share information on rogue companies. Up to one billion unwanted phone calls are received by members of the public in the UK each year, the taskforce said. Which? executive director and taskforce chairman Richard Lloyd said many British firms were \\"breaking the law\\". He said companies that were contacting people despite their having \\"opted out\\" of receiving direct marketing calls were acting illegally. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the way in which the law was enforced had not been good enough. Mr Lloyd said the trade in personal data, responsible for the vast majority of nuisance calls, was \\"out of control\\", adding that the \\"market in personal data needs properly investigating and sorting out\\". He also called on regulators to clamp down on the abuse of existing legislation. \\"We want to see business with good reputations that aren't keeping a close enough eye on this making sure that there is someone senior on their board who will be held to account if those nuisance calls are being generated by that businesses activity,\\" Mr Lloyd said. Between April and June this year, 40,000 people complained to the Information Commissioner about unwanted live or automated calls to their phones. Most focused on accident or PPI claims, as well as some debt consolidation company calls. The Nuisance Call Task Force said many consumers did not know that they had unwittingly given their consent to be contacted by these companies.

Crash: The Hawk, carrying an instructor and student pilot, was practising a forced touchdown when it ran into the path of a goose. Unlucky: The unfortunate bird caused the plane to overshoot the runway and smash into a barrier, before landing in a safety net. The crash, which has incredibly left both instructor and pupil unscathed, happened at Mona airfield in mid-Anglesey at 10.50am yesterday. The strip, which is used by trainee pilots, is based at Valley RAF station a few miles away - the same base where Prince William worked as a rescue helicopter pilot until this week. The Hawk T1 plane, powered by a Rolls-Royce turbofan engine, is used by trainee pilots to practise takeoffs and touchdowns. It first entered service with the RAF in 1976, both as an advanced flying-training aircraft and a weapons-training aircraft. Today, the all-metal, low-wing aircraft is used at the Valley base for fast-jet pilot advanced flying training. It is also used by RAF Aerobatic Team and the Red Arrows. A Defence Ministry spokesman said: 'The aircraft was carrying out a practice forced landing. When on the runway, it hit a bird and went into the barrier.'

Information: - The Democratic Alliance (AD), originally called Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD), was a French political party (19011978) created in 1901 by followers of Léon Gambetta, such as Raymond Poincaré who would be president of the Council in the 1920s. The party was at first conceived by members of the Radical-Socialist Party tied to the business world who united themselves in May 1901, along with many moderates, as gathering center-left liberals and \\"Opportunist\\" Republicans (Gambetta, etc.). However, after World War I and the parliamentary disappearance of monarchists and Bonapartists, it quickly became the main center-right party of the Third Republic. It was part of the National Bloc right-wing coalition which won the elections after the end of the war. The ARD successively took the name \\"Parti Républicain Démocratique\\" (Democratic Republican Party, PRD) then \\"Parti Républicain Démocratique et Social\\" (\\"Social and Republican Democratic Party\\"), before becoming again the AD. - Léon Gambetta (2 April 1838 31 December 1882) was a French statesman, prominent during and after the Franco-Prussian War. - The Democratic and Social Action ( French : Action démocratique et sociale , ADS ) was a French parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies of France during the French Third Republic between 1928 and 1932 . The group was formed by the right - wing ( bourgeois and industrialist wing according to André Siegfried ) of the Democratic Republican Alliance , later Democratic Alliance . A number of ADS deputies were formerly members of the most left - wing faction of the Republican Federation , the main conservative party in France which they had left due to the Federation 's evolution to the right . The ADS was resurrected in 1949 by members of the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance ( UDSR ) who joined the Gaullist Rally of the French People ( RPF ) . - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - André Siegfried (April 21, 1875 March 28, 1959) was a French academic, geographer and political writer best known for his commentaries on American, Canadian, and British politics. - The Republican Federation (FR) was the largest conservative party during the French Third Republic, gathering together the liberal Orleanists rallied to the Republic. Founded in November 1903, it competed with the more secular and centrist \\"Alliance démocratique\\" (Democratic Alliance). Later, most deputies of the \\"Fédération républicaine\\" and of \\"Action libérale\\" (which included Catholics rallied to the Republic) joined the \\"Entente républicaine démocratique\\" right-wing parliamentary group. - Vichy (is a city in the Allier department of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in central France, in the historic province of Bourbonnais. - Raymond Nicolas Landry Poincaré (20 August 1860 15 October 1934) was a French statesman who served three times as Prime Minister of France, and as President of France from 1913 to 1920.

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When did the author discover the exhibit Chihuly Garden and Glass?

Here is a goal: To prevent a light from coming in contact with food while using the light to dry the food, you can How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of preventing light from coming in contact with food while using the light to dry the food, one can follow several methods and techniques to ensure that the drying process is hygienic and efficient. The primary challenge is to create an environment where the food can receive enough heat to dry while still being protected from the light source. Here are some detailed steps and suggestions for this process: 1. Choose the right light source: Select a light that generates heat without emitting harmful UV or other wavelengths that could damage the food or cause it to spoil. Infrared lamps and ceramic heat lamps are useful for this purpose as they can generate heat without emitting light that could harm the food. 2. Use a protective barrier: One of the most efficient ways to prevent light from coming into direct contact with the food is by using a protective barrier. A barrier made from an opaque or semi-transparent material can effectively block most of the light while still allowing the heat from the light source to penetrate and dry the food. Examples of suitable materials include food-safe acrylic sheets, frosted glass, or a thin layer of aluminum foil. 3. Design a drying chamber: Create a drying chamber with proper air circulation to keep the food at an appropriate distance from the light source and ensure even drying. The chamber can have multiple levels or shelves where the food can be placed. Set up the light source in a way that generates heat throughout the chamber. Make sure the protective barrier is placed between the food and the light to prevent direct contact. 4. Control temperature and humidity: It is crucial to monitor and maintain the temperature and humidity levels inside the drying chamber, as these factors significantly impact the drying process. You can use a thermometer and hygrometer or a digital temperature and humidity monitor to ensure the conditions remain optimal for food drying. Ideally, temperatures should be maintained between 95°F and 150°F, considering the type of food being dried. 5. Air circulation: Proper air circulation is vital for the even distribution of heat and the removal of moisture released during the drying process. To ensure good air circulation, make provisions for air vents, exhaust fans, or a natural convection system in the drying chamber. This will help in expelling the moist air and maintaining the desired temperature throughout the chamber. 6. Monitor the drying process: Regularly check on your food to ensure that all the pieces are evenly drying. If needed, rearrange the food items or adjust the light source to ensure even distribution of heat. Monitoring the food during the drying process will also help to determine when the food is sufficiently dry and ready to be removed from the chamber. 7. Cleanliness and maintenance: Always keep the drying chamber, light source, and protective barriers clean to prevent contamination. This involves cleaning the area before and after each drying session and regularly inspecting the protective barriers for any signs of wear or damage. By carefully following these steps and precautions, it is possible to prevent light from coming into direct contact with food while using the light to dry the food effectively. This helps maintain the nutritional value, quality, and safety of the dried food products and ensures a successful food drying process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"A: Analyzing the elements in the given product review, it can be inferred that the review is indeed negative. Several factors contribute to this conclusion: 1. Frequency of repairs: The reviewer states that they have had to repair the toy three times within a month from the time of purchase. This reflects a recurring issue with the toy's build quality or components, which negatively impacts its durability and overall performance. 2. Loss of interest: The reviewer's child losing interest in the toy due to its constant breaking is another negative aspect. A toy's primary purpose is to entertain and engage its user. If the child is no longer interested in playing with the toy, it fails to serve its core purpose. Customer dissatisfaction, in this case, is understandable. 3. Concerns regarding the product's construction: By mentioning the toy \\"breaks too much,\\" the reviewer is highlighting the product's flawed design or construction, which is a major drawback.

The following is a detailed account of the key events and interactions that may have led up to the moment when Wentz attempted to distribute the boxes in an orderly fashion. 1. Preparation and planning: Wentz must have planned and prepared for this event. He gathered the 30 pink boxes filled with doughnuts from Winchell's, a step that would involve organizing transportation (the yellow car) and either purchasing the doughnuts or arranging for their donation. 2. Loading the car: With the doughnuts safely in the pink boxes, Wentz would have carefully loaded them into the back of his yellow car, stacking them to ensure they didn't shift or become damaged during the drive to the children's location. 3. Driving to the location: Wentz piloted the yellow car filled with doughnuts through the neighborhood and approached the area where the children were gathered, likely in anticipation of his arrival. He may have felt excitement and anticipation for the joy he would bring to the kids with his surprise. 4. Arrival and attracting attention: The vibrant yellow car, combined with the prospect of receiving doughnuts, would be highly attractive to the children. Upon catching sight of the vehicle, the kids likely started to gather, waving and calling out their excitement. This commotion may have drawn more children to the scene, as they followed the noise and the sight of their peers sprinting towards the car. 5. Evaluating the situation: As the children's excitement continued to grow, Wentz assessed the scene and decided it was time to begin handing out the doughnuts. He must have realized that engaging with the children and keeping their excitement under control was crucial, as it would prevent potential injuries or accidents in the chaos. 6. Gathering the necessary supplies: In order to distribute the doughnuts effectively and efficiently, Wentz needed to have a plan and materials in place. He removed two boxes of doughnuts from the back of the car and placed them on top, preparing to coordinate the distribution process. 7. Interacting with the children: As the children became more eager for the doughnuts and pink boxes, Wentz attempted to greet them and gain their attention. This would have involved speaking to them, possibly instructing them to form a line or listen for directions on how the doughnuts would be distributed. These steps set the stage for Wentz to begin handling out the pink boxes to the children, ensuring they could each receive the sweet treats inside. However, due to the excitement and energy of the kids, events took a chaotic turn with Kendra stealing a doughnut, and Denise and Amber managing to secure their own boxes, while Wentz continued his efforts to maintain order and distribute the remaining pink boxes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One such inefficiency arises from the duplication of effort by firms seeking to develop the same or very similar drugs , though only the first to do so may profit from it due to the winner-takes-all patent system . 3. This leads to brutal races and excessive expenditure of resources to be first over the line and to monopolize the production , at least for a time . 4. These races can thus lead to efforts by firms to steal research from one another , thus resulting in further wastes of resources in engaging and attempting to prevent corporate espionage . 5. Another serious inefficiency arises in the production of similar products to existing ones , seeking to get around existing patents . 6. Such has been the case for years in the pharmaceutical industry , which has succeeded , for example , in curing erectile dysfunction dozens of times . 7. An overemphasis on such spinning off of similar products is the result of patent-generated inefficiency . 8. The inefficiency does not end with production , however , as firms likewise devote great amounts of resources and effort to the development of non-duplicable products , in monitoring for infringement , and in prosecuting offenders , all of which generates huge costs and little or no return . 9.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the first names of the two individuals who met with members of Comité de Madres Monsignor Romero in El Salvador? ? Recording sessions for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a group of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'état that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.Inspired by the mural, Bono took an extended break from recording into July, traveling to Nicaragua and El Salvador with his wife, Alison Hewson, to see first-hand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and US military intervention. While there, they worked with the Central American Mission Partners (CAMP), a human rights and economic development organization. In El Salvador they met members of the Comité de Madres Monsignor Romero (COMADRES: Committee of the Mothers Monsignor Romero), an organization of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Salvadoran government during the Civil War because they opposed the military regime that was in power.

The house had poor wiring while the apartment did not. The Options are: (i). house was more of an insurance liability.; (ii). apartment was more of an insurance liability.;","completion":"The house had poor wiring while the apartment did not. As a result, the house was more of an insurance liability. Step 1: Comparison of the two options The first step is to compare the house and apartment in terms of their safety and the potential risks involved. It is clear that the house has a disadvantage due to its poor wiring, as it could lead to electrical issues and fire hazards. Step 2: Assessing the insurance liabilities Now that we have identified the potential risks associated with the house, we'll need to examine how this could impact insurance premiums and liabilities. An insurance liability is a policyholder's legal obligation for any damages they may cause, in this case, any accidents resulting from the poor wiring. If the house were to result in an electrical fire or other damages due to wiring issues, the homeowner would be held responsible. Step 3: Evaluating the apartment as an option On the other hand, the apartment does not have poor wiring, making it a safer option and less of an insurance liability. It is less likely to result in electrical issues, making it a more attractive option for insurance companies, who would charge lower premiums for coverage. Step 4: Concluding In conclusion, the house with its poor wiring is more of an insurance liability than the apartment. The increased risk associated with the house's wiring issues would result in higher insurance premiums and a greater financial responsibility on the part of the homeowner in case of any damages caused by the poor wiring. Meanwhile, the apartment offers a safer, more reliable living space where the potential for electrical issues and insurance liabilities is significantly lower."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer highlights a significant discrepancy between the model and the actual M1A2 Abrams tank, pointing out that the model lacks one of the wheels that should be present. By emphasizing that this \\"pretty obvious detail\\" has been missed, the reviewer implies that the product is not an accurate representation and suggests that the maker failed to pay close attention to essential details. Furthermore, the reviewer notes that this detail \\"might be important for some,\\" which suggests that potential buyers who are looking for a highly accurate model or those with expert knowledge of the subject matter might find this omission of a wheel disappointing or even unacceptable. In this context, the review serves as a warning for those who prioritize accuracy in their purchases and may steer them away from choosing this particular product. The use of the word \\"unflattering\\" implies that the review is not only critical but also highlights a potential flaw in the product, which may impact its overall appeal and value. As such, the review certainly does not provide a positive view of the product and may discourage potential buyers. Of course, it should be considered that such a review represents just one perspective, and other customers may not find the missing wheel to be a significant or detrimental factor for their purchasing decision.

He takes up an audience with the boy, and begins to explain the tale regarding the Lorax.The land once thrived with truffula trees when the Once-ler first came to the area in a horse-drawn cart. Living among the foliage are the brown Bar-ba-Loots, who eat truffula fruit from the local trees. In the nearby pond live the Humming Fish, and overhead fly the Swomee Swans. The trees amaze the Once-ler with their texture and scent, and he soon builds a small shop in the area. After cutting down a truffula tree, the Lorax pops out of it's stump. The Lorax claims to speak for the trees, and demands to know what the Once-ler is doing.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sydney wanted to stop for lunch even though they had eaten only two hours earlier. Given the context: How would you describe Sydney? The answer is:","completion":"Based on the provided context, Sydney seems to possess a number of notable characteristics. Firstly, Sydney indicates a strong interest in food. Stopping for lunch just two hours after eating suggests a healthy - or perhaps even voracious - appetite. This is a person who evidently enjoys the culinary delights life has to offer. Sydney might have a particular love for food, or view eating as a primary source of pleasure or comfort. This could also be an indication that Sydney savors not just the food itself, but also the overall dining experience. Breaking bread, after all, usually means a chance to converse, socialize, and even indulge. However, it's also possible that Sydney could be suffering from physical issues causing increased hunger, like hypoglycemia or diabetes, or mental health issues such as anxiety or stress. By frequently eating, these individuals may be trying to maintain a steady blood sugar level, self-soothe, or cope with overwhelming feelings. A person with health-conscious tendencies could similarly find reassurance in eating regular, smaller meals. This strategy can help keep metabolism steady and maintain energy levels throughout the day. Secondly, depending on the expectations and the norms of Sydney's society or cultural background, this pattern of eating might suggest Sydney is nonconformist or unconcerned about societal norms. Traditional meal times might not matter to her as much as they do to others. This could indicate a sense of independence, a disregard for what's typical, or potentially even an impulsive or whimsical nature. Thirdly, this scenario might show that Sydney has a casual, even cavalier attitude toward the passage of time. Sydney's sense of time might be focused more on personal needs or desires than external standards or schedules. This time perception might be reflective of a larger mindset - one which prioritizes personal satisfaction over rigid schedule adherence. Lastly, Sydney may also represent an individual who simply enjoys the finer things in life – good food, relaxing times, and engaging conversation – someone who understands the importance of slowing down from the hustle and bustle of the daily grind and taking pleasure in simple, immediate comforts. Of course, this is speculative given the limited context - a complete depiction of Sydney would require additional information. Yet, these observations offer a starting point to understanding Sydney's unique behavioral and personality traits based on her desire to stop for lunch shortly after eating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The anthem was first performed on October 17 , 1870 , after which Prince Nikola declared it as the state anthem . In 1993 , the anthem was one of the proposals during the unsuccessful negotiations to adopt an Anthem of the Republic of Montenegro . The main problem was its monarchist lyrics . - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The Kingdom of Serbia, often rendered as \\"Servia\\" in English sources during the time of its existence, was created when Prince Milan I of Serbia, ruler of the Principality of Serbia, was crowned king in 1882. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities. - The Great National Assembly of the Serb People in Montenegro, known as the Podgorica Assembly ( /Podgorika skupština), was an assembly of the representative body of the Montenegrin people (the Kingdom of Montenegro) in November 1918, after World War I, that was to decide whether Montenegro was to unite with the Kingdom of Serbia. It was organized by a Serbian government committee. The two sides were known as the \\"Greens\\" and the \\"Whites\\", in favour of a confederation (independence) and unification (annexation), respectively. The assembly concluded the decision to merge Montenegro with Serbia. The creation of Yugoslavia followed. - The Kingdom of Montenegro (Serbian: a a / \\"Kraljevina Crna Gora\\"), was a monarchy in southeastern Europe, present day Montenegro, during the tumultuous years on the Balkan Peninsula leading up to and during World War I. Legally it was a constitutional monarchy, but absolutist in practice. On 28 November 1918, following the end of World War I, with its government still in exile, the unconstitutional Podgorica Assembly proclaimed union with the Kingdom of Serbia, and was merged into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes three days later, on 1 December 1918. - Anglican church music is music that is written for liturgical worship in Anglican church services.

The couple's taciturn grounds man Peter (Al Cliver) is happy enough looking after the slavering pack of dogs the couple own. But the maid Maria (Carla Cassola) is becoming more and more suspicious of her sinister employers that they are hiding something. Sure enough, she discovers the dead bodies of a money-grabbing nephew (Paolo Bernardi) and his wife (Francesco De Rose) lying preserved in open coffins in the wine cellar. Maria is gorily killed by the elderly Sarah in the greenhouse the next morning while announcing her plans to quit.Meanwhile, three hoodlums, Diana (Karina Huff), Tony (Keith Van Hoven) and Paul (Peter Hintz) are driving through the area and decide to rob the old couple's house after receiving a tip-off from a grocery store owner in a nearby town about the wealth it supposedly contains and the decrepitude of the owners. That evening, Diana cunningly talks her way into the household by pretending that her car has broken down nearby and asks to use the phone. Soon, the phone lines are cut by her male accomplices and they force entry through an open window. Their plans to rob the old couple go badly wrong when Peter intervenes with his shotgun. A bloodbath ensues with Sarah accidentally getting shot, Peter getting killed by Paul, and Victor attacks Tony, forcing Diana to shoot him dead. The young trio are horrified by this turn of events, but decide to bundle the bodies away in a cupboard.At first the dazed criminals fail to notice what effect the mayhem has had on all the clocks in the house. Each clock stops at 8:00 PM, the exact time the couple were killed. When they do notice, they try to leave, but are trapped indoors by the Dobermans let loose to prowl the grounds.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An abandoned ship crashes into a dockyard in Brooklyn, New York, and the ship inspector, Silas Green, finds it full of corpses. Elsewhere, Julius Jones, Silas's nephew, has a run-in with some Italian mobsters. Just as the two goons are about to kill Julius, Maximillian, a suave, mysterious vampire (who arrived on the ship in his intricately carved coffin), intervenes and kills them. Soon after, Maximillian infects Julius with his vampiric blood, before Julius turning into a decaying ghoul and claiming that it has benefits; he then explains that he has come to Brooklyn in search of the Dhampir daughter of a vampire from his native Caribbean island in order to live beyond the night of the next full moon. This Dhampir turns out to be NYPD Detective Rita Veder, who is still dealing with the death of her mentally ill mother (a paranormal researcher) some months before. As she and her partner, Detective Justice, are in the middle of investigating the murders on the ship, Rita begins having strange visions about a woman who looks like her, and begins asking questions about her mother's past. When she tells Justice about having \\"a strange feeling\\" about the investigation, he is skeptical, which frustrates Rita. The visions are presumably influenced in part by her vampire heritage; this is hinted at a few times throughout the first two-thirds of the story. Rita is completely unaware of this heritage, and believes she is losing her mind, similar to what happened to her mother. Meanwhile, Maximillian initiates a series of sinister methods to find out more about Rita and to further pull her into his thrall, including seducing and murdering her roommate Nikki, as well as disguising himself as her preacher and a lowlife crook.

China's hundreds of millions of web users increasingly use microblogs to criticise the state or vent anger. Recent research suggested Chinese censors actively target social media. The report by the Beijing News said that these monitors were not required to delete postings. By Dong LeBBC Chinese Service China's internet is one of the most controlled and censored in the world. Websites deemed to be subversive are blocked. Politically sensitive postings are routinely deleted . Even the name of the former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao was censored when rumours were circulating on the internet that his family had amassed a fortune while he was in power. But with the rapid growth of internet users, the ruling Communist Party has found itself fighting an uphill battle. The Beijing News, while reporting the story of microblog monitors, has admitted that it is impossible for the government to delete all \\"undesirable\\" postings. The more postings deleted, the more they appear, it says. China seldom reveals details about how it monitors and controls the internet. The government even does not acknowledge that it blocks web sites. But the report does offer a rare glimpse into this opaque world. They are \\"strictly to gather and analyse public opinions on microblog sites and compile reports for decision-makers\\", it said. It also added details about how some of these monitors work. Tang Xiaotao has been working as a monitor for less than six months, the report says, without revealing where he works. \\"He sits in front of a PC every day, and opening up an application, he types in key words which are specified by clients. \\"He then monitors negative opinions related to the clients, and gathers (them) and compile reports and send them to the clients,\\" it says. The reports says the software used in the office is even more advanced and supported by thousands of servers. It also monitors websites outside China. China rarely reveals any details concerning the scale and sophistication of its internet police force. It is believed that the two million internet monitors are part of a huge army which the government relies on to control the internet. The government is also to organise training classes for them for the first time from 14 to 18 October, the paper says. But it is not clear whether the training will be for existing monitors or for new recruits. The training will have eight modules, and teach participants how to analyse and judge online postings and deal with crisis situations, it says. The most popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, launched in 2010, now has more than 500 million registered users with 100 million messages posted daily. Topics cover a wide range - from personal hobbies, health to celebrity gossip and food safety but they talso include politically sensitive issues like official corruption. Postings deemed to be politically incorrect are routinely deleted. Summary:","completion":"In China, there are people called internet opinion analysts who work for the government and businesses. Their job is to look at what people are saying on the internet, especially on social media like microblogs. They watch for any negative opinions about their clients and report them. There are many rules on the internet in China because the government wants to control what people can see and talk about. Sometimes, they delete things they don't like. But, there are so many internet users in China, it is difficult for the government to delete everything.

Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

Google blamed an error by the financial printer that handles its quarterly earnings for an early release of the report that fell short of Wall Street expectations and slammed Google shares Thursday. In a statement Google said its printer RR Donnelly had released a draft of the Internet giant's third quarter financial results without authorization and well before the scheduled release time after the market close. \\"Earlier this morning RR Donnelley, the financial printer, informed us that they had filed our draft 8K earnings statement without authorization. We have ceased trading on NASDAQ while we work to finalize the document. Once it's finalized we will release our earnings, resume trading on NASDAQ and hold our earnings call as normal at 1:30 PM PT,\\" the company said. Shares of Google, the world's No.1 Internet search engine, declined 9 percent to 687.30, a loss of about 19 billion in market capitalization, before trading was halted by Nasdaq. After they resumed trading at 3:20 p.m. ET, they were down about 8.9 percent. Donnelly said it is conducting an investigation to discover how the error happened. Shares of Donnelly dropped too. Reuters reported that the second page of the mistakenly-released report seemed to have a space reserved for a quote from CEO Larry Page: \\"Pending Larry quote.\\" \\"We had a strong quarter,\\" Page said in a statement on the company's website when the earnings were finally released.

Excluding certain items, it earned 9.03 a share, down from 9.72 in the third quarter last year and vastly underperforming the 10.65 analysts had expected, on average. Revenue rose to 11.33 billion, minus traffic acquisition costs, but also missed expectations. The miss was a sign of one of Wall Street's major worries this earnings season: revenues are coming in lower than many had expected. But company top lines—or the revenue generated that should be driving those bottom-line profit beats—have been even worse this quarter than they were last. With about one-third of the companies on the Standard & Poor's 500 reporting so far, a healthy 65 percent have beaten the low bar set for profit expectations in the third quarter. But while that has been happening, just 42 percent have topped revenue forecasts. That is well below the historical average of 62 percent and even worse than the anemic second quarter, which saw a sales beat of just 44 percent. The market has flatlined so far during earnings. Investors have shown a tendency as the economy works its way back from the financial crisis and ensuing recession that ended in 2009 to reward companies growing revenue and penalize those who fall short even if they beat on profit.

What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are as follows: 1. Google's earnings were released earlier than expected due to an error by financial printer RR Donnelley. The draft 8K earnings statement was filed without authorization, causing confusion and impacting Google's stock. 2. Google's Q3 earnings per share (EPS) were reported at 9.03, lower than the estimated 10.65. Additionally, cost per click was down, concerning investors. 3. When trading was halted on NASDAQ, Google's shares dropped 9% to 687.30, resulting in a loss of around 19 billion in market capitalization. 4. Google has been facing challenges with turning around the money-losing cell phone maker Motorola Mobility, which it acquired for 12.5 billion. 5. Google reported a 20% decrease in net income to 2.18 billion, and its revenue of 11.33 billion (minus traffic acquisition costs) also missed expectations. 6. The early release and disappointing earnings highlight a growing concern on Wall Street about companies' revenues coming in lower than expected during the earnings season."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Context: The value of the U.S. dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold, and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the value of the U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve, however, continued to increase the money supply, resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar in the 1970s. This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked (the Phillips curve), and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign. Between 1965 and 1981, the U.S. dollar lost two thirds of its value.

This situation was further exacerbated by the widespread belief in the Phillips curve, which suggested that inflation and real economic growth were linked, causing inflation to be seen as relatively benign.

Article: Adam Schefter reports that Colin Kaepernick's visit and tryout with Seattle has been postponed due to questions regarding the national anthem. (1:26) After arranging for Colin Kaepernick to work out for the Seattle Seahawks this week, team officials postponed the trip when the quarterback declined to say he would stop kneeling during the national anthem next season, a league source told ESPN on Thursday. Seattle still is considering bringing in Kaepernick for a tryout, and no decisions are final, a source said. Editor's Picks Colin Kaepernick's rise from quarterback to social; activist: a timeline The former 49ers quarterback started a movement when he took a knee, and the rest was history. The Seahawks on Friday signed former Washington Redskins quarterback Stephen Morris, according to a league source. Seattle had contacted Kaepernick about two weeks ago to arrange a visit to the team's headquarters, but after tentative arrangements were made and travel was planned, the trip was unexpectedly scuttled over the Seahawks' last-minute stipulation regarding Kaepernick's anthem stance, a source told ESPN. The source said the Seahawks wanted to know that Kaepernick wouldn't kneel this season, and he was unwilling to give that assurance to them. The day after his scheduled workout with the Seahawks, Kaepernick sat for his deposition administered by NFL attorneys in New York regarding the league's alleged attempts to conspire to keep him out of the league. This comes at a time in which the Cincinnati Bengals visited with San Francisco 49ers free-agent safety Eric Reid, who knelt with Kaepernick during the anthem, and wanted assurances from Reid that he would not participate in on-field activism. No NFL team has worked out Kaepernick, who once helped lead the 49ers to the Super Bowl, since he became a free agent after the 2016 season. The Seahawks visited with him a year ago and considered it again this week, and the Baltimore Ravens entertained the idea of bringing in Kaepernick last summer. The Seahawks are still working through their backup quarterback situation and have not decided whom they want to bring in to work behind Russell Wilson. Kaepernick is expected to be one of the options, but other quarterbacks will be considered. ||||| The Seahawks may still consider bringing in Kaepernick for a visit as the team explores options at backup quarterback but needs assurances that he is committed to football. The Seahawks were ready to bring in former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for a workout Monday as they search for a backup to Russell Wilson but postponed the meeting when he said he did not know what his plan is for his off-field social activism going forward, including whether he would continue to kneel for the national anthem. The news was first reported Thursday by ESPN’s Adam Schefter and later confirmed by the Times. A source told the Times that the Seahawks asked Kaepernick what his plans would be for his off-field activities if he were to play football in 2018 and that Kaepernick — who kneeled for the anthem during his most recent season in the NFL with the 49ers in 2016 — said he didn’t know. The Seahawks were said to want a firmer plan from Kaepernick about all of his off-field activities — including but not solely limited to kneeling for the anthem — and how that might impact football. The Seahawks reportedly made the request of Kaepernick late last week after initially setting up the visit with Kaepernick roughly two weeks ago. [ Stone | Kaepernick still the best option for the Seahawks » ] With Kaepernick saying he was unclear of his future off-field plans, the Seahawks then decided to postpone the trip for now so that coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider could further discuss the situation, but left the door open that Kaepernick could still be considered and brought in for a visit. However, several national reports — including ESPN and Pro Football Talk — stated that the workout was postponed solely because Kaepernick said he would not commit to standing for the anthem. That led to a perception that Kaepernick’s side was offering one version of what happened — that the visit was postponed solely because he would not commit to not kneeling for the anthem — while the team was offering a version that kneeling for the anthem was only one aspect of the equation. Regardless, what is clear is that the Seahawks had a definite plan to talk to Kaepernick about being the team’s backup and that now it’s unclear if any further conversion will happen. ESPN reported that the Seahawks “contacted Kaepernick about two weeks ago to arrange a visit to the team’s headquarters, but after tentative arrangements were made and travel planned, the trip was unexpectedly scuttled over the Seahawks’ last-minute stipulation regarding Kaepernick’s anthem stance.” ESPN reported the Seahawks made arrangements for the visit with Kaepernick the day before Kapernick sat for his deposition administered by NFL attorneys in New York regarding the league’s alleged attempts to conspire to keep him out of the league. Seahawks owner Paul Allen is among those who is still scheduled to be deposed in the hearings, according to Yahoo.com. Regardless of what happens with Kaepernick, the Seahwks will are expected to continue to pursue other options at backup quarterback, as well — Seattle has only Wilson on its roster at quarterback after releasing Trevone Boykin last month after he was arrested in Texas on suspicion of domestic violence. Seattle also brought in Kaepernick for a visit last May after which Carroll said the team did not sign him due in part because “he’s a starter in this league and I can’t imagine — we have a starter. But he’s a starter in this league and I can’t imagine somebody won’t give him a chance to play.’’ Seattle eventually signed Austin Davis as its backup in 2017. Davis, who played just just snaps last season, remains a free agent. Under Carroll, the Seahawks have been regarded as being as supportive of players’ social stances and on- and off-field activities as any team in the NFL. Carroll publicly supported the decision of Michael Bennett to sit for the anthem last season (with Bennett often joined by most of the rest of the defensive line). Carroll also supported the team’s decision to stay in the locker room for the anthem before a game at Tennessee when the players wanted to make a statement following tweets and statements from President Donald Trump criticizing players who did not stand for the anthem. But Carroll also said at the end of last season that he thought some of the off-field activities took a toll on the team’s performance on the field, especially the 33-27 loss at Tennessee following a day of meetings to discuss what the team should do in reaction to Trump’s comments, and seemed to hint that he hoped the team would be more focused on football in 2018. Since then, the team has traded Bennett to Philadelphia. “You know, I think it had an effect in the game that week in Tennessee, yeah I really do think it had an effect,” Carroll said in his season-ending press conference on Jan. 2. “I think it had an effect on a lot of teams and a lot of players. It was an extraordinarily heated time. I think that was a different amount of emotional output that occurred before the game. It looked like it the way we played; it looked like it took its toll, and we had gone through the whole process in doing what we did. We needed to do it, and we couldn’t avoid it. We had to face it and we had to deal with it, and the other team called us up and said ‘What are you guys going to do,’ and they said ‘Ok, we’ll do that, too.’ I don’t know if they went through the same process that we went through or not, I don’t know, but I know we did. Honestly, if I could’ve done something about it I would’ve. I don’t think that there was anything but needing to face it; it’s too real. “I did find out during the course of the year that guys didn’t want to stay on the topic. It was too draining and it was too deep and I hope in the off-season, guys can come back around to find what they want to work at and learn and grow with, but it was draining. It’s a real-life discussion that we’re talking about here when we’re talking about inequality and justice and stuff like that. There’s real-life stuff here that needs to be talked about and needs to continue to be connected with, but in the course of a football season and all of those factors that contributed to keeping that alive, some came from across the country, and some came right internally from the locker room, and it was all over the place. It was taxing; and I think it is something to not be forgotten about this football season. I think it was part of it.” Kaepernick did not play in 2017 after spending the 2011-16 seasons on the roster of the 49ers. He led San Francisco to the Super Bowl following the 2012 season and then to the NFC title game following the 2013 season when the Seahawks beat San Francisco 23-17 at CenturyLink Field when Richard Sherman tipped a Kaepernick pass into the hands of Malcolm Smith for a game-clinching interception in the final seconds. The visit with Seattle last May is the only reported visit Kaepernick has had with an NFL team since he opted out of his contract in March, 2017, a move he made knowing the team was going to release him, which allowed him to hit free agency earlier. The 30-year-old is 28-30 in his career as a starter.

Here the omnibus came up, and I rode back to Manchester. The whole conversation took up very little more time than it will take to read it; but I thought it worth recording, as characteristic of the people now suffering in Lancashire from no fault of their own. I know the people well. The greatest number of them would starve themselves to that degree that they would not be of much more physical use in this world, before they would condescend to beg. But starving to death is hard work. What will winter bring to them when severe weather begins to tell upon constitutions lowered in tone by a starvation diet--a diet so different to what they have been used to when in work? What will the 1s. 6d. a-head weekly do for them in that hard time? If something more than this is not done for them, when more food, clothing, and fire are necessary to everybody, calamities may arise which will cost England a hundred times more than a sufficient relief--a relief worthy of those who are suffering, and of the nation they belong to--would have cost. In the meantime the cold wings of winter already begin to overshadow the land; and every day lost involves the lives, or the future usefulness, of thousands of our best population. After reading the above, is \\"A great number would starve themselves before they would beg for handouts and help\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What was discovered about the nature of the Lancashire people from the conversations on the bus ride back to Manchester?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"A great number would starve themselves before they would beg for handouts and help\\" accurately summarizes the information about the nature of the Lancashire people discovered during the conversations on the bus ride back to Manchester. The passage highlights their strong character and pride in not wanting to beg despite suffering from the effects of starvation due to circumstances beyond their control."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this instance: Context: Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors exhibit strong phenotypic differences that can be quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the underlying biological drivers of these imaging phenotypes remain largely unknown. An Imaging-Genomics analysis was performed to reveal the mechanistic associations between MRI derived quantitative volumetric tumor phenotype features and molecular pathways.', 'One hundred fourty one patients with presurgery MRI and survival data were included in our analysis. Volumetric features were defined, including the necrotic core (NE), contrast-enhancement (CE), abnormal tumor volume assessed by post-contrast T1w (tumor bulk or TB), tumor-associated edema based on T2-FLAIR (ED), and total tumor volume (TV), as well as ratios of these tumor components. Based on gene expression where available (nu2009=u200991), pathway associations were assessed using a preranked gene set enrichment analysis. These results were put into context of molecular subtypes in GBM and prognostication.', 'Volumetric features were significantly associated with diverse sets of biological processes (FDRu2009<u20090.05). While NE and TB were enriched for immune response pathways and apoptosis, CE was associated with signal transduction and protein folding processes. ED was mainly enriched for homeostasis and cell cycling pathways. ED was also the strongest predictor of molecular GBM subtypes (AUCu2009=u20090.61). CE was the strongest predictor of overall survival (C-indexu2009=u20090.6; Noether test, pu2009=u20094x10(-4)).Question: Does imaging-genomics reveal driving pathways of MRI derived volumetric tumor phenotype features in Glioblastoma? Student:","completion":"Yes, imaging-genomics analysis does reveal driving pathways of MRI derived volumetric tumor phenotype features in Glioblastoma (GBM). The analysis showed that different volumetric features were significantly associated with diverse sets of biological processes (FDR < 0.05). For instance, necrotic core (NE) and tumor bulk (TB) were enriched for immune response pathways and apoptosis, while contrast-enhancement (CE) was associated with signal transduction and protein folding processes. Moreover, tumor-associated edema (ED) was mainly enriched for homeostasis and cell cycling pathways. These findings demonstrate the potential of imaging-genomics for uncovering the underlying biological drivers of MRI-derived phenotypes in Glioblastoma."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rice's recollection was that the idea had come from Clarke and the NSC senior director for intelligence, Mary McCarthy, and had been linked to the proposal for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks. Rice described the draft document as providing for \\"consolidation plus,\\" superseding the various Clinton administration documents. In fact, the CIA drafted two documents. One was a finding that did concern aid to opponents of the Taliban regime; the other was a draft Memorandum of Notification, which included more open-ended language authorizing possible lethal action in a variety of situations. Tenet delivered both to Hadley on March 28. The CIA's notes for Tenet advised him that \\"in response to the NSC request for drafts that will help the policymakers review their options, each of the documents has been crafted to provide the Agency with the broadest possible discretion permissible under the law.\\" At the meeting, Tenet argued for deciding on a policy before deciding on the legal authorities to implement it. Hadley accepted this argument, and the draft MON was put on hold. As the policy review moved forward, the planned covert action program for Afghanistan was included in the draft presidential directive, as part of an \\"Annex A\\" on intelligence activities to \\"eliminate the al Qaeda threat.\\" The main debate during the summer of 2001 concentrated on the one new mechanism for a lethal attack on Bin Laden-an armed version of the Predator drone. In the first months of the new administration, questions concerning the Predator became more and more a central focus of dispute. Clarke favored resuming Predator flights over Afghanistan as soon as weather permitted, hoping that they still might provide the elusive \\"actionable intelligence\\" to target Bin Laden with cruise missiles. Learning that the Air Force was thinking of equipping Predators with warheads, Clarke became even more enthusiastic about redeployment. The CTC chief, Cofer Black, argued against deploying the Predator for reconnaissance purposes. He recalled that theTaliban had spotted a Predator in the fall of 2000 and scrambled their MiG fighters. Black wanted to wait until the armed version was ready. \\"I do not believe the possible recon value outweighs the risk of possible program termination when the stakes are raised by the Taliban parading a charred Predator in front of CNN,\\" he wrote. Question: \\"In the debate over the use of armed Predator drones what position did Clarke favor?\\" Response: \\"He wanted to end all use of Predator drones\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. Clarke favored resuming Predator flights over Afghanistan as soon as weather permitted, with the hope of obtaining actionable intelligence to target Bin Laden with cruise missiles. He also became more enthusiastic about the deployment of armed Predators when he learned that the Air Force was considering equipping them with warheads."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released in July 1971 in the United States by Capricorn Records. As the title indicates, the recording took place at the New York City music venue Fillmore East, which was run by concert promoter Bill Graham. It was recorded over the course of three nights in March 1971 and features the band performing extended jam versions of songs such as \\"Whipping Post\\", \\" At Fillmore East was recorded over two nights -- March 12 and 13, 1971 -- for which the band was paid 1250 each show. The shows were typical performances for the band, and regarded as slightly above average by drummer Jai Johanny Johanson. Ads for the shows read: \\"Bill Graham Presents in New York -- Johnny Winter And, Elvin Bishop Group, Extra Added Attraction: Allman Brothers.\\" While Winter was billed as headliner, by the third night the Allman Brothers were closing the show. Tom Dowd produced At Fillmore East; he had previously worked on their second studio album, Idlewild South. He had recently returned from Africa from working on the film Soul to Soul, and stayed in New York several days to oversee the live recording. \\"It was a good truck, with a 16-track machine and a great, tough-as-nails staff who took care of business,\\" recalled Dowd. He gave the staff suggestions and noted the band had two lead guitarists and two drummers, \\"which was unusual, and it took some foresight to properly capture the dynamics.\\" Things went smoothly until the band unexpectedly brought out saxophonist Rudolph \\"Juicy\\" Carter, an unknown horn player, and longstanding \\"unofficial\\" band member Thom Doucette on harmonica. \\"I was just hoping we could isolate them, so we could wipe them and use the songs, but they started playing and the horns were leaking all over everything, rendering the songs unusable,\\" said Dowd. He rushed to Duane during the break to tell him to cut the horn players; while Duane loved the players, he put up no fight with Dowd. The final show was delayed because of a bomb scare, and did not end until 6 am. Each night following the shows, the musicians and Dowd would \\"grab some beers and sandwiches\\" and head to Manhattan's Atlantic Studios to go over the performances. Set lists for following shows were crafted by listening to the recordings and going over what they could keep and what they would need to capture once more. \\"We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to do it because we didn't want to go back and overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album,\\" said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit. \\"That was our pinnacle,\\" said Dickey Betts later. \\"The Fillmore days are definitely the most cherished memories that I have. If you asked everybody in the band, they would probably say that.\\" On June 27, the Fillmore East closed, and the band were invited to play a final, invitation-only concert, along with Edgar Winter, the Beach Boys and Country Joe McDonald. The Beach Boys initially refused to perform unless they headlined the event, but Graham refused, telling them that the Allman Brothers would be closing the show, and they were free to leave if they disagreed. The Allman Brothers' performance was used for additional tracks when an expanded version of At Fillmore East, The Fillmore Concerts, was reissued on CD.

Although it mentions Betty Ford's role in raising breast cancer awareness and her support for the Equal Rights Amendment, it does not give any information about her husband. To answer your original question, Betty Ford's husband was Gerald Ford, the 38th President of the United States who served from 1974 to 1977. Gerald Ford, born Leslie Lynch King Jr., later adopted the name of his stepfather, Gerald Rudolff Ford. He was previously the Vice President under Richard Nixon but assumed the presidency after Nixon's resignation in 1974 amidst the Watergate scandal. Gerald Ford was an influential figure in American politics during his tenure, despite facing various challenges, including the winding down of the Vietnam War, economic recession, and a domestic energy crisis. He is also known for his decision to pardon Nixon, which was a controversial move, but one that he felt was necessary to help the nation move on from the turmoil surrounding the Watergate scandal. Betty Ford was known for her roles in advancing women's rights and social issues. As a First Lady, she openly discussed her fight with breast cancer, substance abuse, and advocated for equal rights for women, which contributed to her lasting legacy as an influential and progressive public figure. The couple had four children together: Michael, John, Steven, and Susan, and their marriage lasted until Gerald Ford passed away in 2006. Overall, it's essential to differentiate between the achievements and legacy of Betty Ford, and the original question, which was seeking information about her husband."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"The perpetual ding-dong of French politics went from ding to dong on Sunday.\\"","completion":"Title: The Perpetual Ding-Dong of French Politics: A Closer Look at its Unending Cycle Introduction \\"The perpetual ding-dong of French politics went from ding to dong on Sunday.\\" This statement, albeit an unusual catchphrase, could not be more telling of recent events unfolding in French politics. Yet, it is also emblematic of the persistent tussle between opposing forces within the political framework of the country. This article delves into the core elements of this unending cycle in French politics and analyzes the reasons behind the perpetual ding-dong. (Step 1: Introduce the topic and create interest in the reader.) The Unending Cycle: French Politics in Context Historically, French politics has witnessed an endless dance of power between its several factions. Much of this can be attributed to entrenched ideological differences stretching across the left-right political spectrum. However, one cannot overlook the equally significant role played by the electoral system, political parties, and the ensuing tectonic shifts in power dynamics. (Step 2: Set the context for the topic - French politics.) Ding to Dong: Reflecting on Recent Events The phrase \\"from ding to dong\\" aptly describes the oscillating balance of power that has characterized French politics for years. It serves as a timely reminder of the unexpected outcomes of recent political events such as the emergence of President Emmanuel Macron's centrist La République en Marche! party and the waning influence of traditional parties represented by Les Républicains and the Parti Socialiste. In this regard, \\"on Sunday\\" alludes to the rapidly changing political landscape in France, which has witnessed unforeseen events such as the rise of the far-right Front National, now known as Rassemblement National, and the formation of a coalition between various left-leaning political factions in response. (Step 3: Provide an overview of recent French political events and alignments.) Factors Contributing to Perpetual Ding-Dong Several reasons could be attributed to this dynamic in French politics: 1. The system of proportional representation. By providing a platform for numerous political parties catering to different segments of the populace, it's essential for parties to negotiate and form strategic political alliances. 2. The existence of diverse interest groups with distinct policy preferences. This diversity often leads to the necessity for political parties to realign their positions in an attempt to reach a consensus or to garnish more extensive public support. 3. The interplay of regional and national perspectives. Local considerations often require politicians to align themselves with specific interests or political factions, adding to the complexity of French politics. (Step 4: Identify and succinctly explain the contributing factors for perpetual ding-dong.) The Role of French Citizens Amidst the Political Back-and-Forth As politics in France continue to oscillate, citizens remain spectators to a spectacle fueled by ideological diversity, realignment, and shifting political alliances. While some may argue that this perpetual change signifies an active, fluid democracy, others contend that it limits consensus-building. In either case, the French political landscape remains both engaging and perplexing, providing plenty of fodder for journalists to cover the ding-dong of it all. (Step 5: Discuss the impact of the perpetual ding-dong on French citizens and acknowledge differing opinions.) Conclusion In conclusion, the perpetual ding-dong of French politics is a phenomenon deeply rooted in the nation's political, social, and cultural landscape. As the ding turns to dong and back again, one can only wait in anticipation to see how this relentless game of political musical chairs will impact the governed and the governance in the beautiful land of liberte, egalite, and fraternite.

In 1920, the League of Nations mandated the country to South Africa, which imposed its laws and, from 1948, its apartheid policy. The port of Walvis Bay and the offshore Penguin Islands had been annexed by the Cape Colony under the British crown by 1878 and had become an integral part of the new Union of South Africa at its creation in 1910.

Q: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

How will the ban on Rs 500 and 1000 notes impact the Indian economy? Now that Modi govt has decided to stop circulation of Rs.500 & 1000 notes, how will this impact the Indian economy? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Yes, both questions essentially ask about the effects of the ban on Rs 500 and 1000 notes on the Indian economy. Here is an in-depth analysis of the impact this decision made by the Indian government: The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, announced on November 8, 2016, that it would demonetize the existing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes in an effort to counter black money, corruption, and counterfeiting. This move meant that the high denomination currency notes ceased to be legal tender and were replaced by new Rs. 500 and Rs. 2000 notes. The impact of this decision on the Indian economy was multifaceted, and here are some of the key areas where the consequences were most felt: 1. Black money and corruption: One of the main objectives of the demonetization move was to curb the flow of black money in the Indian economy. The sudden announcement rendered a large chunk of unaccounted wealth held in cash useless, forcing people to deposit their money in banks to avoid losses. In turn, this led to an increase in the tax base, as many individuals were compelled to declare their previously hidden income. However, critics argue that a significant portion of black money is not held in cash but rather invested in other assets, such as real estate or gold. 2. Counterfeiting: The demonetization exercise was also aimed at combating counterfeit currency, particularly those used to finance terrorist activities. By withdrawing the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, the government made it more difficult for criminals to use fake currency in the economy and gave law enforcement agencies a window of opportunity to crack down on counterfeiting networks. 3. Cashless economy: One of the indirect effects of demonetization was an increased push for digital payments and a shift towards a cashless economy. Due to the cash crunch experienced in the aftermath of demonetization, many individuals and businesses turned to digital modes of payment. This transition was supported by the fast-growing digital infrastructure and the government's efforts to promote cashless transactions. 4. Economic slowdown: The abrupt withdrawal of a significant portion of the currency in circulation led to an initial cash crunch, which in turn affected consumer spending and disrupted the supply chain. This resulted in an economic slowdown, particularly in the informal sector, which relied heavily on cash transactions. The disruption was felt most acutely by small businesses, farmers, and daily wage laborers who struggled to access cash for their day-to-day needs, leading to job losses and reduced household income. 5. GDP growth: In the short term, the Indian economy experienced a decline in GDP growth due to the impact of demonetization on consumption and investment. According to the World Bank, India's GDP growth fell to 6.7% in 2017, down from 8.2% in 2015. However, it's important to note that there were other factors contributing to the slowdown, such as disruptions caused by the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). 6. Inflation: Demonetization caused a decrease in consumer spending, which led to a drop in the demand for goods and services. This, coupled with the reduced money supply, resulted in lower inflation in the months following the announcement. However, as the economy adjusted to the new currency notes, inflation gradually returned to earlier levels. In conclusion, the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes had both positive and negative effects on the Indian economy. While it contributed to tackling black money and corruption and encouraged the shift towards digital payments, it also caused an economic slowdown in the short term, with significant hardship for the vulnerable sections of society. Notwithstanding the mixed results, demonetization undeniably played a significant role in shaping India's financial landscape towards greater transparency and accountability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The blaze, which rapidly spread through the hotel leaving significant damage in its wake, has led to a full-scale investigation, as authorities work to determine the cause and identify any potential suspects. Step 1: Elaborate on the incident and its impact On the fateful evening, the flames quickly engulfed a considerable portion of the luxurious hotel, prompting an immediate evacuation of the property. Remarkably, no casualties were reported, thanks to the swift response of the hotel's staff and local firefighters. However, the extent of damage to the historic building and the potential consequences for the hotel's standing in the community remains to be assessed. Step 2: Detail the response of emergency services and hotel staff The emergency services received numerous calls concerning the fire, compelling them to promptly dispatch multiple fire brigades to the scene. Upon arrival, firefighters quickly leaped into action to battle the blaze and minimize damage to the architectural gem. Hotel staff, meanwhile, calmly facilitated the evacuation procedure, ensuring that all guests were safely escorted from the premises. Together, the teams remained on high alert and managed to prevent the situation from escalating further. Step 3: Discuss the investigation As the dust settled and with growing concerns in the community, the authorities immediately launched an investigation to determine the cause of the fire. Believing that the incident could potentially be the result of deliberate action, the investigators are currently examining all possibilities and leaving no stone unturned. Security footage, witness statements, and on-site examinations are among the key evidence being meticulously examined at this stage. Given the hotel's prestigious standing, finding answers remains crucial for the local authorities, the hotel's staff, and loyal patrons. Step 4: Explain the implications for the hotel and the community With the investigation ongoing and the hotel temporarily closed for repairs, the fire has undoubtedly sparked worries within the local community. The prestigious hotel, often considered a symbol of luxury and fine Scottish hospitality, serves as a popular venue for events and a significant source of revenue for the area. The destructive fire threatens not only the hotel’s image but also bears direct implications on the livelihoods of the hotel's staff and allied businesses. Step 5: Conclude the article In light of these distressing circumstances, the need to ascertain the origins of the fire, identify those responsible if any, and take necessary measures to prevent similar incidents in the future is paramount.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone. Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century. Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number. But I can use this background: Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. What is an answer for this question: Which century saw northeast Michigan's water table at decreased level, sixteenth century or twentieth century? Answer:","completion":"The twentieth century saw northeast Michigan's water table at a decreased level compared to the sixteenth century. This can be attributed to several factors that occurred during this time period, particularly the drastic changes in land use and management. In the sixteenth century, Michigan, especially its northeast part, was covered in forests dominated by elm and oak species. The presence of these forests helped maintain the water table at a relatively stable level by allowing water to be absorbed and stored in large amounts. Trees, with their extensive root systems, played a vital role in regulating the water table, by absorbing water from the ground and transpiring it into the atmosphere. This process of evapotranspiration contributed to maintaining a balanced water cycle. However, by the twentieth century, the landscape of northeast Michigan had significantly changed. Extensive logging operations led to the removal of large swaths of forests, which were replaced by farmlands to support an increasing human population. With the loss of these forests and the benefits they provided in managing water resources, the water table saw an overall decline. Additionally, the widespread use of irrigation systems in the twentieth century to support agriculture further contributed to the decreasing water table levels in northeast Michigan. Irrigation causes an increase in groundwater recharge, leading to a rise in the water table and mobilization of salts. Furthermore, the clearance of vegetation allowed saline water to come into contact with freshwater habitats and vegetation, leading to increased salinization and compromising the buffering properties of the groundwater system. The combination of deforestation, agricultural development, and an increased reliance on irrigation systems led to the observed decline in the water table during the twentieth century in northeast Michigan. This, in turn, made the region more susceptible to the negative effects of droughts and other climate-induced stressors on the remaining forests and ecosystems. The loss of forests and natural vegetation cover also led to reduced evapotranspiration, compounding the effects of lowered water table levels."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They say he would be bad for the economy, and they question how successful he's been as a businessman.

Some of his highest profile supporters include investor Carl Icahn, financier T. Boone Pickens and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. The anti-Trump letter makes a two-front case against the Republican nominee. They say he has not been particularly successful in his decades in real estate.

He’s hemorrhaging support from high-profile Republicans and swing-state voters. It seems clear at this point that Trump has lost the race. Clear, that is, to everyone but billionaire Facebook investor and Charles Foster Kane cosplayer Peter Thiel. According to the New York Times, Thiel is donating 1.25 million to the Republican effort “through a combination of super PAC donations and funds given directly to the campaign.” The question, obviously, is why? Thiel’s support for Trump was never a secret, but since his prime-time speaking spot at the Republican National Convention, the investor has kept silent. Reappearing at the last minute to donate a large sum of money to a campaign that is, by most accounts, already over — in the process reminding his mostly liberal business partners and associates of his devotion to a candidate they hate — is a curious thing to do, especially for someone who has such an outsize reputation as a savvy investor. As such, it’s been the subject of a great deal of gleeful speculation and wanton theorizing. Why would Peter Thiel donate 1.25 million to a loser? It’s a first-round investment in Trump TV: Thiel’s willingness to show some seven-figure support for Trump at this late stage might signal that Thiel wants to stay in Trump’s circle even after the polls close and the votes are tallied. Widespread speculation holds that Trump (possibly with the help of his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Roger Ailes) is looking into launching a cable channel following the election. Maybe Thiel is demonstrating interest in getting in on the ground floor of that? It’s an appealing theory, but there’s little concrete evidence that Trump is actually interested in parlaying his campaign into a media business. Plus, cable channels — especially those targeted at, and run by, elderly reactionaries — aren’t necessarily sure-thing investments, and Thiel has recently shown more interest in destroying media empires than creating them. He’s “paying” for his speaking spot at the RNC: Thiel made history over the summer when he stood onstage at the Republican National Convention and told the crowd that he was proud to be gay. He also said some vague stuff about … I think space? At the very least, the appearance introduced Thiel to a group of people that generally believe that Silicon Valley elite are uniformly against conservative values. On Twitter, Recode’s Peter Kafka wonders if the donation is “the bare minimum Thiel previously agreed to donate in return for his RNC speaking spot.” Maybe flushing 1.25 million down the toilet is his way of saying thanks. It’s an investment in the alt-right: Even if a Trump presidency never happens, his campaign has legitimized and bolstered the alt-right, the post-libertarian, anti-immigrant, “race-realist” movement with which Thiel would seem to share a great deal of common ideological ground. Thiel likes to think in historical terms, and is fond of long-game bets. Maybe this is his way of demonstrating a commitment to the alt-right wing of Trump’s supporter base — even a reward for Trump’s increasingly unhinged behavior over the last few weeks. Or, maybe more prosaically, support for a Republican now opens the door to more direct involvement in the future. Now-denied reports indicated that Thiel was in the running for a Trump Supreme Court nomination. But why stop at the bench? Trump’s shown that someone with money and a willingness to indulge Republican voters’ worst impulses can build a compelling campaign. He thinks Trump might actually win: I mean, why not? Crazier things have happened, and being one of the few people loudly and publicly supporting the candidate this late in the campaign surely translates to leverage and influence (if not an appointed position) in a Trump White House. Venture capitalists — Thiel in particular — tend to love long-shot bets with big payoffs, and it’s hard to think of a bet with a longer shot or a bigger payoff than this. He’s a contrarian troll with money to burn: 1.25 million is, to pretty much everyone who is not Peter Thiel, a lot of money. To Thiel, who is worth 2.7 billion, his donation amounts to 0.046 percent of his assets. It is, as Ralph Kramden once put it, a mere bag of shells. He spent eight times that amount to put Gawker out of business via Hulk Hogan. Thiel, who is reportedly interested in harvesting the blood of the young in order to stave off the creep of death, has no problem spending his vast reserves of cash on petty and foolish causes. ||||| OPEN LETTER FROM BUSINESS LEADERS SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP In this political season, our nation faces an economic choice between whether to fall back on the past or move forward toward our future. Our prosperity – and our children’s futures – are at stake. The big economic question on the minds of most Americans is whether our days of strong economic growth are over. Donald Trump says, “of course not.” The Trump economic plan is comprehensive and far-reaching. It cuts taxes, stops trade cheating, reduces regulations, unleashes America’s powerful energy sector and eliminates our growth-draining trade deficit. This potent combination of tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will accelerate our GDP growth rate, create millions of jobs, and trillions of dollars in new additional income and tax revenues. Hillary Clinton has thrown in the towel on the idea of strong economic growth. In what would be effectively a “third Obama term,” she will raise taxes, continue to increase the already oppressive regulatory burden on both consumers and businesses, stifle efforts to make our nation energy independent and negotiate more bad trade deals that ship our jobs and factories offshore. What Obama and Clinton see as a path to economic growth is simply a dead end. We have had the weakest economic recovery since World War II and the GDP growth rate is well below our historic norm. Clinton’s policies promise to accelerate this decline. Business leaders are particularly worried about America’s anemic growth prospects, making them cautious about investing and hiring. The erratic policies of the past eight years have created troubling uncertainty. Will threatened tax hikes happen? How onerous will the many new regulations be? What’s next in the messy complexity of Obamacare, which is unraveling for millions of Americans before our eyes? It clearly is, as even Bill Clinton has put it, “the craziest thing.” Donald Trump is a businessman. He knows if we want to have more economic growth, real wage growth, and higher living standards, we need to focus on basic building blocks, not more Keynesian stimulus and financial engineering. Basic building blocks mean making America the best place to invest, helping American workers become more productive, and restoring America to its rightful place as the land of opportunity. As business leaders and entrepreneurs, we believe our nation needs a President who understands free markets because he’s lived and worked in them. We need a President who understands how government can hobble innovation, destroy opportunity and restrain growth. We need a President who knows how economic freedom can lift people out of poverty, open paths to and grow the middle class while offering everyone the opportunity to earn their success.

This playground is called Princeton University and it has a big storehouse. In that storehouse, like a big treasure chest, there's lots of stuff - notes, photos, reports, old tests, all sorts of things - and they all help us understand what has happened on the playground for many years and years. And another thing, you know Donald Trump right? He's like a big, loud kid who wants to be the leader of the biggest playground of them all - the United States. But some people, including business leaders, who are like the adults running the restaurants and shops around the playground, don't want him to be the leader. They think he might not be good for the playground's economy, which is like the way toys and sweets are shared and traded in the playground. Among these people, there are some pretty important individuals like the person who started a big, online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, where you can learn about almost anything, and even a famous chef. They wrote a letter saying they think Trump is too unpredictable to be the leader. And then, there's another man named Peter Thiel, he's like a rich kid who is giving a lot of his pocket money to Trump because he thinks he should be the playground leader. Some people are confused about this because they don't think Trump has a chance of becoming the leader. They speculate about his reasons, but we can't be sure why he is doing it. And lastly, there is another group of playground shopkeepers, restaurant and company owners who think Trump could be a good leader. They believe Trump’s plan for running the playground - cutting certain trades, lowering fees, and introducing new rules - will make the playground a better place. So, just like in your playground, there are different opinions on who should be the leader, and they are trying to convince others to support their candidate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tama Answer:","completion":"Title: Tama's Call Our story is set in a distant, unique fantasy world known as Draverna. In this magical world, mythological beasts, powerful magicians, and extraordinary beings reside. Tama, our brave, witty, and charismatic protagonist, is a member of the Draverna civilization's ruling council. She's renowned not for her combat prowess but for her strategic skills, intelligence, and ability to unite the divided factions. Tama's life changes dramatically when the peace of Draverna is threatened by the arrival of an opposing force from another realm, the Tyrannus Horde. Zealan, the menacing leader of the Tyrannus Horde, intends to conquer Draverna. Zealan leads a formidable army with a unified force of magical creatures, dark mages, and mystic warriors, the likes of which our world has never seen before. Witnessing the ruthlessness of Tyrannus Horde, the council quickly realizes the need for a united front. However, centuries of unrest, suspicion, and rivalry among the various clans of Draverna hamper their attempts. Realizing the council's inefficiency, Tama steps forward and takes it upon herself to mobilize reinforcements. Tama embarks on a phenomenal journey sweeping across the diverse landscapes of Draverna, from the dragon-ruled fiery caverns of Pirohok to the icy lands of Glaciera governed by the Frost Queen, and through the enchanted forests of Sylvalia, home of the elusive woodland spirits. As she traverses through these lands, Tama delivers rallying speeches, negotiates truces, builds alliances, and calls down reinforcements rallying the separated clans. In this journey, Tama faces numerous challenges, including convincing opposing clans and surviving assassination attempts from Zealan's spies. However, she remains steadfast, demonstrating exceptional courage, wisdom, and diplomatic skills. Along the way, she also uncovers secrets about her lineage that give her a unique ability to control an ancient relic, crucial to the upcoming battle. As Tama returns from her voyage, she finds her homeland on the brink of surrender to Zealan's unrelenting assault. Armed with new allies, the relic under control, Tama calls down her amassed reinforcements. United under a single banner and Tama's inspiring leadership, the inhabitants of Draverna stage a ferocious counterattack against the Tyrannus Horde, leading to a grand climax. In the end, through fierce battles and intricate strategy crafted by Tama, the Tyrannus Horde is defeated, and peace is restored to Draverna. Not only does Tama rally the clans and save her homeworld, but she also manages to unify her divided world and paves the way for a future where harmony prevails. Tama's Call is a unique story of leadership, heritage, unity, and the will that drives our heroine to safeguard her world and its inhabitants."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Context: That day, my mother picked me up from school, wearing the yellow sundress and shawl I remembered from our trip with Father the year before. She looked just like she did most days back then--a glamour queen, a movie star (\\"Just like Lena Horne,\\" my friend Chloe had once said, \\"only darker--oh, sorry, Leah!\\"), but today her beauty somehow had a harder, more defiant edge to it. I could smell the expensive Dior perfume as soon as I opened the door, which surprised me, because my mom was usually fastidious about not getting perfume on her clothes. She was wearing her bug glasses--huge dark things with lenses that bulged out like fly eyes and reflected my face like a fun-house mirror. She had tied a yellow silk scarf around her hair and was taking deep pulls on a cigarette held between two immaculately manicured fingers. Only I knew about the nicotine stains she carefully covered with her special order \\"forest sable\\" cream each morning. Tiffany, a stupid but vicious senator's daughter who I had the misfortune of sharing a classroom with, suddenly dashed from inside the school, her face flushed. \\"Hello, Mrs. Wilson,\\" she called. Before my mother could respond, she giggled and ran back to three of her friends waiting beyond the door. I could hear them laughing, but I was glad I couldn't understand their words. They were all fascinated with my mother--the black housekeeper who dressed like Katharine Hepburn and drove a Cadillac, whose daughter's \\"light toffee\\" skin indicated that she might just like her coffee with a lot of cream. Sometimes I hated those girls. \\"Get in the car, Leah,\\" my mother said. Her already husky voice was pitched low, as though she'd been crying. That made me nervous. Why was she here? \\"Ma, Chloe was going to show me her dad's new camera. Can't I go home on the bus?\\" My mom pulled on the cigarette until it burned the filter, and then ground it into the car ashtray--already filled with forty or so butts.

This is because rock layers generally build up over time in a process called sedimentation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Pete Maravich was born to Petar \\"Press\\" Maravich (1915-1987) and Helen Gravor Maravich (1925-1974) in Aliquippa, a steel town in Beaver County in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. Maravich amazed his family and friends with his basketball abilities from an early age. He enjoyed a close but demanding father-son relationship that motivated him toward achievement and fame in the sport. Maravich's father was the son of Serbian immigrants and a former professional player-turned-coach. The Atlanta Hawks selected Maravich with the third pick in the first round of the 1970 NBA draft, where he played for coach Richie Guerin. He was not a natural fit in Atlanta, as the Hawks already boasted a top-notch scorer at the guard position in Lou Hudson. In fact, Maravich's flamboyant style stood in stark contrast to the conservative play of Hudson and star center Walt Bellamy. And it did not help that many of the veteran players resented the 1.9 million contract that Maravich received from the team--a very large salary at that time. Maravich appeared in 81 games and averaged 23.2 points per contest--good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Team honors. And he managed to blend his style with his teammates, so much so that Hudson set a career high by scoring 26.8 points per game. But the team stumbled to a 36-46 record--12 wins fewer than in the previous season. Still, the Hawks qualified for the playoffs, where they lost to the New York Knicks in the first round. Maravich struggled somewhat during his second season. His scoring average dipped to 19.3 points per game, and the Hawks finished with another disappointing 36-46 record. Once again they qualified for the playoffs, and once again they were eliminated in the first round. However, Atlanta fought hard against the Boston Celtics, with Maravich averaging 27.7 points in the series. Maravich erupted in his third season, averaging 26.1 points (5th in the NBA) and dishing out 6.9 assists per game (6th in the NBA). With 2,063 points, he combined with Hudson (2,029 points) to become only the second set of teammates in league history to each score over 2,000 points in a single season. The Hawks soared to a 46-36 record, but again bowed out in the first round of the playoffs. However, the season was good enough to earn Maravich his first-ever appearance in the NBA All-Star Game, and also All-NBA Second Team honors. The following season (1973-74) was his best yet--at least in terms of individual accomplishments. Maravich posted 27.7 points per game--second in the league behind Bob McAdoo--and earned his second appearance in the All-Star Game. However, Atlanta sank to a disappointing 35-47 record and missed the postseason entirely.

Write a title for this article: More than most technologies I can think of, the E Ink screens used in monochrome e-readers such as Barnes & Noble’s Nook Simple Touch and Amazon.com’s Kindle Touch present a stark set of tradeoffs. If you don’t mind the lack of color, their virtues are considerable: they don’t get bleached out in bright sun and allow for an e-reader to go for weeks between charges. But the same E Ink displays that are wonderfully legible in bright light are impossible to read in a dark room. And if the lighting is so-so — like it is on, say, an airplane — E Ink displays are readable, but murky and not very appealing. In either of these cases, you’re far better of with a color LCD such as the ones on B&N’s Nook Tablet and Nook Color, Amazon’s Kindle Fire and the iPad. But now bookselling behemoth Barnes & Noble has a fix. It’s called the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight, and it’s an E Ink Nook with a 6″ screen that lights up on demand. I got a hands-on sneak peek today and was generally impressed. Illuminated E Ink isn’t a new idea: Sony released one of its Readers with a lit screen back in 2009. But in that version, the lighting hurt the clarity of the screen. The company dropped the feature in later models. Judging from my demo of the Nook with GlowLight, Barnes & Noble has figured out how to make the idea make sense. This Simple Touch is essentially the same as its appealing predecessor — which remains available — except that when you press and hold the e-reader’s “N” button, LEDs along the edge of the display turn on, blanketing the screen in light. The illumination isn’t perfectly even — I could make out discrete beams emanating from the LEDs along the top edge — but it’s bright enough to make the display perfectly legible in very dark environments, without lighting up the entire room in the way that backlit LCD displays tend to do. (That’s an important point if you’re reading in bed and someone else is trying to sleep.) In a room in which the lighting is merely mediocre rather than almost non-existent, GlowLight still makes a difference — it gets rid of the grayishness of standard E Ink. I’d certainly prefer it, although it does make it more obvious that you’re looking at an electronic display. (You can adjust the brightness to your liking — and with any luck, the Nook kiosks in Barnes & Noble stores will set things up so you can judge the screen with your own eyeballs.) The lighting option would be useful even if it was a ravenous battery hog, but according to B&N’s claims, it appears to be reasonably efficient. The company says that the Simple Touch with GlowLight will go for two months between charges if you don’t use the light at all; if you use it for a half-hour a day, you’ll still get a month on a charge. Presumably, that translates into about fifteen hours of continuous use with the light on. (It shuts off automatically after five minutes of no usage, so you won’t kill the battery if you fall asleep with the light on.) Barnes & Noble says that the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight will be available in early May at its own stores, Best Buy, Target, Walmart and other retailers; it’ll sell for 139. The non-lit Simple Touch will stay around at 99. Amazon, meanwhile, has a non-touch Kindle at 99 (or 79 with “special offer” ads), the Kindle Touch at 139 (or 99 with special offers) and the Kindle Touch with 3G at 189 (or 149 with special offers). Sony’s Reader is 129. And I’m not even going to mention other contenders such as Kobo. (Whoops, I just did!) Whew. That’s a lot of choices. At 139, the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight competes most directly with Amazon’s no-special-offers Kindle Touch. And the lit screen is a pretty compelling selling point — at least as long as you haven’t already sunk much money into a collection of Kindle books, since they can’t be read on the Nook. Me, I do most of my e-reading on my iPad; it may be much bigger, heavier, and pricier than any of the E Ink readers, but I almost always have it with me anyhow. Still, there seems to be a healthy market for more traditional e-readers. I’m pleased to see that they’re continuing to evolve, and I’m curious to see how long this Nook’s GlowLight screen remains a unique point in its favor.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Pete Carlton is a young Montreal boy with terminal cancer. He has a love for butterflies, and often watches entomologist Alan Osborne's television show. His mother, Teresa, meets with Osborne, to try to get him to take her son to Costa Rica to find the rare Blue Morpho butterfly. However, he dismisses her, but later comes to their home upon receiving a phone call from Pete saying he would go to Central America himself. The two arrive at a small village when they learn the blue morphos have already migrated. Heartbroken, they prepare to leave, until they find one is still in the jungle. They chase after it several times, but are unable to catch it.

Pete escapes to get help, but it only leads to him being lost, suffering from hallucinations. Osborne is rescued, and as they are leaving to a hospital for Osborne, a friendly villager reveals she has caught the butterfly, giving it to Pete. As he is about to kill it for his collection, he lets it go so it can make more of the magical butterflies.

The farmer tried to put the milk in the jar but the","completion":"jar was already filled with a concoction of other liquids, that he had been experimenting with for months in an attempt to create a new type of fertilizer for his farmland. The combination of various organic ingredients, such as decomposing plants, cow manure, and even some kitchen scraps, had created a pungent and potent mixture that he believed could revolutionize the farming industry. As a result, he had meticulously noted down his observations and any changes to the concoction's composition in a small, tattered notebook that he carried with him at all times. The farmer was no ordinary man; he possessed an insatiable curiosity for innovative agricultural techniques and had spent years researching and implementing various strategies to optimize crop yields, soil health, and overall farm sustainability. His dedication to farming had driven him to explore unconventional methods and ideas that often left his neighbors and fellow farmers skeptical of his ambitious pursuits. However, he knew that in order to progress and generate more sustainable and responsible farming practices, he had to venture beyond traditional methods and challenge existing paradigms. On this particular day, as the sun rose above the horizon, casting a golden glow across his bucolic property, the farmer, wearing his worn-out overalls and a dusty straw hat, found himself in a bit of a predicament. The milk that he had collected from his small herd of cows, which he affectionately referred to as \\"his girls,\\" needed to be stored in a proper container, lest it spoil and go to waste. The unavailability of a clean jar in his quaint, cluttered kitchen posed a minor but irritating inconvenience. Regardless, his quick-thinking and resourceful nature took over, and he began scouring the nearby storage shed for a suitable container. Shelves packed with old gardening tools, rusty cans of paint, and outdated farming equipment lined the dimly lit walls of the cramped space, making it difficult to navigate. But the farmer's determination did not wane. Eventually, he stumbled upon a dusty glass jug nestled between a sack of grain and a broken wheelbarrow in the far corner of the shed. It was sizable enough to hold the milk, and apart from a thin layer of dust, it appeared to be in pristine condition, free of any cracks or damage. After giving it a thorough rinse with water from the well, he carefully poured the milk into the now-gleaming jug, ensuring not a single drop was wasted. With this seemingly trivial task completed, the farmer paused to consider the implications of his latest experimental concoction. If his hunch was correct, and the fertilizing mixture proved to be as effective as he anticipated, it could revolutionize not only his own techniques but those of his fellow agriculturists, paving the road towards a greener and more sustainable future for all. But for now, he had to focus on his daily farm chores, their importance not diminished by his grand aspirations; the cows needed milking, crops tending, and fences mending. With a renewed sense of purpose, he set off to conquer the challenges of the day, fueled by his passion for the land and the promise of progress."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Observation is Sarah's stronger suit, but not Carrie because Sarah has always relied on her innate ability to notice details and read people. She has never had any formal training in observation, but she developed this skill growing up in a household where she had to pay close attention to her surroundings to navigate complex family dynamics. On the other hand, Carrie's strength lies in her ability to analyze data and solve problems logically, which makes her an excellent strategist and planner, but she has never had any training in being observant, either. In this scenario, the story continuation is based on option (a). 2. Observation is Sarah's stronger suit, but not Carrie because Sarah has spent years honing her skills in paying close attention to visual and auditory cues – observational data that many people might otherwise miss. This has helped make her an expert in her field and has led to numerous breakthroughs in her career. Carrie, however, focuses mainly on her own area of expertise, which relies more on quantitative analysis and technical know-how, so she hasn't invested time in improving her observational skills. Thus, she has no training in being observant like Sarah does. In this scenario, the story continuation is related to option (b) but with some additional context.

Given the following context: During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers. Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws. Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly.

Even though 'the naked mile' and this one are the two worst, this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series. First of all, the best part of the film was that it was an American Pie film, which is always appreciated. However, there are tonnes of bad things to say about this film. First of all, the story has a very stale 'arc' structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the pledging of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of which has exactly 25 minutes of length. Apart from the general staleness of the plot, there is little to no character development, which makes a double whammy of a bad plot. Apart from that, I deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film. That is, showing the jocks as the extremely cool, only-thinking-about-sex guys, and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior. Also, it shows females only as sexual objects, and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects. Apart from that, the acting was also poor. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley. So, in the end, a generally horrid film, if seen from a critical point of view. If seen from a teen point of view, I guess that it's better, but this film is rated 18+ in most countries, so it shouldn't really be seen by minors.

Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

However, in general, \\"this is the one\\" can be seen as a positive statement based on the following reasoning: 1. The sentence indicates that the speaker has identified something they consider to be the right choice, solution, or desired outcome. This identification suggests a sense of satisfaction or resolution, which tends to evoke positive feelings. 2. There is no clear indication of negativity in the statement. Negative sentiment is typically expressed through terms like \\"not,\\" \\"nobody,\\" \\"nothing,\\" or \\"disappointment.\\" Since the given sentence does not contain any of these elements, it is less likely to be viewed as negative. 3. The phrase \\"the one\\" is often associated with being unique, special, or perfectly fitting the criteria. This has positive connotations, as it indicates that the speaker has found something outstanding and desirable. However, it is essential to understand that context plays a critical role in determining sentiment.

Question 1: What are some examples of statutory law? Question 2: What are statutory laws? What are some example? Pick your answer from: I. no. II. yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Statutory laws are laws that are enacted by a legislative body, such as a parliament, congress, or state legislature. They are written laws created through legislative processes and are usually detailed and specific. They are contrasted with common law, which is made up of decisions made by judges and court opinions, and constitutional law, which derives from a nation's constitution. Now, let's address both questions and provide examples for each. Question 1: What are some examples of statutory law? 1. Criminal Codes: A criminal code is a body of laws defining various criminal offenses and prescribing the corresponding legal penalties. Examples may include the United States Code, which contains federal criminal offenses and their punishments, or the state-level criminal codes in various US states. 2. Tax Laws: These are laws that govern taxation policies and procedures for individuals and businesses. Examples include the Internal Revenue Code in the United States, which outlines federal tax laws, and the tax codes for each state in the US governing state-level taxes. 3. Employment and Labor Laws: These laws protect the rights of workers and ensure fair conditions and workplace safety. Some examples are the United States Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor standards, or the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which regulates workplace safety. 4. Consumer Protection Laws: Such laws protect consumers by ensuring fair trade practices, regulating marketing/advertising, and establishing product safety standards. Examples include the United States Federal Trade Commission Act, which aims to prevent unfair or deceptive trade practices, and the Consumer Product Safety Act, which sets safety standards for consumer products. 5. Intellectual Property Laws: These laws protect the rights of creators and inventors concerning their creations and innovations. Examples include the United States Patent Act, which grants patents for inventions, or the Copyright Act, which protects authors' rights to their original works. Question 2: What are statutory laws? What are some examples? As mentioned earlier, statutory laws are written laws enacted by a legislative body. They are designed to address specific policies and resolve certain issues within society, and they can vary according to the jurisdiction that enacts them. Some additional examples of statutory laws include: 1. Environmental Laws: These laws are designed to protect the environment and regulate human activities that might impact it. Examples include the United States Clean Air Act, which regulates air pollution, or the Clean Water Act, which governs the discharge of pollutants into water bodies. 2. Family Laws: Family laws govern legal matters related to marriage, divorce, adoption, and child custody. Some examples are the United States Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, which helps to prevent interstate conflicts related to child custody, or individual state marriage and divorce laws. 3. Education Laws: Education laws regulate various aspects of the education system, such as funding, instructional standards, and student rights. Examples include the United States Every Student Succeeds Act, which sets national educational standards, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, ensuring that children with disabilities have access to public education. As to whether questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing, the answer is no. While both questions ask about statutory laws and seek examples, they vary in focus. Question 1 specifically only asks for examples, whereas question 2 requests a definition of statutory laws along with examples."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The hypothesis, in contrast, suggests that they have a shorter season. These two statements are contradictory; therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically derived from, or entailed by, the premise. To better understand this, let's break down the arguments: Premise: - They play a lot. - They play for a longer season. Hypothesis: - They have a shorter season. The premise provides information that supports the idea of them playing extensively and for an extended period, while the hypothesis proposes the opposite - a shorter season. In order to determine if a hypothesis is entailed by a premise, there should be a logical and consistent connection between the two statements, where the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise. In this case, since the two statements contradict each other, there is no logical connection, and therefore the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Recommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence-and counterterrorism-is now dysfunctional. Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development\\" is \\"Funding\\"?","completion":"No, sweetie, that's not quite right. According to the passage, the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development is not funding, but the fact that the leaders of the Department of Homeland Security have to appear before 88 different committees and subcommittees of Congress.

This camp screwball comedy of errors, that includes many over-the-top stereotypes, is set at Halloween against the backdrop of West Hollywood, California. Five friends, interior designer Evan (played by London); interior designer Harvey (played by Cheng); African American stockbroker Dave (played by Meadows); Latino spinning instructor Fredrico (played by Sabàto); and Emme (played by Ubach), a sassy young woman obsessed with style and classic movies, have all been anticipating the West Hollywood Halloween Parade on Santa Monica Boulevard, which is the biggest and brashest block party of the year. Their annual tradition of joining the festivities in outrageous costumes has become part of local legend. It is the night before Halloween, however, and they still have not decided what to be. Evan and Harvey, who are femme gay boyfriends and business partners, have come up with food-themed sushi costumes that everyone refers to as \\"wasabi tuna.\\" Emme offers another suggestion — that they all dress up as gang members. They all opt for the gang theme, but are unable to find the appropriate attire at the local stores. They then decide to seek out real life gang members in order to achieve the authentic, straight-from-the-hood look they want. While doing interior design work for an extremely wealthy Armenian woman who is actually in the illegal drug trade, Harvey and Evan become unwitting drug couriers. After they are arrested, there is a comic scene at the WeHo sheriff's station with them attempting to talk their way out of trouble. Dave goes to East L.A., where he comes across a real gang member named Romeo (played by Díaz). He makes a deal with Romeo to loan him his Porsche in exchange for his lowrider gang car. A case of mistaken identity makes a vengeful, rival gang get after them. There is a comic drive-by shooting scene.

Write an article based on this \\"Avoid swallowing air. Practice good posture. Get enough sleep. Find a fitness-positive support network. Start tracking your weight.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Mastering Healthy Habits: Optimize Your Wellness Journey with Effective Strategies Introduction In today's fast-paced world, it can be all too easy to fall into unhealthy habits that can take a toll on our physical and mental well-being. However, making positive changes to improve our health doesn't have to be complicated. By focusing on a few key strategies, we can achieve better health and lead a more fulfilling life. In this article, we'll explore simple yet effective ways to avoid swallowing air, practice good posture, get enough sleep, find a fitness-positive support network, and start tracking your weight. By incorporating these habits into your daily routine, you'll pave the way for a healthier, happier you. 1. Avoid Swallowing Air Swallowing air, also known as aerophagia, can lead to bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort. Consequently, it's essential to be aware of the situations where this can occur and take steps to minimize it. One common cause of aerophagia is consuming food and drinks rapidly. To avoid swallowing excess air, practice mindful eating by chewing your food thoroughly and sipping beverages slowly. Additionally, pay attention to your breathing while eating – try to breathe through your nose, not your mouth. Other potential causes of swallowing air include chewing gum, smoking, and using a straw when drinking. By reducing or eliminating these habits, you can reduce the amount of air you swallow and improve your overall digestive health. 2. Practice Good Posture Good posture is essential for many reasons, from avoiding back pain to maintaining proper alignment of your spine and joints. To improve your posture, start by being aware of how you sit, stand, and move throughout the day. When sitting, keep your feet flat on the floor, with your knees and hips level and your back straight. Additionally, use lumbar support if necessary and avoid crossing your legs, as this can lead to poor circulation. When standing, distribute your weight evenly across both feet and maintain a straight spine with your shoulders pulled back. As you move, focus on engaging your core muscles to support your posture and maintain alignment. Incorporating exercises that focus on strengthening your core and back muscles can also help improve your posture over time. Consider adding yoga, Pilates, or resistance training to your fitness routine to target these key areas. 3. Get Enough Sleep Proper sleep is crucial for overall health, as it allows our bodies to recover and replenish both physically and mentally. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night, and prioritize establishing a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time daily, even on weekends. Create an environment conducive to sleep by keeping your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool. Implement a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading, meditating, or gentle stretching, to help signal your body that it's time for rest. Reduce your exposure to screens and electronic devices at least an hour before bedtime to minimize the effects of blue light on your sleep quality. 4. Find a Fitness-Positive Support Network Having a supportive network of friends, family members, or coworkers who share your fitness goals can significantly improve your chances of success. A fitness-positive support network can help keep you accountable, motivated, and engaged in your wellness journey. Join a local gym, fitness class, or online community where you can connect with like-minded individuals who share your passion for health and wellbeing. Participate in group fitness events or challenges, and celebrate your accomplishments together. Share your goals, progress, and setbacks with your support network, allowing them to offer encouragement, advice, or even a friendly challenge to keep you on track. 5. Start Tracking Your Weight Monitoring your weight is an essential tool for managing your overall health and staying on track with your fitness goals. Regular weigh-ins can help detect fluctuations in weight that may indicate changes in lifestyle, diet, or overall health. Choose a consistent time and day of the week to weigh yourself, ideally first thing in the morning after using the restroom and before eating or drinking. Use a high-quality, accurate scale, and record your weight in a log or app. Tracking your weight over time allows you to identify trends, patterns, and areas that may require adjustment or further attention. Conclusion By implementing these five strategies into your life, you put yourself on a path toward better health, improved well-being, and a more balanced lifestyle. Remember, change takes time, and developing healthy habits requires consistent effort. Celebrate your small victories and progress along the way, and never underestimate the power of a solid foundation of healthy habits in achieving a happier, healthier you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie plot title: The Keys of the Kingdom Movie plot: Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck) is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) at his parish in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A gripping tale of two young lovers whose forbidden love crosses the boundaries of rival kingdoms and marital commitment. At the film's commencement, Britain is at war with Ireland, and the English lords and barons are seeking to form an alliance to overturn the ruthless Irish king, Donnchadh. However, on the night they are to sign treaties to unite their kingdom, the Irish penetrate the Castle Tantallion, slaughtering all but a few of the English. Among these is young Tristan of Eragon, whose life is saved by Lord Marke, Britain's only promising leader remaining.As Tristan enters his young adult years, having been raised and nurtured by Lord Marke, he uses his sharpened knowledge and cunning battle skills to fight bravely against the Irish when they cross into the Land of Cornwall. Though he defeats their strongest warrior, Morholt, he suffers a fatal strike of poison, and is presumed dead with his fellow martyrs. The triumphant English soldiers return with a bittersweet victory, and inform Lord Marke of the grievous loss.However, when Tristan's burial vessel washes ashore the Irish coast, he is found by the beautiful Princess Isolde, daughter of King Donnchadh, who discovers that he is indeed alive.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge. Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet (3.4 m) wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet (46 m), too far for their ropes to reach. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations.

Context: One day after a mass shooting killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his support for a plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said. But a recent Brookings Institution survey found Americans are far more welcoming of refugees than the billionaire candidate. Of those surveyed, 59 percent support accepting refugees, while 41 percent oppose it. Those views are split right down party lines, with just 38 percent of Republicans supporting taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared to 77 percent of Democrats.

Plot title: The Damned United Movie plot: After failing to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is sacked and replaced by Don Revie, the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie is replaced at Leeds by Brian Clough, a former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds's style of play under Revie. Much attention is called to the fact that Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor has not joined him at Leeds, and Clough claims in an interview to Yorkshire Television that the team cannot possibly have been happy under Revie, due to the violent and physical nature of their game.The roots of Clough's conflict with Revie are depicted as happening in a 1967 FA Cup match between Leeds, who were then leading the First Division (though they did not win it that season) and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough assumes Revie to be a similar man to himself, owing to the fact that they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough; come the day of the match however, Revie either ignores Clough or fails to make him out in the crowd upon entering Derby's Baseball Ground stadium. The match proves to be a tough affair, and despite their best efforts Derby lose 20 to Leeds. Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, but he and Taylor recognise that their side simply aren't good enough on a technical level and so remedy the problem by signing veteran Dave Mackay, along with several other young players. The club's frugal chairman, Sam Longson is extremely anxious about the investment and more so the fact that Clough didn't bother to consult him about signing Mackay. However, Derby win the Second Division title in 1969, and the following season once more face up to Leeds, the defending First Division champions... and promptly lose 50.Back in the storyline's \\"present,\\" Clough almost immediately alienates his Leeds players by telling them that they can throw away all their medals and trophies, because \\"[they] never won any of them fairly.\\" The season starts with a Charity Shield match...

Q: The stable contact of ISW2 with nucleosomal DNA approximately 20 bp from the dyad was shown by DNA footprinting and photoaffinity labeling using recombinant histone octamers to require the histone H4 N-terminal tail. Efficient ISW2 remodeling also required the H4 N-terminal tail, although the lack of the H4 tail can be mostly compensated for by increasing the incubation time or concentration of ISW2. Similarly, the length of extranucleosomal DNA affected the stable contact of ISW2 with this same internal nucleosomal site, with the optimal length being 70 to 85 bp. These data indicate the histone H4 tail, in concert with a favorable length of extranucleosomal DNA, recruits and properly orients ISW2 onto the nucleosome for efficient nucleosome remodeling. One consequence of this property of ISW2 is likely its previously observed nucleosome spacing activity.

Sentence 1: Ten years ago, a judge was someone you saw behind the bench when you went to court. Sentence 2: Ten years ago, the judges would fight law on the street. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The truth of the second statement does not necessarily follow from the truth of the first. The first sentence describes a traditional perspective of a judge, who presides over court proceedings, interprets laws, and makes rulings based on presented evidence. This is a widely accepted role of a judge all around the globe, and has been for a significant period, hence its likely truth. The second sentence, on the other hand, suggests that judges were actively involved in enforcing law on the streets ten years ago. This is not a customary role for judges. It should be noted that enforcing laws - in the form of apprehending offenders, maintaining peace, responding to emergencies - is typically the duty of the police or other law enforcement agencies, not judges. While there may be exceptions, based on varying jurisdictions and unique circumstances, it is generally not a part of a judge's job description to \\"fight law on the street.\\" Thus, the truth of the second sentence doesn't logically follow from the first one. Each sentence should be evaluated for its validity independently, based on the norms, rules, and responsibilities pertaining to judges in the specified geographical and legal context. Moreover, there is a lack of contextual connection between the two sentences. The first statement talks about the role of a judge in a courtroom, and the second one suggests a more active, outdoor role. These scenarios are not necessarily opposite but they target different aspects of legal enforcement that are typically fulfilled by distinct roles within the legal system.

Summarize this article: Carry a notebook with you wherever you go and capture the ideas that pop into your head at the time they appear. Few people can afford to be novelists-in-residence without some income source earned by fair means or foul. Unless you're Alain de Botton, who writes living off an inheritance (although now his writing makes the money too), you'd best make the time wherever it's free. Use your time on the bus to and from work, during lunch, after dinner, on the weekends, during vacation blocks. Asking for time off work to write a bestseller should be done with care. Judge the nature of your workplace first––the more conservative the establishment, the less likely this will be something considered worth their loss of your time. Bestsellers do not need to be the best written; some may well be, but it can also take many years before the public catches up with such genius unless you also manage to win a literary prize. If you want to be great now, just start typing or writing, get it down and then fiddle with it later. Procrastination and perfection are the enemies of the bestseller. A plan, an outline, whatever you will. You can mind map it if you prefer. There are lots of rules for doing this. You can even read those too if you like. Or you can just get stuck into it and write, write, write. Not everyone does this the color-by-numbers way, so find your own path. Fiction: Set out the characters, their traits and quirks, their motivations. This should be fun; fill them out as they grow in your mind. If they're based on your neighbor or ex-lover, make sure they're unrecognizable unless you enjoy being sued. And write out the situations you want to develop in your book, the plot so to speak, the series of events, be they fortunate or not so fortunate. And how will this all end? A cliffhanger, a surprise, a happy ending or a kaboom and everyone dies? Non-fiction: Consider the need for sections, methods, parts––how will you break things down? Chapters can be nested inside sections, etc. Say you're writing about people's love of apple pies. Section one could cover what the apple pie is, with stories of people waxing nostalgic about apple pies from years gone by. Section two is where to source the best apples for pie making. Section three is a stack of apple pie recipes. Section four is troubleshooting failed apple pies. Section five is photos of your favorite apple pies off Instagram. And so forth... Some topics, like cats and beer, people will never get enough of and all you need to do is have a modern, current angle. Other things that are way too cliched, like celebrities and pop music, and you'll need funky new ways of bringing such over-written topics to people's attention that they don't already know. Is the writing taking you where you want it to? Is it good, interesting, fathomable, fascinating, gripping, useful, entertaining, sparkling, witty, trendy, or whatever combination of such things you're trying to make it? Don't be afraid of splitting elements off for other projects. Sometimes you are mid-stream writing about one thing and another insists on birthing itself. Write it down, label it and put it aside for your next project. Avoid trying to add too much to the one piece you're writing now. After all, should you manage the bestseller, you'll need to produce more after and these side ideas are perfect germs of new bestsellers for later. Miss it various times. Set more deadlines. Miss those too. After all, life has a habit of getting in the way. Eventually, set the uncrossable deadline and mean it. This time, finish the book. Enough already! There is a point at which you must choose between being an author-in-waiting and a published-author-hoping-for-a-bestseller. Decide and get on with the writing to completion. Be realistic. A book on the lost herd of rice carving gnus of outer Mongolia will likely take longer than a fiction piece about vampires destroying the local tea party. Especially if you need to budget the money and travel to outer Mongolia to verify the research. Deep research can take years; you can nudge your imagination quite a bit faster. Holes can be filled in later. That is what friendly reviewers and your not-so-friendly editors are for, pre-publication. Listen to them; they can see the trees you keep missing for being deep in the proverbial forest. Summary:","completion":"To write a bestseller, carry a notebook with you to capture ideas as they arise. Utilize free time on commutes, during lunch breaks, and on weekends to write. Be aware that not all bestsellers are best-written, so avoid procrastination and perfection. Create a plan or outline, and develop characters and plot for fiction, or create sections and chapters with clear information for non-fiction. Determine whether your writing is meeting the intended tone and purpose, and be open to splitting ideas into separate projects. Be prepared to miss deadlines, but eventually set a final deadline and complete your work.

Short movie review: in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"The critic likely perceives the movie in a negative light based on the provided short movie review. By examining the review in greater detail, we can infer the reasoning behind this conclusion. The critic starts with the phrase \\"in the film's drumbeat about authenticity.\\" The use of the word \\"drumbeat\\" can be interpreted as an emphasis on a central theme or idea in the movie, which in this case, is authenticity. However, the reviewer goes on to imply that this emphasis on authenticity is undermined by certain aspects of the film. Next, the review mentions the \\"stale plot,\\" which indicates that the critic found the storyline unoriginal and uninspiring. A stale plot typically means a lack of innovation in storytelling, leaving viewers with a sense of predictability and dissatisfaction, contributing to a negative view of the movie. The phrase \\"pornographic way\\" represents another criticism, suggesting that the movie indulges excessively in displaying material wealth and luxury. The emphasis on \\"swank apartments, clothes, and parties\\" implies that the movie focuses too much on the superficial and materialistic aspects rather than delving into deeper emotional or intellectual territory. This can be perceived as shallow and detracts from the film's overall impact. In conclusion, the critic appears to have a negative view of the movie, criticizing its emphasis on authenticity while also highlighting its stale plot and its excessive indulgence in materialism and superficiality. These critiques indicate that the reviewer did not find the movie particularly engaging or effective in delivering a meaningful experience to its audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One afternoon after the final exam,we four girls came to a small wood and we felt _ only belonging to us that afternoon.We talked and laughed.We played all the games that we could think of.We felt we were on the top of the world for the first time in our life.We totally forgot the unhappiness in our life and we threw the homework and the endless exams far away out of the wood. In the middle of the wood ran a small and peaceful stream.Now and then,we could see some wild ducks on the water looking for food.The water weeds danced happily while the water passed beside them.The air was so fresh that we breathed it freely. The sun had set before we knew it.We had to leave the place which brought us much happiness.We agreed to come back again every time we felt bored. Years later,we went there several times.But,every time we went there to find that great feeling,we failed.Strangely,the feeling was different from that of several years ago.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write highlights for this article: For a comedy like \\"The Change-Up\\" -- which is to say, a comedy with a message about as deep as a bowl of beer nuts -- familiarity with Shakespeare's disguise plays and Aesop's Fables isn't a prerequisite for getting the picture. On the other hand, familiarity with both body-switch comedies and Judd Apatow laffers is indispensable for understanding just where this raunchy Apatow imitation with a heart of Lipitor goes wrong. The anatomy swappers here are Mitch (Ryan Reynolds), a swingin', irresponsible single guy, and Dave (Jason Bateman), a driven lawyer/husband/dad. The switcheroo goes down because the two buddies-since-childhood do something stupid during a Guys' Night Out in their hometown of Atlanta: They pee in a fountain. Specifically, they pee in a fountain presided over by a stony statue of the Greek goddess Metis while drunkenly declaring to each other, ''I wish I had your life!'' (For the record, Metis is the goddess of counsel, advice, planning, and cunning.) Dave thinks he envies Mitch's life of free sex and fiscal irresponsibility. Mitch, a wannabe actor, thinks he envies Dave's successful career, his loving home life, and his cute wife (Leslie Mann). Crash, lightning, temporary power outage, \\"Freaky Friday!\\" The deal is done. The next day each guy wakes up in the body of the other. Discovery of genital distinctions follows. Here's \\"The Change-Up's\\" first mistake: As set up by director David Dobkin (\\"Wedding Crashers\\") and writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore(\\"The Hangover\\"), the game is rigged. Dave may be burned-out, so much so that he has stopped appreciating his squeaky Leslie Mann of a wife. He may even feel a pang or two of extramarital lust at the sight of his beautiful law associate Sabrina -- as played by Olivia Wilde, who wouldn't? But no one would envy Mitch's directionless, idiotic Peter Pan life -- even if Peter entertains the ladies in a playpen of an apartment. The early Mitch is so excessively unsocialized and unlikable (I blame the script and direction rather than Reynolds' game performance) that there's no contest: Dave may need a little kick in the khakis to realize that he's got it pretty good at home, but he's clearly the movie's winner. In fact, early Mitch is so obnoxious that in the end, when the two friends regain their own bodies, having learned lessons in gratitude (oops, did I give something away?), Dave is more or less Dave again. But Mitch 2.0 bears little resemblance to early Mitch. He's still Ryan Reynolds-y, but he's now someone a lot more like Dave -- reformed by the traditional values \\"The Change-Up\\" endorses -- than like a guy who previously kept a weekly sex date with a lady he described as a tigress. I won't give away more about the tigress in question; let's just say she bounces and veers from \\"Hangover\\" turf into Farrelly brothers territory. And she also personifies \\"The Change-Up's\\" second mistake: The movie's scenes of id-fueled transgression are alternately desperate, trite, and an off-putting color of ugly -- as if the filmmakers were given the ingredients but not the cooking instructions for a successful crude-but-cuddly frittata. Gross-outs involving poop -- kids of all ages usually love 'em! -- are more humiliating than hilarious. (Really, the old toxic-baby-diaper gag?) Freakish-looking women are easy receptacles for disgust. And when jokes give way to the ''I love you, bro!'' finale, the tone oozes past charming happiness all the way to cloying self-satisfaction. Anyway! There's one consolation, and that's in watching the stars play opposite what is often their type of guy. Bateman, in particular, is enjoyably nimble and unbuttoned when he sheds his usual persona of responsible-and-exasperated guy and lets some devil out. Quick-witted and a pro at physical shifts, he finds more subtleties in his Dave Gone Wild than actually appear in his dialogue. And that resourcefulness rubs off on Reynolds, a pleasant if less complex performer. Acting here as if he were a vaguely disgruntled but resigned grown-up, Reynolds gets to escape the tonal confines of his boyish smile. Too bad \\"The Change-Up\\" has little use for such interestingness. Soon enough it's back to stale jokes about spousal date nights, the sight of moldy fast-food leftovers in a bachelor's refrigerator, and the timeless male joys of sharing a whiz in an outdoor fountain after a night of drinking and bulls---.

The film begins with tired lawyer, husband and father Dave envying Mitch's carefree and irresponsible lifestyle and wannabe actor Mitch longing for Dave's successful career and family life. However, the storyline is rigged with no balanced comparison between the two characters, making Dave and his stable life the obvious winner from the outset. The film's first mistake is that early Mitch is so excessively unsocialized and unlikable that there is no contest between the two friends' lives. As a result, instead of the characters truly learning or growing from each other's experiences, the realizations are superficial, and the development of their friendship appears forced and insincere. Furthermore, the film's humor often relies on unnecessary gross-outs and tarnishes the overall appeal. On a positive note, the leading actors, Bateman and Reynolds, display commendable performances and play against their usual stereotypes. Bateman is particularly enjoyable with his quick wit, physical comedy, and playful expressions. However, the film's lack of depth and reliance on crude humor result in wasted potential and missed opportunities for a more engaging and relatable story. In conclusion, \\"The Change-Up\\" attempts to deliver a raucous comedy centered around the lives of two friends swapping bodies and learning about each other's worlds. However, the film is marred by a skewed comparison of the characters, forced lessons, and excessive reliance on crude humor. Despite commendable performances from Bateman and Reynolds, \\"The Change-Up\\" falls short in delivering a heartfelt and engaging story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Why was Captain William Kidd hanged in 1701?","completion":"Captain William Kidd, born in Scotland in 1645, was a prominent privateer and occasional pirate whose controversial life and subsequent hanging in 1701 have elicited much debate among historians. Kidd's life began to take a pivotal turn in 1695 when he was commissioned as a privateer by England, tasked with the mission of hunting and capturing pirates and enemy French ships in the eastern waters, particularly in the Indian Ocean. To understand the circumstances that led to Captain Kidd's hanging, it is essential to delve into various aspects of his life, which include his early voyages, political entanglements, misjudgments, and eventual downfall. 1. Early voyages: From humble beginnings as a seafarer, Kidd rose to prominence due to his expertise in navigating the seas and conducting daring ship raids. In 1695, Kidd was offered a captaincy by various prominent British politicians and businessmen who saw an opportunity for wealth by financing Kidd's privateering adventures. His orders were to patrol the seas with the intent of protecting British interests, specifically targeting pirates and French vessels. 2. Political entanglements: Despite his commission as a lawful privateer, Captain Kidd was sponsored by influential British political figures, including Richard Coote, the Earl of Bellomont, and even King William III. These patrons hoped to profit from Kidd's captures. Over time, Kidd's association with these aristocratic backers and the potential wealth he could bring placed him in a precarious situation, wherein his actions were closely scrutinized by both his supporters and opponents. 3. Misjudgments: While Captain Kidd began his voyage as a privateer, he faced difficulties in controlling his crew, who were not happy with the lack of plunder. Kidd's crew consisted of a diverse group of men, some of whom already had criminal records or had previously engaged in piracy. Furthermore, his ship, the Adventure Galley, was in a constant state of disrepair. In an effort to placate his crew, secure his financial future, and fulfill his obligations to his patrons, Kidd made ill-advised decisions that eventually led to his participation in acts of piracy. 4. The incident with the Quedagh Merchant: The turning point in Kidd's career occurred in January 1698, when he captured the Armenian ship Quedagh Merchant, carrying a valuable cargo of gold, silver, and valuable goods. This ship was alleged to be sailing under a French Patente, which would have made it a legitimate target. However, after investigation, it was discovered that the captain of the Quedagh Merchant was an Englishman, making the seizure an act of piracy. This unlawful capture tarnished Kidd's reputation and marked the beginning of his descent into infamy. 5. Return to New York and arrest: After disposing of the Adventure Galley and attempting to conceal any ties to piracy, Captain Kidd returned to New York in 1699 in the hopes of clearing his name. However, his influential backers withdrew their support in an effort to save their own reputations. Kidd's political opponents capitalized on the situation, resulting in his arrest on charges of piracy and the murder of a crew member, William Moore. Kidd was subsequently extradited to England for trial. 6. Trial and execution: Captain Kidd's trial began in May 1701. Despite mounting a defense that argued his actions were the result of disloyal crew members and an attempt to maintain order, Kidd was found guilty of piracy and the murder of William Moore. On May 23, 1701, Kidd was hanged at Execution Dock in London. His body was then tarred and displayed in a gibbet along the Thames River as a warning to other potential pirates. In conclusion, the hanging of Captain William Kidd in 1701 was the culmination of a series of missteps and political entanglements that essentially painted him as a notorious pirate. While Kidd had set out as a lawful privateer with the backing of influential British patrons, his inability to control his crew, the plundering of the wrong ships, and the subsequent withdrawal of political support led to his hanging, which solidified his place in history as a symbol of piracy and treachery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: - Items that can be reused are placed into recycling containers - Recycling trucks pick up the items that are able to be reused - The recyclable items travel to a recycling plant - The items are sorted by what they are made of - The items are broken down into small parts - The small parts are melted to make new raw parts What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process would be to manufacture and distribute new products made from the recycled materials. After the small parts have been melted down to create new raw materials, these materials are then molded or transformed into new products or packaging, depending on their composition and intended use. This final stage of the recycling process involves various steps, including: 1. Shaping the recycled raw materials: The recycled materials are transformed into sheets, pellets, rolls, or other suitable forms which can be utilized in the manufacturing process. For example, plastic pellets can be molded into a variety of different products, such as bottles, containers, or even new recycling bins. 2. Manufacturing the new products: Once the recycled raw materials have been shaped, they are used to manufacture new products. New products may range from household items and electronics to construction materials, clothing, and more. This stage of the process often involves multiple manufacturers, who produce a wide array of new items. 3. Quality control: Before the new products are distributed, they undergo thorough inspection and testing to ensure they meet the required quality standards. This step is vital, as the recycled materials need to be suitable for their intended purpose and safe for consumers. 4. Packaging: Once the quality control tests have been passed, the new products made from recycled materials are packaged for storage and transportation. The packaging should also be recyclable or made from environmentally-friendly materials wherever possible. 5. Distribution: Following successful quality control and packaging, the new products are distributed to various outlets, such as wholesalers, retailers, and directly to consumers. Transportation methods should also strive to be eco-friendly in an effort to minimize the overall environmental impact. 6. Consumer use and recycling: After the new products reach the consumers, they are used and eventually become waste again. Ideally, consumers will dispose of these items responsibly by recycling them, allowing them to re-enter the recycling process as a reusable material once more. In conclusion, the last step in the recycling process is the manufacturing, distribution, and subsequent use of new products made from the recycled materials. This step serves a crucial role in completing the recycling loop, helping to conserve resources, minimize waste, and reduce the overall environmental impact of our consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
